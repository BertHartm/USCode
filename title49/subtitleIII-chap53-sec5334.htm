<p class="note-body">In subsections (c)&ndash;(f), and (j), the relevant substantive provisions of 12:1749a are substituted for &ldquo;shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have the functions, powers, and duties set forth in section 1749a of title 12, except subsections (c)(2) and (f) of such section&rdquo; for clarity. The reference to subsection (c)(2) is omitted as obsolete because section 201(d)(1) of the Housing and Community Development Technical Amendments Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;479, 98 Stat. 2228) repealed 12:1749a(c)(2). The words &ldquo;(in addition to any authority otherwise vested in him)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1608(a) (1st sentence related to 12:1749a(c)(8)) is omitted as obsolete.

In clause (1), the words &ldquo;(except terms the Secretary of Labor prescribes under section 5333(b) of this title)&rdquo; are added for clarity because 49 App.:1608(a) only applies to the Secretary of Transportation and does not supersede the responsibility of the Secretary of Labor. In clause (3), the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; is added for clarity. The words &ldquo;contract, or other&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (4), the words &ldquo;bid for and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at any foreclosure or any other sale&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (6), the words &ldquo;at public or private sale&rdquo;, &ldquo;real or personal&rdquo;, and &ldquo;upon such terms as he may fix&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. Clause (8) is substituted for 49 App.:1608(a) (1st sentence related to 12:1749a(c)(7)) to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (9), the word &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;carry out this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;assure that the purposes of this subchapter will be achieved&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;regulatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulatory proceeding&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;rulemaking&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and because &ldquo;rule&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; are synonymous.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;Federal Transit Administration&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Urban Mass Transportation Administration&rdquo; because of section 3004(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 2088). The words &ldquo;also&rdquo; and &ldquo;required by the first sentence of this paragraph&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;In the performance of, and with respect to, the functions, powers, and duties vested in him by this subchapter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. notwithstanding the provisions of any other law&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;prepare .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and&rdquo; and &ldquo;for wholly owned Government corporations&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:250 --><p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;such .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as the making of loans&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;under this chapter&rdquo; are added for clarity. The word &ldquo;related&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;in connection with such financial transactions&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;approved by the Secretary&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;binding&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;final and conclusive&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;and employees&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;in any way&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;complete, administer, remodel and convert, dispose of, lease and otherwise&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;civil or criminal&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;political subdivision of a State&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;local&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;facilities and equipment and other&rdquo;, &ldquo;(including land)&rdquo;, and &ldquo;first&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g)(3), the words &ldquo;and not in lieu of&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (i) is substituted for section 1(a)(1) (related to authority and functions reserved to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1968 to eliminate unnecessary words. The reference to 49 App.:1602(c)(1) is translated as a reference to 49 App.:1602(e)(1) because section 2(1) of the Urban Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970 (Public Law 91&ndash;453, 84 Stat. 962) redesignated subsection (c) as subsection (e). The references to 49 App.:1603(a) (1st sentence), 1604, and 1607c(b) and former 49 App.:1607a are omitted as obsolete because of section 103(a) of the National Mass Transportation Act of 1974 (Public Law 93&ndash;503, 88 Stat. 1567) and sections 303(b), 305(a), and 307 of the Federal Public Transportation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;599, 92 Stat. 2737, 2743, 2747). Reference to 49 App.:1607c(c) is omitted because it was enacted after the Reorganization Plan and was not intended to be within the scope of the Plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (j)(1) is substituted for 49 App.:1608(a) (1st sentence related to 12:1749a(e)) to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
