<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Reduced Fare Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall maintain a reduced fare program for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) individuals at least 65 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) individuals (except alcoholics and drug abusers) who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity of the individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have a record of an impairment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are regarded as having an impairment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions To Ensure Access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak may act to ensure access to intercity transportation for elderly or handicapped individuals on passenger trains operated by or for Amtrak. That action may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) acquiring special equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conducting special training for employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) designing and acquiring new equipment and facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) eliminating barriers in existing equipment and facilities to comply with the highest standards of design, construction, and alteration of property to accommodate elderly and handicapped individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing special assistance to elderly and handicapped individuals when getting on and off trains and in terminal areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Employee Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;rail carrier employee&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an active full-time employee of a rail carrier or terminal company and includes an employee on furlough or leave of absence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a retired employee of a rail carrier or terminal company; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a dependent of an employee referred to in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak shall ensure that a rail carrier employee eligible for free or reduced-rate rail transportation on April 30, 1971, under an agreement in effect on that date is eligible, to the greatest extent practicable, for free or reduced-rate intercity rail passenger transportation provided by Amtrak under this part, if space is available, on terms similar to those available on that date under the agreement. However, Amtrak may apply to all rail carrier employees eligible to receive free or reduced-rate transportation under any agreement a single systemwide schedule of terms that Amtrak decides applied to a majority of employees on that date under all those agreements. Unless Amtrak and a rail carrier make a different agreement, the carrier shall reimburse Amtrak at the rate of 25 percent of the systemwide average monthly yield of each revenue passenger-mile. The reimbursement is in place of costs Amtrak incurs related to free or reduced-rate transportation, including liability related to travel of a rail carrier employee eligible for free or reduced-rate transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection does not prohibit the Interstate Commerce Commission from ordering retroactive relief in a proceeding begun or reopened after October 1, 1981.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24308. Use of facilities and providing services to Amtrak</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak may make an agreement with a rail carrier or regional transportation authority to use facilities of, and have services provided by, the carrier or authority under terms on which the parties agree. The terms shall include a penalty for untimely performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the parties cannot agree and if the Interstate Commerce Commission finds it necessary to carry out this part, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) order that the facilities be made available and the services provided to Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) prescribe reasonable terms and compensation for using the facilities and providing the services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When prescribing reasonable compensation under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission shall consider quality of service as a major factor when determining whether, and the extent to which, the amount of compensation shall be greater than the incremental costs of using the facilities and providing the services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall decide the dispute not later than 90 days after Amtrak submits the dispute to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak's right to use the facilities or have the services provided is conditioned on payment of the compensation. If the compensation is not paid promptly, the rail carrier or authority entitled to it may bring an action against Amtrak to recover the amount owed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Amtrak shall seek immediate and appropriate legal remedies to enforce its contract rights when track maintenance on a route over which Amtrak operates falls below the contractual standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Operating During Emergencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To facilitate operation by Amtrak during an emergency, the Commission, on application by Amtrak, shall require a rail carrier to provide facilities immediately during the emergency. The Commission then shall promptly prescribe reasonable terms, including indemnification of the carrier by Amtrak against personal injury risk to which the carrier may be exposed. The rail carrier shall provide the facilities for the duration of the emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preference Over Freight Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except in an emergency, intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation provided by or for Amtrak has preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, junction, or crossing unless the Secretary of Transportation orders otherwise under this subsection. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may apply to the Secretary for relief. If the Secretary, after an opportunity for a hearing under section 553 of title 5, decides that preference for intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation materially will lessen the quality of freight transportation provided to shippers, the Secretary shall establish the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on reasonable terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Accelerated Speeds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a rail carrier refuses to allow accelerated speeds on trains operated by or for Amtrak, Amtrak may apply to the Secretary for an order requiring the carrier to allow the accelerated speeds. The Secretary shall decide whether accelerated speeds are unsafe or impracticable and which improvements would be required to make accelerated speeds safe and practicable. After an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary shall establish the maximum allowable speeds of Amtrak trains on terms the Secretary decides are reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Additional Trains</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When a rail carrier does not agree to provide, or allow Amtrak to provide, for the operation of additional trains over a rail line of the carrier, Amtrak may apply to the Secretary for an order requiring the carrier to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains. After a hearing on the record, the Secretary may order the carrier, within 60 days, to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains on a schedule based on legally permissible operating times. However, if the Secretary decides not to hold a hearing, the Secretary, not later than 30 days after receiving the application, shall publish in the Federal Register the reasons for the decision not to hold the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when conducting a hearing, whether an order would impair unreasonably freight transportation of the rail carrier, with the carrier having the burden of demonstrating that the additional trains will impair the freight transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when establishing scheduled running times, the statutory goal of Amtrak to implement schedules that attain a system-wide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be adhered to with a high degree of reliability and passenger comfort.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Unless the parties have an agreement that establishes the compensation Amtrak will pay the carrier for additional trains provided under an order under this subsection, the Commission shall decide the dispute under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24309. Retaining and maintaining facilities</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;facility&rdquo; means a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, facility, or real property related to a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, or facility, including a signal system, passenger station and repair tracks, a station building, a platform, and a related facility, including a water, fuel, steam, electric, and air line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) downgrading a facility means reducing a track classification as specified in the Federal Railroad Administration track safety standards or altering a facility so that the time required for rail passenger transportation to be provided over the route on which a facility is located may be increased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval Required for Downgrading or Disposal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A facility of a rail carrier or re<!-- PDFPage:316 -->gional transportation authority that Amtrak used to provide rail passenger transportation on February 1, 1979, may be downgraded or disposed of only after approval by the Secretary of Transportation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification and Analysis</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A rail carrier intending to downgrade or dispose of a facility Amtrak currently is not using to provide transportation shall notify Amtrak of its intention. If, not later than 60 days after Amtrak receives the notice, Amtrak and the carrier do not agree to retain or maintain the facility or to convey an interest in the facility to Amtrak, the carrier may apply to the Secretary for approval to downgrade or dispose of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a rail carrier notifies Amtrak of its intention to downgrade or dispose of a facility, Amtrak shall survey population centers with rail passenger transportation facilities to assist in preparing a valid and timely analysis of the need for the facility and shall update the survey as appropriate. Amtrak also shall maintain a system for collecting information gathered in the survey. The system shall collect the information based on geographic regions and on whether the facility would be part of a short haul or long haul route. The survey should facilitate an analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ridership potential by ascertaining existing and changing travel patterns that would provide maximum efficient rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quality of transportation of competitors or likely competitors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the likelihood of Amtrak offering transportation at a competitive fare;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) opportunities to target advertising and fares to potential classes of riders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) economic characteristics of rail passenger transportation related to the facility and the extent to which the characteristics are consistent with sound economic principles of short haul or long haul rail transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the feasibility of applying effective internal cost controls to the facility and route served by the facility to improve the ratio of passenger revenue to transportation expenses (excluding maintenance of tracks, structures, and equipment and depreciation).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Approval of Application and Payment of Avoidable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If Amtrak does not object to an application not later than 30 days after it is submitted, the Secretary shall approve the application promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If Amtrak objects to an application, the Secretary shall decide by not later than 180 days after the objection those costs the rail carrier may avoid if it does not have to retain or maintain a facility in the condition Amtrak requests. If Amtrak does not agree by not later than 60 days after the decision to pay the carrier these avoidable costs, the Secretary shall approve the application. When deciding whether to pay a carrier the avoidable costs of retaining or maintaining a facility, Amtrak shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the potential importance of restoring rail passenger transportation on the route on which the facility is located;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24311. Acquiring interests in property by eminent domain</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent financial resources are available, Amtrak may acquire by eminent domain under subsection (b) of this section interests in property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, except property of a rail carrier, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a governmental authority; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requested by the Secretary of Transportation in carrying out the Secretary's duty to design and build an intermodal transportation terminal at Union Station in the District of Columbia if the Secretary assures Amtrak that the Secretary will reimburse Amtrak.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak may exercise the power of eminent domain only if it cannot&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquire the interest in the property by contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) agree with the owner on the purchase price for the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A civil action to acquire an interest in property by eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section must be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the property is located or, if a single piece of property is located in more than one judicial district, in any judicial district in which any piece of the property is located. An interest is condemned and taken by Amtrak for its use when a declaration of taking is filed under this subsection and an amount of money estimated in the declaration to be just compensation for the interest is deposited in the court. The declaration may be filed with the complaint in the action or at any time before judgment. The declaration must contain or be accompanied by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of the public use for which the interest is taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of the property sufficient to identify it;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a statement of the interest in the property taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a plan showing the interest taken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a statement of the amount of money Amtrak estimates is just compensation for the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the declaration is filed and the deposit is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, title to the property vests in Amtrak in fee simple absolute or in the lesser interest shown in the declaration, and the right to the money vests in the person entitled to the money. When the declaration is filed, the court may decide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the time by which, and the terms under which, possession of the property is given to Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the disposition of outstanding charges related to the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After a hearing, the court shall make a finding on the amount that is just compensation for the interest in the property and enter judgment awarding that amount and interest on it. The rate of interest is 6 percent a year and is computed on the amount of the award less the amount deposited in the court from the date of taking to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) On application of a party, the court may order immediate payment of any part of the amount deposited in the court for the compensation to be awarded. If the award is more than the amount received, the court shall enter judgment against Amtrak for the deficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Condemn Rail Carrier Property Interests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If Amtrak and a rail carrier cannot agree on a sale to Amtrak of an interest in property of a rail carrier necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, Amtrak may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order establishing the need of Amtrak for the interest and requiring the carrier to convey the interest on reasonable terms, including just compensation. The need of Amtrak is deemed to be established, and the Commission, after holding an expedited proceeding and not later than 120 days after receiving the application, shall order the interest conveyed unless the Commission decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conveyance would impair significantly the ability of the carrier to carry out its obligations as a common carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the obligations of Amtrak to provide modern, efficient, and economical rail passenger transportation can be met adequately by acquiring an interest in other property, either by sale or by exercising its right of eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the amount of compensation is not determined by the date of the Commission's order, the order shall require, as part of the compensation, interest at 6 percent a year from the date prescribed for the conveyance until the compensation is paid.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:318 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak subsequently may reconvey to a third party an interest conveyed to Amtrak under this subsection or prior comparable provision of law if the Commission decides that the reconveyance will carry out the purposes of this part, regardless of when the proceeding was brought (including a proceeding pending before a United States court on November 28, 1990).</p>

Amtrak may make such an agreement only after being assured that required labor standards will be maintained on the construction work. Health and safety standards prescribed by the Secretary under section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 333) apply to all construction work performed under such an agreement, except for construction work performed by a rail carrier.</p>
