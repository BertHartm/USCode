A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may charge a shipper, consignee, or owner an extra amount for those services only if, under Commission regulations, the unloading or reloading in route is at the request of the shipper, consignee, or owner, to try an intermediate market, or to comply with quarantine regulations.</p>
