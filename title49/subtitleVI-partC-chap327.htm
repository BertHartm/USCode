<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation that include the way in which information is disclosed and retained under this section, a person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle shall give the transferee the following written disclosure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Disclosure of the cumulative mileage registered on the odometer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Disclosure that the actual mileage is unknown, if the transferor knows that the odometer reading is different from the number of miles the vehicle has actually traveled.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle may not violate a regulation prescribed under this section or give a false statement to the transferee in making the disclosure required by such a regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person acquiring a motor vehicle for resale may not accept a written disclosure under this section unless it is complete.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) This subsection shall apply to all transfers of motor vehicles (unless otherwise exempted by the Secretary by regulation), except in the case of transfers of new motor vehicles from a vehicle manufacturer jointly to a dealer and a person engaged in the business of renting or leasing vehicles for a period of 30 days or less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;new motor vehicle&rdquo; means any motor vehicle driven with no more than the limited use necessary in moving, transporting, or road testing such vehicle prior to delivery from the vehicle manufacturer to a dealer, but in no event shall the odometer reading of such vehicle exceed 300 miles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may exempt such classes or categories of vehicles as the Secretary deems appropriate from these requirements. Until such time as the Secretary amends or modifies the regulations set forth in 49 CFR 580.6, such regulations shall have full force and effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Mileage Statement Requirement for Licensing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A motor vehicle the ownership of which is transferred may not be licensed for use in a State unless the transferee, in submitting an application to a State for the title on which the license will be issued, includes with the application the transferor's title and, if that title contains the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection, a statement, signed and dated by the transferor, of the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. This paragraph does not apply to a transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle that has not been licensed before the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the title to a motor vehicle issued to a transferor by a State is in the possession of a lienholder when the transferor transfers ownership of the vehicle, the transferor may use a written power of attorney (if allowed by State law) in making the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. Regulations prescribed under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall prescribe the form of the power of attorney;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall provide that the form be printed by means of a secure printing process (or other secure process);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall provide that the State issue the form to the transferee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) shall provide that the person exercising the power of attorney retain a copy and submit the original to the State with a copy of the title showing the restatement of the mileage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) may require that the State retain the power of attorney and the copy of the title for an appropriate period or that the State adopt alternative measures consistent with section 32701(b) of this title, after considering the costs to the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) shall ensure that the mileage at the time of transfer be disclosed on the power of attorney document;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) shall ensure that the mileage be restated exactly by the person exercising the power of attorney in the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) may not require that a motor vehicle be titled in the State in which the power of attorney was issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ix) shall consider the need to facilitate normal commercial transactions in the sale or exchange of motor vehicles; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; means a valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter sufficient to justify the inspection or impoundment in the circumstances stated in an application for a warrant under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Warrant Requirement and Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this sub<!-- PDFPage:614 -->section, an inspection or impoundment under section 32706 of this title may be carried out only after a warrant is obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A judge of a court of the United States or a State court of record or a United States magistrate may issue a warrant for an inspection or impoundment under section 32706 of this title within the territorial jurisdiction of the court or magistrate. The warrant must be based on an affidavit that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establishes probable cause to issue the warrant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is sworn to before the judge or magistrate by an officer or employee who knows the facts alleged in the affidavit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The judge or magistrate shall issue the warrant when the judge or magistrate decides there is a reasonable basis for believing that probable cause exists to issue the warrant. The warrant must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identify the premises, property, or motor vehicle to be inspected and the items or type of property to be impounded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) state the purpose of the inspection, the basis for issuing the warrant, and the name of the affiant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) direct an individual authorized under section 32706 of this title to inspect the premises, property, or vehicle for the purpose stated in the warrant and, when appropriate, to impound the property specified in the warrant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) direct that the warrant be served during the hours specified in the warrant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) name the judge or magistrate with whom proof of service is to be filed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A warrant under this section is not required when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the premises consents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is reasonable to believe that the mobility of the motor vehicle to be inspected makes it impractical to obtain a warrant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an application for a warrant cannot be made because of an emergency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) records are to be inspected and copied under section 32706(e)(1)(A) of this title; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service and Impoundment of Property</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A warrant issued under this section must be served and proof of service filed not later than 10 days after its issuance date. The judge or magistrate may allow additional time in the warrant if the Secretary of Transportation demonstrates a need for additional time. Proof of service must be filed promptly with a written inventory of the property impounded under the warrant. The inventory shall be made in the presence of the individual serving the warrant and the individual from whose possession or premises the property was impounded, or if that individual is not present, a credible individual except the individual making the inventory. The individual serving the warrant shall verify the inventory. On request, the judge or magistrate shall send a copy of the inventory to the individual from whose possession or premises the property was impounded and to the applicant for the warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When property is impounded under a warrant, the individual serving the warrant shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the property was impounded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The judge or magistrate shall file the warrant, proof of service, and all documents filed about the warrant with the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which the inspection is made.</p>
