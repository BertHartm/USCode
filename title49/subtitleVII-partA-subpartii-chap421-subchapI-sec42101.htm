<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;major contraction&rdquo; means a reduction (except as provided in subsection (b) of this section) of at least 7.5 percent in the number of full-time employees of an air carrier within a 12-month period, except for employees deprived of employment because of a strike or whose employment is ended for cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;protected employee&rdquo; means an individual who on October 24, 1978, had been employed for at least 4 years by an air carrier that held a certificate under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, but does not include a director or officer of a corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &ldquo;qualifying dislocation&rdquo; means a bankruptcy or major contraction of an air carrier holding a certificate under section 41102 of this title when the Secretary of Transportation finds the bankruptcy or contraction occurred after December 31, 1978, and before January 1, 1989, the major cause of which was the change in regulatory structure provided by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.</p>
