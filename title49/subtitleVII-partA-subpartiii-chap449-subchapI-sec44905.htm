<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Guidelines on Public Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The President shall develop guidelines for ensuring that public notice is provided in appropriate cases about threats to civil aviation.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) canceling the departure of a flight or series of flights under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The guidelines shall provide for consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the specificity of the threat;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the credibility of intelligence information related to the threat;</p>
