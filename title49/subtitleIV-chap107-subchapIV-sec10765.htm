<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may require a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to its jurisdiction under chapter 105 of this title that makes an arrangement with a water carrier (whether or not subject to its jurisdiction under this subtitle) providing transportation from a port in the United States to another country for the through transportation of property from a place in the interior of the United States to another country to make similar arrangements with steamship lines that provide transportation from that port to that country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title that transports property from a place in the United States through another country to a place in the United States shall publish and keep open for public inspection tariffs as required under section 10762 of this title. The tariffs shall identify the through rate established for that transportation to the United States from another country to which the carrier accepts property for shipment from the United States. Unless the through rates are available for public inspection under that section, the property is subject to customs duties applicable to property produced in another country before the property may be admitted to the United States.</p>

The words &ldquo;by order&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement. The word &ldquo;place&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;points&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;handling of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. business&rdquo; in view of the definition of &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; in section 10102 of this title. The words &ldquo;steamship lines&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any or all other lines of steamships&rdquo; for clarity.
