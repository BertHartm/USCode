<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Regulations Limiting Reduced Rates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the Commission shall issue regulations that prohibit a motor carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title from providing a reduction in a rate set forth in its tariff or contract for the provision of transportation of property to any person other than (1) the person paying the motor carrier directly for the transportation service according to the bill of lading, receipt, or contract, or (2) an agent of the person paying for the transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of Actual Rates, Charges, and Allowances</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations of the Commission issued pursuant to this section shall require a motor carrier to disclose, when a document is presented or transmitted electronically for payment to the person responsible directly to the motor carrier for payment or agent of such responsible person, the actual rates, charges, or allowances for the transportation service and shall prohibit any person from causing a motor carrier to present false or misleading information on a document about the actual rate, charge, or allowance to any party to the transaction. Where the actual rate, charge, or allowance is dependent upon the performance of a service by a party to the transportation arrangement, such as tendering a volume of freight over a stated period of time, the motor carrier shall indicate in any document presented for payment to the person responsible directly to the motor carrier for the payment that a reduction, allowance, or other adjustment may apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payments or Allowances for Certain Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations issued by the Commission pursuant to this section shall not prohibit a motor carrier from making payments or allowances to a party to the transaction for services that would otherwise be performed by the motor carrier, such as a loading or unloading service, if the payments or allowances are reasonably related to the cost that such party knows or has reason to know would otherwise be incurred by the motor carrier.</p>
