<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may not discharge an employee, or discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding pay, terms, or privileges of employment, because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employee, or another person at the employee's request, has filed a complaint or begun a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety regulation, standard, or order, or has testified or will testify in such a proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employee refuses to operate a vehicle because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the operation violates a regulation, standard, or order of the United States related to commercial motor vehicle safety or health; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle's unsafe condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection, an employee's apprehension of serious <!-- PDFPage:455 -->injury is reasonable only if a reasonable individual in the circumstances then confronting the employee would conclude that the unsafe condition establishes a real danger of accident, injury, or serious impairment to health. To qualify for protection, the employee must have sought from the employer, and been unable to obtain, correction of the unsafe condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Filing Complaints and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An employee alleging discharge, discipline, or discrimination in violation of subsection (a) of this section, or another person at the employee's request, may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor not later than 180 days after the alleged violation occurred. On receiving the complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person alleged to have committed the violation of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than 60 days after receiving a complaint, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation, decide whether it is reasonable to believe the complaint has merit, and notify the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation of the findings. If the Secretary decides it is reasonable to believe a violation occurred, the Secretary shall include with the decision findings and a preliminary order for the relief provided under paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 30 days after the notice under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of objections does not stay a reinstatement ordered in the preliminary order. If a hearing is not requested within the 30 days, the preliminary order is final and not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A hearing shall be conducted expeditiously. Not later than 120 days after the end of the hearing, the Secretary shall issue a final order. Before the final order is issued, the proceeding may be ended by a settlement agreement made by the Secretary, the complainant, and the person alleged to have committed the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the Secretary decides, on the basis of a complaint, a person violated subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall order the person to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) take affirmative action to abate the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) reinstate the complainant to the former position with the same pay and terms and privileges of employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) pay compensatory damages, including back pay.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary issues an order under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the complainant requests, the Secretary may assess against the person against whom the order is issued the costs (including attorney's fees) reasonably incurred by the complainant in bringing the complaint. The Secretary shall determine the costs that reasonably were incurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Review and Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person adversely affected by an order issued after a hearing under subsection (b) of this section may file a petition for review, not later than 60 days after the order is issued, in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the violation occurred or the person resided on the date of the violation. The review shall be heard and decided expeditiously. An order of the Secretary subject to review under this subsection is not subject to judicial review in a criminal or other civil proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Enforce</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person fails to comply with an order issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall bring a civil action to enforce the order in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the violation occurred.</p>
