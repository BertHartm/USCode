<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriate participation by all underground facility operators, including all government operators;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Appropriate Participation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining the appropriate extent of participation required for types of underground facilities or excavators under subsection (a), a State shall assess, rank, and take into consideration the risks to the public safety, the environment, excavators, and vital public services associated with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) damage to types of underground facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) activities of types of excavators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Implementation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State one-call notification program also shall, at a minimum, provide for and document&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) increased penalties for parties that repeatedly damage underground facilities because they fail to use one-call notification systems or for parties that repeatedly fail to provide timely and accurate marking after the required call has been made to a one-call notification system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reduced or waived penalties for a violation of a requirement of a State one-call notification program that results in, or could result in, damage that is promptly reported by the violator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) equitable relief; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) citation of violations.</p>
