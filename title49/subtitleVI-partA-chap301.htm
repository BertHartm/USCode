<!-- PDFPage:386 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When a motor vehicle safety standard is in effect under this chapter, a State or a political subdivision of a State may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment only if the standard is identical to the standard prescribed under this chapter. However, the United States Government, a State, or a political subdivision of a State may prescribe a standard for a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement than that required by the otherwise applicable standard under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe motor vehicle safety standards. Each standard shall be practicable, meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and be stated in objective terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Considerations and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a motor vehicle safety standard under this chapter, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider relevant available motor vehicle safety information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with the agency established under the Act of August 20, 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;684, 72 Stat. 635), and other appropriate State or interstate authorities (including legislative committees);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider whether a proposed standard is reasonable, practicable, and appropriate for the particular type of motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment for which it is prescribed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the extent to which the standard will carry out section 30101 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may advise, assist, and cooperate with departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government, States, and other public and private agencies in developing motor vehicle safety standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effective Dates of Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall specify the effective date of a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter in the order prescribing the standard. A standard may not become effective before the 180th day after the standard is prescribed or later than one year after it is prescribed. However, the Secretary may prescribe a different effective date after finding, for good cause shown, that a different effective date is in the public interest and publishing the reasons for the finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) 5-<cap-smallcap>Year Plan for Testing Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish and periodically review and update on a continuing basis a 5-year plan for testing motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter that the Secretary considers capable of being tested. In developing the plan and establishing testing priorities, the Secretary shall consider factors the Secretary considers appropriate, consistent with section 30101 of this title and the Secretary's other duties and powers under this chapter. The Secretary may change at any time those priorities to address matters the Secretary considers of greater priority. The initial plan may be the 5-year plan for compliance testing in effect on December 18, 1991.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;30113. General exemptions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;low-emission motor vehicle&rdquo; means a motor vehicle meeting the standards for new motor vehicles applicable to the vehicle under section 202 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521) when the vehicle is manufactured and emitting an air pollutant in an amount significantly below one of those standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Exempt and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may exempt, on a temporary basis, motor vehicles from a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter or passenger motor vehicles from a bumper standard prescribed under chapter 325 of this title, on terms the Secretary considers appropriate. An exemption may be renewed. A renewal may be granted only on reapplication and must conform to the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:389 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may begin a proceeding under this subsection when a manufacturer applies for an exemption or a renewal of an exemption. The Secretary shall publish notice of the application and provide an opportunity to comment. An application for an exemption or for a renewal of an exemption shall be filed at a time and in the way, and contain information, this section and the Secretary require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may act under this subsection on finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an exemption is consistent with the public interest and this chapter or chapter 325 of this title (as applicable); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) compliance with the standard would cause substantial economic hardship to a manufacturer that has tried to comply with the standard in good faith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the exemption would make easier the development or field evaluation of a new motor vehicle safety feature providing a safety level at least equal to the safety level of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the exemption would make the development or field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle easier and would not unreasonably lower the safety level of that vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) compliance with the standard would prevent the manufacturer from selling a motor vehicle with an overall safety level at least equal to the overall safety level of nonexempt vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contents of Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer applying for an exemption under subsection (b) of this section shall include the following information in the application:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section, a complete financial statement describing the economic hardship and a complete description of the manufacturer's good faith effort to comply with each motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter, or a bumper standard prescribed under chapter 325 of this title, from which the manufacturer is requesting an exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii) of this section, a record of the research, development, and testing establishing the innovative nature of the safety feature and a detailed analysis establishing that the safety level of the feature at least equals the safety level of the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(iii) of this section, a record of the research, development, and testing establishing that the motor vehicle is a low-emission motor vehicle and that the safety level of the vehicle is not lowered unreasonably by exemption from the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(iv) of this section, a detailed analysis showing how the vehicle provides an overall safety level at least equal to the overall safety level of nonexempt vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer is eligible for an exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section (including an exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) relating to a bumper standard referred to in subsection (b)(1)) only if the Secretary determines that the manufacturer's total motor vehicle production in the most recent year of production is not more than 10,000. A manufacturer is eligible for an exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section only if the Secretary determines the exemption is for not more than 2,500 vehicles to be sold in the United States in any 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An exemption or renewal under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section may be granted for not more than 3 years. An exemption or renewal under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may be granted for not more than 2 years.</p>

The Secretary may prescribe by regulation the records to be maintained and reasonable procedures for maintaining the records under this subsection, including procedures to be followed by distributors and dealers to assist the manufacturer in obtaining the information required by this subsection. A procedure shall be reasonable for the type of vehicle or tire involved, and shall provide reasonable assurance that a customer list of a distributor or dealer, or similar information, will be made available to a person (except the distributor or dealer) only when necessary to carry out this subsection and sections 30118&ndash;30121, 30166(f), and 30167(a) and (b) of this title. Availability of assistance from a distributor or dealer does not affect an obligation of a manufacturer under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Secretary may require a distributor or dealer to maintain a record under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the business of the distributor or dealer is owned or controlled by a manufacturer of tires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall require each distributor and dealer whose business is not owned or controlled by a manufacturer of tires to give a registration form (containing the tire identification number) to the first purchaser of a tire. The Secretary shall prescribe the form, which shall be standardized for all tires and designed to allow the purchaser to complete and return it directly to the manufacturer of the tire. The manufacturer shall give sufficient copies of forms to distributors and dealers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall evaluate from time to time how successful the procedures under paragraph (2) of this subsection have been in helping to maintain records about first purchasers of tires. After each evaluation, the Secretary shall decide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the extent to which distributors and dealers have complied with the procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have encouraged first purchasers of tires to register the tires; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) whether to prescribe for manufacturers, distributors, or dealers other requirements that the Secretary decides will increase significantly the percentage of first purchasers of tires about whom records are maintained.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may prescribe a requirement under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only if the Secretary decides it is necessary to reduce the risk to motor vehicle safety, after considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the cost of the requirement to manufacturers and the burden of the requirement on distributors and dealers, compared to the increase in the percentage of first purchasers of tires about whom records would be maintained as a result of the requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have complied with the procedures in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have encouraged first purchasers of tires to register the tires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A manufacturer of tires shall reimburse distributors and dealers of that manufacturer's tires for all reasonable costs incurred by the distributors and dealers in complying with a requirement prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) After making a decision under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall submit to each House of Congress a report containing a detailed statement of the decision and an explanation of the reasons for the decision.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notification by Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall notify the manufacturer of a motor vehicle or replacement equipment immediately after making an initial decision (through testing, inspection, investigation, or research carried out under this chapter, examining communications under section 30166(f) of this title, or otherwise) that the vehicle or equipment contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter.

Subject to section 30167(a) of this title, the notification and information are available to any interested person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Defect and Noncompliance Proceedings and Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may make a final decision that a motor vehicle or replacement equipment contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter only after giving the manufacturer an opportunity to present information, views, and arguments showing that there is no defect or noncompliance or that the defect does not affect motor vehicle safety. Any interested person also shall be given an opportunity to present information, views, and arguments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary decides under paragraph (1) of this subsection that the vehicle or equipment contains the defect or does not comply, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give notification under section 30119 of this title to the owners, purchasers, and dealers of the vehicle or equipment of the defect or noncompliance; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) decides in good faith that the vehicle or equipment does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;30120. Remedies for defects and noncompliance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Ways To Remedy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, when notification of a defect or noncompliance is required under section 30118(b) or (c) of this title, the manufacturer of the defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment shall remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge when the vehicle or equipment is presented for remedy. Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the manufacturer shall remedy the defect or noncompliance in any of the following ways the manufacturer chooses:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if a vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by repairing the vehicle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) by replacing the vehicle with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) by refunding the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if replacement equipment, by repairing the equipment or replacing the equipment <!-- PDFPage:396 -->with identical or reasonably equivalent equipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations to allow the manufacturer to impose conditions on the replacement of a motor vehicle or refund of its price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Tire Remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer of a tire, including an original equipment tire, shall remedy a defective or noncomplying tire if the owner or purchaser presents the tire for remedy not later than 60 days after the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the day the owner or purchaser receives notification under section 30119 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the manufacturer decides to replace the tire, the day the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement is available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the manufacturer decides to replace the tire and the replacement is not available during the 60-day period, the owner or purchaser must present the tire for remedy during a subsequent 60-day period that begins only after the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement will be available during the subsequent period. If tires are available during the subsequent period, only a tire presented for remedy during that period must be remedied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Adequacy of Repairs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a manufacturer decides to repair a defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment and the repair is not done adequately within a reasonable time, the manufacturer shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) replace the vehicle or equipment without charge with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle or equipment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for a vehicle, refund the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Failure to repair a motor vehicle or replacement equipment adequately not later than 60 days after its presentation is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. However, the Secretary may extend, by order, the 60-day period if good cause for an extension is shown and the reason is published in the Federal Register before the period ends. Presentation of a vehicle or equipment for repair before the date specified by a manufacturer in a notice under section 30119(a)(5) or 30121(c)(2) of this title is not a presentation under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Filing Manufacturer's Remedy Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer shall file with the Secretary a copy of the manufacturer's program under this section for remedying a defect or noncompliance. The Secretary shall make the program available to the public and publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Hearings About Meeting Remedy Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the motion of the Secretary or on application by any interested person, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the remedy requirements under this section. Any interested person may make written and oral presentations of information, views, and arguments on whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the remedy requirements. If the Secretary decides a manufacturer has not reasonably met the remedy requirements, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer to take specified action to meet those requirements and may take any other action authorized under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Fair Reimbursement to Dealers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer shall pay fair reimbursement to a dealer providing a remedy without charge under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The requirement that a remedy be provided without charge does not apply if the motor vehicle or replacement equipment was bought by the first purchaser more than 8 calendar years, or the tire, including an original equipment tire, was bought by the first purchaser more than 3 calendar years, before notice is given under section 30118(c) of this title or an order is issued under section 30118(b) of this title, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not apply during any period in which enforcement of an order under section 30118(b) of this title is restrained or the order is set aside in a civil action to which section 30121(d) of this title applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary shall exempt the manufacturer from this section if the Secretary decides a defect or noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. The Secretary may take action under this subsection only after notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for any interested person to present information, views, and arguments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Sale or Lease</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If notification is required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title or is required under section 30118(c) of this title and the manufacturer has provided to a dealer (including retailers of motor vehicle equipment) notification about a new motor vehicle or new item of replacement equipment in the dealer's possession at the time of notification that contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter, the dealer may sell or lease the motor vehicle or item of replacement equipment only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the defect or noncompliance is remedied as required by this section before delivery under the sale or lease; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the notification is required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title, enforcement of the order is restrained or the order is set aside in a civil action to which section 30121(d) of this title applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not prohibit a dealer from offering for sale or lease the vehicle or equipment.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inflatable Restraint Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than September 1, 1993, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe under this chapter an amendment to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 issued under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. The amendment shall require that the automatic occupant crash protection system for both of the front outboard seating positions for each of the following vehicles be an inflatable restraint (with lap and shoulder belts) complying with the occupant protection requirements under section 4.1.2.1 of Standard 208:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 95 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of passenger cars manufactured after August 31, 1996, and before September 1, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 80 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks (except walk-in van-type trucks and vehicles designed to be sold only to the United States Postal Service) with a gross vehicle weight rating of not more than 8,500 pounds and an unloaded vehicle weight of not more than 5,500 pounds manufactured after August 31, 1997, and before September 1, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 100 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of passenger cars manufactured after August 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 100 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of vehicles described in clause (B) of this paragraph manufactured after August 31, 1998.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Manufacturers may not use credits and incentives available before September 1, 1998, under the provisions of Standard 208 (as amended by this section) to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection after August 31, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Owner Manual Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In amending Standard 208, the Secretary of Transportation shall require, to be effective as soon as possible after the amendment is prescribed, that owner manuals for passenger cars, buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks equipped with an inflatable restraint include a statement in an easily understandable format stating that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) either or both of the front outboard seating positions of the vehicle are equipped with an inflatable restraint referred to as an &ldquo;airbag&rdquo; and a lap and shoulder belt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the &ldquo;airbag&rdquo; is a supplemental restraint and is not a substitute for lap and shoulder belts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) lap and shoulder belts also must be used correctly by an occupant in a front outboard seating position to provide restraint or protection from frontal crashes as well as other types of crashes or accidents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) occupants should always wear their lap and shoulder belts, if available, or other safety belts, whether or not there is an inflatable restraint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Seat Belt Use Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that it is in the public interest for each State to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use laws and for the United States Government to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Temporary Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary of Transportation may exempt, on a temporary basis, motor vehicles of that manufacturer from any requirement under subsections (b) and (c) of this section on terms the Secretary considers appropriate. An exemption may be renewed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may grant an exemption under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the Secretary finds that there has been a disruption in the supply of any component of an inflatable restraint or in the use and installation of that component by the manufacturer because of an unavoidable event not under the control of the manufacturer that will prevent the manufacturer from meeting its anticipated production volume of vehicles with those restraints.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Only an affected manufacturer may apply for an exemption. The Secretary of Transpor<!-- PDFPage:402 -->tation shall prescribe in the amendment to Standard 208 required under this section the information an affected manufacturer must include in its application under this subsection. The manufacturer shall specify in the application the models, lines, and types of vehicles affected. The Secretary may consolidate similar applications from different manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An exemption or renewal of an exemption is conditioned on the commitment of the manufacturer to recall the exempted vehicles for installation of the omitted inflatable restraints within a reasonable time that the manufacturer proposes and the Secretary of Transportation approves after the components become available in sufficient quantities to satisfy both anticipated production and recall volume requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of Transportation shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of each application under this subsection and each decision to grant or deny a temporary exemption and the reasons for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary of Transportation shall require a label for each exempted vehicle that can be removed only after recall and installation of the required inflatable restraint. The Secretary shall require that written notice of the exemption be provided to the dealer and the first purchaser of each exempted vehicle other than for resale, with the notice being provided in a way, and containing the information, the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) This section revises, but does not replace, Standard 208 as in effect on December 18, 1991, including the amendment of March 26, 1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 12472), to Standard 208, extending the requirements for automatic crash protection, with incentives for more innovative automatic crash protection, to trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles. This section may not be construed as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) affecting another provision of law carried out by the Secretary of Transportation applicable to passenger cars, buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, or trucks; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establishing a precedent related to developing or prescribing a Government motor vehicle safety standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section and amendments to Standard 208 made under this section may not be construed as indicating an intention by Congress to affect any liability of a motor vehicle manufacturer under applicable law related to vehicles with or without inflatable restraints.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On October 1, 1992, and annually after that date through October 1, 2000, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit reports on the effectiveness of occupant restraint systems expressed as a percentage reduction in fatalities or injuries of restrained occupants compared to unrestrained occupants for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a combination of inflated restraints and lap and shoulder belts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inflated restraints only; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) lap and shoulder belts only.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Defense, the Secretary of Transportation also shall provide information and analysis on lap and shoulder belt use, nationally and in each State by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) military personnel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Government, State, and local law enforcement officers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) other Government and State employees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the public.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Airbags for Government Cars</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In cooperation with the Administrator of General Services and the heads of appropriate departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish a program, consistent with applicable procurement laws of the Government and available appropriations, requiring that all passenger cars acquired&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after September 30, 1994, for use by the Government be equipped, to the maximum extent practicable, with driver-side inflatable restraints; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after September 30, 1996, for use by the Government be equipped, to the maximum extent practicable, with inflatable restraints for both front outboard seating positions.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Notice of proposed rulemaking</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than September 1, 1998, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to improve occupant protection for occupants of different sizes, belted and unbelted, under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, while minimizing the risk to infants, children, and other occupants from injuries and deaths caused by air bags, by means that include advanced air bags.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Final rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall complete the rulemaking required by this subsection by issuing, not later than September 1, 1999, a final rule with any provision the Secretary deems appropriate, consistent with paragraph (1) and the requirements of section 30111, title 49, United States Code. If the Secretary determines that the final rule cannot be completed by that date to meet the purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary may extend the date for issuing the final rule to not later than March 1, 2000.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Effective date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The final rule issued under this subsection shall become effective in phases as rapidly as practicable, beginning not earlier than September 1, 2002, and no sooner than 30 months after the date of the issuance of the final rule, but not later than September 1, 2003. The final rule shall become fully effective for all vehicles identified in section 30127(b), title 49, United States Code, that are manufactured on and after September 1, 2005.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 30112(a) of this title does not apply to a motor vehicle if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on petition of a manufacturer or importer registered under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary decides&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the vehicle is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for import into and sale in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) certified under section 30115 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the same model year (as defined under regulations of the Secretary of Transportation) as the model of the motor vehicle it is being compared to; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) capable of being readily altered to comply with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if there is no substantially similar United States motor vehicle, the safety features of the vehicle comply with or are capable of being altered to comply with those standards based on destructive test information or other evidence the Secretary of Transportation decides is adequate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the vehicle is imported by a registered importer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the registered importer pays the annual fee the Secretary of Transportation establishes under subsection (e) of this section to <!-- PDFPage:404 -->pay for the costs of carrying out the registration program for importers under subsection (c) of this section and any other fees the Secretary of Transportation establishes to pay for the costs of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) processing bonds provided to the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) making the decisions under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Procedures on Deciding on Motor Vehicle Capability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall establish by regulation procedures for making a decision under subsection (a)(1) of this section and the information a petitioner must provide to show clearly that the motor vehicle is capable of being brought into compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter. In establishing the procedures, the Secretary shall provide for a minimum period of public notice and written comment consistent with ensuring expeditious, but complete, consideration and avoiding delay by any person. In making a decision under those procedures, the Secretary shall consider test information and other information available to the Secretary, including any information provided by the manufacturer. If the Secretary makes a negative decision, the Secretary may not make another decision for the same model until at least 3 calendar months have elapsed after the negative decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall publish each year in the Federal Register a list of all decisions made under subsection (a)(1) of this section. Each published decision applies to the model of the motor vehicle for which the decision was made. A positive decision permits another importer registered under subsection (c) of this section to import a vehicle of the same model under this section if the importer complies with all the terms of the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Registration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall establish procedures for registering a person who complies with requirements prescribed by the Secretary by regulation under this subsection, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) recordkeeping requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inspection of records and facilities related to motor vehicles the person has imported, altered, or both; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) requirements that ensure that the importer (or a successor in interest) will be able technically and financially to carry out responsibilities under sections 30117(b), 30118&ndash;30121, and 30166(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall deny registration to a person whose registration is revoked under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Transportation may deny registration to a person that is or was owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or control with, a person whose registration was revoked under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Transportation shall establish procedures for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) revoking or suspending a registration issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection for not complying with a requirement of this subchapter or any of sections 30112, 30115, 30117&ndash;30122, 30125(c), 30127, or 30166 of this title or regulations prescribed under this subchapter or any of those sections;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) automatically suspending a registration for not paying a fee under subsection (a)(3) of this section in a timely manner or for knowingly filing a false or misleading certification under section 30146 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) reinstating suspended registrations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Bonds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person importing a motor vehicle under this section shall provide a bond to the Secretary of the Treasury (acting for the Secretary of Transportation) and comply with the terms the Secretary of Transportation decides are appropriate to ensure that the vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will comply with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter within a reasonable time (specified by the Secretary of Transportation) after the vehicle is imported; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will be exported (at no cost to the United States Government) by the Secretary of the Treasury or abandoned to the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of the bond provided under this subsection shall be at least equal to the dutiable value of the motor vehicle (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury) but not more than 150 percent of that value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Fee Review, Adjustment, and Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall review and make appropriate adjustments at least every 2 years in the amounts of the fees required to be paid under subsection (a)(3) of this section. The Secretary of Transportation shall establish the fees for each fiscal year before the beginning of that year. All fees collected remain available until expended without fiscal year limit to the extent provided in advance by appropriation laws. The amounts are only for use by the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in carrying out this section and sections 30146(a)&ndash;(c)(1), (d), and (e) and 30147(b) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in advancing to the Secretary of the Treasury amounts for costs incurred under this section and section 30146 of this title to reimburse the Secretary of the Treasury for those costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compliance Certification and Bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, an importer registered under section 30141(c) of this title may license or register an imported motor vehicle for use on public streets, roads, or highways, or release custody of a motor vehicle imported by the registered importer or imported by an individual under section 30142 of this title and altered by the registered importer to meet applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter to a person for license or registration for use on public streets, roads, or highways, only after 30 days after the registered importer certifies to the Secretary of Transportation, in the way the Secretary prescribes, that the motor vehicle complies with each standard prescribed in the year the vehicle was manufactured and that applies in that year to that vehicle. A vehicle may not be released if the Secretary gives written notice before the end of the 30-day period that the Secretary will inspect the vehicle under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretaries of Transportation and the Treasury shall prescribe regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensuring the release of a motor vehicle and bond required under section 30141(d) of this title at the end of the 30-day period, unless the Secretary of Transportation issues a notice of an inspection under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) providing that the Secretary of Transportation shall release the vehicle and bond promptly after an inspection under subsection (c) of this section showing compliance with the standards applicable to the vehicle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each registered importer shall include on each motor vehicle released under this subsection a label prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation identifying the importer and stating that the vehicle has been altered by the importer to comply with the standards applicable to the vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reliance on Manufacturer's Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the registered importer may rely on the manufacturer's certification for the model to which the motor vehicle involved is substantially similar if the importer certifies that any alteration made by the importer did not affect the compliance of the safety features of the vehicle and the importer keeps records verifying the certification for the period the Secretary of Transportation prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Evidence of Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may require that the certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section be accompanied by evidence of compliance the Secretary considers appropriate or may inspect the certified motor vehicle, or both. If the Secretary gives notice of an inspection, an importer may release the vehicle only after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an inspection showing the motor vehicle complies with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter for which the inspection was made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) release of the vehicle by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall inspect periodically a representative number of motor vehicles for which certifications have been filed under subsection (a)(1) of this section. In carrying out a motor vehicle testing program under this chapter, the Secretary shall include a representative number of motor vehicles for which certifications have been filed under subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Challenging the Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A motor vehicle or bond may not be released under subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary of Transportation, not later than 30 days after receiving a certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section, gives written notice that the Secretary believes or has reason to believe that the certification is false or contains a mispresentation. The vehicle and bond may be released only after the Secretary is satisfied with the certification and any modification of the certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Bond Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A release of a bond required under section 30141(d) of this title is deemed an acceptance of a certification or completion of an inspection under this section but is not a decision by the Secretary of Transportation under section 30118(a) or (b) of this title of compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter.</p>
