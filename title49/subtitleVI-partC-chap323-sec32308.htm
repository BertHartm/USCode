<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may compromise the amount of a civil penalty imposed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining the amount of a penalty or compromise, the appropriateness of the penalty or compromise to the size of the business of the person charged and the gravity of the violation shall be considered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Government may deduct the amount of a civil penalty imposed or compromised under this section from amounts it owes the person liable for the penalty.</p>
