<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;civil action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;proceedings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. begun originally in any court of the United States&rdquo; for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words &ldquo;section 1132, 1134(b) or (f)(1) (related to an aircraft accident), or 1155(a) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the provisions of this chapter&rdquo; in 49 App.:1489 because 49 App.:1489 is taken from 49 App.:ch. 20 and the sections in quotations restate the relevant provisions of 49 App.:ch. 20 carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board. The remaining relevant provisions of 49 App.:ch. 20 are restated in part A of subtitle VII of the revised title, and provisions comparable to this section are included as section 46109 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;rule&rdquo; is omitted as being synonymous with &ldquo;regulation&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;requirement&rdquo; is omitted as included in &ldquo;order&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;or any term, condition, or limitation of any certificate or permit&rdquo; are omitted because the Board does not have authority to issue certificates or permits. The words &ldquo;may be joined as a party or permitted to intervene&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;it shall be lawful to include as parties, or to permit the intervention of&rdquo; for clarity. The text of 49 App.:1489 (words after semicolon) is omitted as surplus.</p>
