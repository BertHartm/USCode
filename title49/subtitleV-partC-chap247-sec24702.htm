B, title II, &sect;217, Oct. 16, 2008, 122 Stat. 4930, provided that: &ldquo;If a State desires to select or selects an entity other than Amtrak to provide services required for the operation of an intercity passenger train route described in section 24102(5)(D) or 24702 of title 49, United States Code, the State may make an agreement with Amtrak to use facilities and equipment of, or have services provided by, Amtrak under terms agreed to by the State and Amtrak to enable the State to utilize an entity other than Amtrak to provide services required for operation of the route.

Compensation shall be determined, as appropriate, in accordance with the methodology established pursuant to section 209 of this division [49 U.S.C. 24101 note], if available.&rdquo;</p>
