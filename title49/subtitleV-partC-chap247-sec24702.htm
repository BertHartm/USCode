<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Plan To Improve Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall continue to carry out its plan, submitted under section 305(f) of the Rail Passenger Service Act, to improve intercity rail passenger transportation provided in the basic system. The plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a zero-based assessment of all operating practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) changes to achieve the minimum use of employees consistent with safe operations and adequate transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a systematic program for achieving the greatest ratio of train size to passenger demand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a systematic program to reduce trip time in the basic system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) establishing training programs to achieve on-time departures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) establishing priorities for passenger trains over freight trains;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) adjusting the buying and pricing of food and beverages so that food and beverage services ultimately will be profitable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) cooperative marketing opportunities between Amtrak and governmental authorities that have intercity rail passenger transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) cooperative marketing campaigns sponsored by Amtrak and the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>State and Local Speed Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify any speed restriction a State or local government imposes on a train of Amtrak that Amtrak decides impedes Amtrak from achieving high-speed intercity rail passenger transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with that State or local government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to evaluate alternatives to the speed restriction, considering the local safety hazard that is the basis for the restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to consider modifying or eliminating the restriction to allow safe operation at higher speeds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>High-Speed Rail Transportation Development</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On reasonable request by a State, political subdivision of a State, regional partnership, private sector representative, or other qualified person, Amtrak shall consult and cooperate to the extent feasible with that person to assist the efforts of that person to achieve high-speed rail transportation through equipment upgrades, grade-crossing safety improvements, and incremental infrastructure improvements on existing rail facilities that Amtrak uses (except the Northeast Corridor facilities). Not later than September 30, 1993, Amtrak shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report on its efforts under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Routes Connecting Corridors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall begin or improve appropriate rail passenger transportation on a route between corridors that Amtrak decides is justified because it will increase ridership on trains of Amtrak on the route and in the connecting corridors.</p>
