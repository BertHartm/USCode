<p class="statutory-body">A carrier issuing a security or assuming an obligation or liability that is void under section 11301 of this title and its directors, officers, attorneys, and other agents who participate in authorizing, issuing, hypothecating, or selling that security, or in authorizing the assumption of that obligation or liability, are jointly and severally liable for the damages sustained by a person who acquires for value, in good faith, and without notice that the issue or assumption is void (1) that security, or (2) a security under which an assumption or liability is void. If a security void under that section is acquired directly from the carrier issuing it, the holder may rescind the transaction and recover the consideration given for the security when it is surrendered to that carrier.</p>
