<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;The Congress declares that&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;accidents and incidents&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; for consistency with the source provisions restated in section 20105(b)(1)(B) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;and to reduce deaths and injuries to persons and to reduce damage to property caused by accidents involving any carrier of hazardous materials&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete because they applied to 49 App.:1761 and 1762, that were repealed by section 113(g) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (Public Law 93&ndash;633, 88 Stat. 2163).</p>
