<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;A carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title&rdquo; <!-- PDFPage:267 -->are added in view of the restatement. The words &ldquo;may publish a tariff filed with the Commission under subchapter IV of this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be published in tariffs or schedules filed in the manner provided in this chapter&rdquo; in view of subchapter IV of chapter 107 of the revised title that governs publication and filing of rates. The words &ldquo;charge or allowance&rdquo; are retained in view of the context. The words &ldquo;shall be no more than is just and reasonable&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of section 10701 of the revised title. See the revision note to section 10101 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;The Commission may prescribe the maximum reasonable charge&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and the Commission may .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. determine what is a reasonable charge as the maximum&rdquo; for clarity and consistency with subchapter I of chapter 107 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;and fix the same by appropriate order&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. The words &ldquo;which order shall have the same force and effect and be enforced in like manner as the orders above provided for under this section&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement. The last sentence is substituted for &ldquo;after hearing on a complaint or on its own initiative&rdquo; for consistency in view of subchapter II of chapter 103 of the revised title and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>
