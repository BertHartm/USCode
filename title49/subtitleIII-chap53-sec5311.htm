<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may make grants for transportation projects that are included in a State program of mass transportation service projects (including service agreements with private providers of mass transportation service) for areas other than urbanized areas. The program shall be submitted annually to the Secretary. The Secretary may approve the program only if the Secretary finds that the program provides a fair distribution of amounts in the State, including Indian reservations, and the maximum feasible coordination of mass transportation service assisted under this section with transportation service assisted by other United States Government sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall carry out a rural transportation assistance program in nonurbanized areas. In carrying out this paragraph, the Secretary may make grants and contracts for transportation research, technical assistance, training, and related support services in nonurbanized areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Apportioning Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall apportion amounts made available under section 5338(a) of this title so that the chief executive officer of each State receives an amount equal to the total amount apportioned multiplied by a ratio equal to the population of areas other than urbanized areas in a State divided by the population of all areas other than urbanized areas in the United States, as shown by the most recent of the following: the latest Government census, the population estimate the Secretary of Commerce prepares after the 4th year after the date the latest cen<!-- PDFPage:117 -->sus is published, or the population estimate the Secretary of Commerce prepares after the 8th year after the date the latest census is published. The amount may be obligated by the chief executive officer for 2 years after the fiscal year in which the amount is apportioned. An amount that is not obligated at the end of that period shall be reapportioned among the States for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Use for Local Transportation Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may use an amount apportioned under this section for a project included in a program under subsection (b) of this section and eligible for assistance under this chapter if the project will provide local transportation service, as defined by the Secretary of Transportation, in an area other than an urbanized area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Use for Administration and Technical Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may allow a State to use not more than 15 percent of the amount apportioned under this section to administer this section and provide technical assistance to a recipient, including project planning, program and management development, coordination of mass transportation programs, and research the State considers appropriate to promote effective delivery of mass transportation to an area other than an urbanized area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in this section, a State carrying out a program of operating assistance under this section may not limit the level or extent of use of the Government grant for the payment of operating expenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Intercity Bus Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State shall expend at least 10 percent of the amount made available in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1993, and 15 percent of the amount made available in each fiscal year after September 30, 1993, to carry out a program to develop and support intercity bus transportation. Eligible activities under the program include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) planning and marketing for intercity bus transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) capital grants for intercity bus shelters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) joint-use stops and depots;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) coordinating rural connections between small mass transportation operations and intercity bus carriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A State does not have to comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection in a fiscal year in which the chief executive officer of the State certifies to the Secretary of Transportation that the intercity bus service needs of the State are being met adequately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Government's Share of Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;amounts of the Government or revenues&rdquo; do not include amounts received under a service agreement with a State or local social service agency or a private social service organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A grant of the Government for a capital project under this section may not be more than 80 percent of the net cost of the project, as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. A grant to pay a subsidy for operating expenses may not be more than 50 percent of the net cost of the operating expense project. At least 50 percent of the remainder shall be provided in cash from sources other than amounts of the Government or revenues from providing mass transportation. Transit system amounts that make up the remainder shall be from an undistributed cash surplus, a replacement or depreciation cash fund or reserve, or new capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Amounts for Operating Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount made available under this section may be used for operating assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Facilities and Equipment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With the consent of the recipient currently having a facility or equipment acquired with assistance under this section, a State may transfer the facility or equipment to any recipient eligible to receive assistance under this chapter if the facility or equipment will continue to be used as required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to Other Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Sections 5323(a)(1)(D) and 5333(b) of this title apply to this section but the Secretary of Labor may waive the application of section 5333(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not affect or discharge a responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation under a law of the United States.</p>
