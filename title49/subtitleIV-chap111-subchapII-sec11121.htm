<p class="note-body">This amends section 11121(a) by adding 49:1(14)(b) to the section.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of subsection (a)(1) and all of subsection (a)(2) restate section 11121(a) of title 49 without change.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the 2d, 3d, and last sentences of subsection (a)(1), the provision added by Public Law 95&ndash;607 is restated. The word &ldquo;decides&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;finds&rdquo; for accuracy. The 3d sentence is substituted for &ldquo;upon the petition of an interested party&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;The Commission may only act after a hearing on the record&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;after notice and hearing on the record&rdquo; for clarity and to omit the reference to &ldquo;notice&rdquo; because it is unnecessary as section 554 of title 5 applies to the proceeding and because of the Due Process clause of the 5th Amendment. The words &ldquo;as required by paragraph (11) of this section&rdquo; are omitted because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;on the evidence presented&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;if the evidence of record&rdquo; for clarity. The word &ldquo;services&rdquo; is omitted as surplus because of the definition of &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title.
