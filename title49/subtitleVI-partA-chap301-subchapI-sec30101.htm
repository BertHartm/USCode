<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Congress hereby declares that&rdquo;, &ldquo;to persons&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Congress determines that&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; before &ldquo;equipment&rdquo; are added for consistency. The words &ldquo;and to expand the national driver register&rdquo; are omitted because section 401 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Public Law 89&ndash;563, 80 Stat. 730), the only section in this law related to the national driver register, was superseded by the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;364, 96 Stat. 1740).</p>
