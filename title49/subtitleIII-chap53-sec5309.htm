<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish new or enhanced coordination between mass transportation and other transportation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) mass transportation projects planned, designed, and carried out to meet the special needs of elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the development of corridors to support fixed guideway systems, including protecting rights of way through acquisition, construction of dedicated bus and high occupancy vehicle lanes and park and ride lots, and other nonvehicular capital improvements that the Secretary may decide would result in increased mass transportation usage in the corridor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Loans for Real Property Interests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may make loans under this section to State and local governmental authorities to acquire interests in real property for use on urban mass transportation systems as rights of way, station sites, and related purposes, including reconstruction, renovation, the net cost of property management, and relocation payments made under section 5324(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may make a loan under paragraph (1) of this subsection for an approved project only after finding that the property reasonably is expected to be required for a mass transportation system and that it will be used for that system within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An applicant for a loan under this subsection shall provide a copy of the application to the planning agency for the community affected by the project at the same time the application is submitted to the Secretary of Transportation. If the planning agency submits comments to the Secretary not later than 30 days after the application is submitted, or, if the agency requests more time within those 30 days, within a period the Secretary establishes, the Secretary shall consider those comments before taking final action on the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A loan agreement under this subsection shall provide that a capital project on the property will be started not later than 10 years after the fiscal year in which the agreement is made. If an interest in property acquired under this subsection is not used for the purpose for which it was acquired, an appraisal of the current value of the property or interest shall be made <!-- PDFPage:110 -->when a decision is made about the use.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not in the preliminary engineering, final design, or construction stage on January 1, 1987.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may approve a grant or loan under this section for a capital project for a new fixed guideway system or extension of an existing fixed guideway system only if the Secretary decides that the proposed project is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) based on the results of an alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) justified based on a comprehensive review of its mobility improvements, environmental benefits, cost effectiveness, and operating efficiencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment, including evidence of stable and dependable financing sources to construct, maintain, and operate the system or extension.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making a decision under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the direct and indirect costs of relevant alternatives;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The simultaneous evaluation of projects in at least 2 corridors in a metropolitan area may not be limited and the Secretary of Transportation shall make decisions under this subsection with expedited procedures that will promote carrying out an approved State Implementation Plan in a timely way if a project is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) located in a nonattainment area that is not an extreme or severe nonattainment area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a transportation control measure (as defined by the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) required to carry out the State Implementation Plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) This subsection does not apply to a part of a project (including a commuter rail transportation project on an existing right of way) financed completely with amounts for highways made available under part A of title I of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 1915).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A project financed under this subsection shall be carried out through a full financing grant agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Required Payments and Eligible Costs of Projects That Enhance Urban Economic Development or Incorporate Private Investment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each grant or loan under subsection (a)(5) of this section shall require that a person making an agreement to occupy space in a facility pay a reasonable share of the costs of the facility through rental payments and other means.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Letters of Intent, Full Financing Grant Agreements, and Early Systems Work Agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may issue a letter of intent to an applicant announcing an intention to obligate, for a project under this section, an amount from future available budget authority specified in law that is not more than the amount stipulated as the financial participation of the Secretary in the project. The amount shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment when a letter is issued for a fixed guideway project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least 30 days before issuing a letter under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify in writing the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate of the proposed issuance of the letter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The issuance of a letter is deemed not to be an obligation under sections 1108(c) and (d), 1501, and 1502(a) of title 31 or an administrative commitment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only when amounts are appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may make a full financing grant agreement with an applicant. The agreement shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) establish the terms of participation by the United States Government in a project under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) establish the maximum amount of Government financial assistance for the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) cover the period of time for completing the project, including a period extending beyond the period of an authorization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) make timely and efficient management of the project easier according to the law of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and may include a commitment, contingent on amounts to be specified in law in advance for commitments under this paragraph, to obligate an additional amount from future available budget authority specified in law. The agreement shall state that the contingent commitment is not an obligation of the Government. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out a part of the project within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the project under a full financing grant agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. The amount stipulated in an agreement under this paragraph for a fixed guideway project shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may make an early systems work agreement with an applicant if a record of decision under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) has been issued on the project and the Secretary finds there is reason to believe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a full financing grant agreement for the project will be made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the terms of the work agreement will promote ultimate completion of the project more rapidly and at less cost.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A work agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and shall provide for reimbursement of preliminary costs of carrying out the project, including land acquisition, timely procurement of system elements for which specifications are decided, and other activities the Secretary of Transportation decides are appropriate to make efficient, long-term project management easier. A work agreement shall cover the period of time the Secretary considers appropriate. The period may extend beyond the period of current authorization. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out the work agreement within a reasonable time are a <!-- PDFPage:112 -->cost of carrying out the agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. If an applicant does not carry out the project for reasons within the control of the applicant, the applicant shall repay all Government payments made under the work agreement plus reasonable interest and penalty charges the Secretary establishes in the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total estimated amount of future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments to incur obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent, full financing grant agreements, and early systems work agreements may be not more than the greater of the amount authorized under section 5338(a) of this title to carry out this section or 50 percent of the uncommitted cash balance remaining in the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund (including amounts received from taxes and interest earned that are more than amounts previously obligated), less an amount the Secretary of Transportation reasonably estimates is necessary for grants under this section not covered by a letter. The total amount covered by new letters and contingent commitments included in full financing grant agreements and early systems work agreements may be not more than a limitation specified in law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Government's Share of Net Project Cost</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Based on engineering studies, studies of economic feasibility, and information on the expected use of equipment or facilities, the Secretary of Transportation shall estimate the net project cost. A grant for the project is for 80 percent of the net project cost, unless the grant recipient requests a lower grant percentage. The remainder shall be provided in cash from a source other than amounts of the Government. Transit system amounts that make up the remainder must be from an undistributed cash surplus, a replacement or depreciation cash fund or reserve, or new capital. The remainder for a planned extension to a fixed guideway system may include the cost of rolling stock previously purchased if the applicant satisfies the Secretary that only amounts other than amounts of the Government were used and that the purchase was made for use on the extension. A refund or reduction of the remainder may be made only if a refund of a proportional amount of the grant of the Government is made at the same time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Loan Term Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except for a loan under subsection (b) of this section, a loan, including a renewal or extension of the loan, may be made, and a security or obligation may be bought, only if it has a maturity date of not more than 40 years. Interest on a loan may not be less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a rate the Secretary of the Treasury establishes, considering the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the Government that have remaining periods of maturity comparable to the average maturity of the loan, adjusted to the nearest .125 percent; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an allowance the Secretary of Transportation considers adequate to cover administrative costs and probable losses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Loan Payment Forgiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A grant agreement for a capital project may forgive repaying the loan and interest in place of a cash grant for the amount forgiven. The amount is part of the grant and part of the contribution of the Government to the cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Making Loans and Grants for Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may not make a loan under this section for a project for which a grant (except a relocation payment grant) is made under this section. However, the Secretary may make a project grant even though real property for the project has been or will be acquired through a loan under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l) </em><cap-smallcap>Fiscal Capacity Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Transportation gives priority consideration to financing projects that include more than the non-Government share required under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary shall give equal consideration to differences in the fiscal capacity of State and local governments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Allocating Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Of the amounts available for grants and loans under this section for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1993&ndash;1997&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 40 percent is available for fixed guideway modernization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 40 percent is available for capital projects for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 20 percent is available to replace, rehabilitate, and buy buses and related equipment and to construct bus-related facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At least 5.5 percent of the amounts available in each fiscal year under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection is available for areas other than urbanized areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not later than January 20 of each year, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit to the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a proposal on the allocation of amounts to be made available to finance grants and loans for capital projects for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems among applicants for those amounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A person applying for, or receiving, assistance for a project described in clause (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection may receive assistance for a project described in another of those clauses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) <cap-smallcap>Undertaking Projects in Advance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may pay the Government's share of the net project cost to a State or local governmental authority that carries out any part of a project described in this section or a substitute transit project described in section 103(e)(4) of title 23 without the aid of amounts of the Government and according to all applicable procedures and requirements if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State or local governmental authority applies for the payment;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:113 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary approves the payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) before carrying out the part of the project, the Secretary approves the plans and specifications for the part in the same way as other projects under this section or section 103(e)(4) of title 23.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The cost of carrying out part of a project includes the amount of interest earned and payable on bonds issued by the State or local governmental authority to the extent proceeds of the bonds are expended in carrying out the part. However, the amount of interest under this paragraph may not be more than the most favorable interest terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financial terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Transportation shall consider changes in capital project cost indices when determining the estimated cost under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o) </em><cap-smallcap>Use of Deobligated Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount available under this section that is deobligated may be used for any purpose under this section.</p>
