<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Previously issued letter of intent or full funding grant agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not apply to projects for which the Secretary has issued a letter of intent or entered into a full funding grant agreement before the date of enactment of the Federal Transit Act of 1998.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) [Reserved.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Letters of Intent, Full Funding Grant Agreements, and Early Systems Work Agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may issue a letter of intent to an applicant announcing an intention to obligate, for a project under this section, an amount from future available budget authority specified in law that is not more than the amount stipulated as the financial participation of the Secretary in the project. The amount shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment when a letter is issued for a fixed guideway project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least 60 days before issuing a letter under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or entering into a full funding grant agreement, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify in writing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate of the proposed letter or agreement. The Secretary shall include with the notification a copy of the proposed letter or agreement as well as the evaluations and ratings for the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The issuance of a letter is deemed not to be an obligation under sections 1108(c) and (d), 1501, and 1502(a) of title 31 or an administrative commitment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only when amounts are appropriated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) make timely and efficient management of the project easier according to the law of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and may include a commitment, contingent on amounts to be specified in law in advance for commitments under this paragraph, to obligate an additional amount from future available budget authority specified in law. The agreement shall state that the contingent commitment is not an obligation of the Government. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out a part of the project within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the project under a full funding grant agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. The amount stipulated in an agreement under this paragraph for a fixed guideway project shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may make an early systems work agreement with an applicant if a record of decision under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) has been issued on the project and the Secretary finds there is reason to believe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a full funding grant agreement for the project will be made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the terms of the work agreement will promote ultimate completion of the project more rapidly and at less cost.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A work agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and shall provide for reimbursement of preliminary costs of carrying out the project, including land acquisition, timely procurement of system elements for which specifications are decided, and other activities the Secretary of Transportation decides are appropriate to make efficient, long-term project management easier. A work agreement shall cover the period of time the Secretary considers appropriate. The period may extend beyond the period of current authorization. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out the work agreement within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. If an applicant does not carry out the project for reasons within the control of the applicant, the applicant shall repay all Government payments made under the work agreement plus reasonable interest and penalty charges the Secretary establishes in the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total estimated amount of future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments to incur obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent, full funding grant agreements, and early systems work agreements may be not more than the greater of the amount authorized under section 5338(b) of this title for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems and the amount appropriated under section 5338(h)(5) or an amount equivalent to the last 2 fiscal years of funding authorized under section 5338(b) for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems, less an amount the Secretary of Transportation reasonably estimates is necessary for grants under this section not covered by a letter. The total amount covered by new letters and contingent commitments included in full funding grant agreements and early systems work agreements may be not more than a limitation specified in law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Government's Share of Net Project Cost</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Based on engineering studies, studies of economic feasibility, and information on the expected use of equipment or facilities, the Secretary of Transportation shall estimate the net project cost. A grant for the project is for 80 percent of the net project cost, unless the grant recipient requests a lower grant percentage. The remainder shall be provided in cash from a source other than amounts of the Government. Transit system amounts that make up the remainder must be from an undistributed cash surplus, a replacement or depreciation cash fund or reserve, or new capital. The remainder for a planned extension to a fixed guideway system may include the cost of rolling stock previously purchased if the applicant satisfies the Secretary that only amounts other than amounts of the Government were used and that the purchase was made for use on the extension. A refund or reduction of the remainder may be made only if a refund of a proportional amount of the grant of the Government is made at the same time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Loan Term Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except for a loan under subsection (b) of this section, a loan, including a renewal or extension of the loan, may be made, and a security or obligation may be bought, only if it has a maturity date of not more than 40 years. Interest on a loan may not be less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a rate the Secretary of the Treasury establishes, considering the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the Government that have remaining periods of maturity comparable to the average maturity of the loan, adjusted to the nearest .125 percent; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an allowance the Secretary of Transportation considers adequate to cover administrative costs and probable losses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Loan Payment Forgiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A grant agreement for a capital project may forgive repaying the loan and interest in place of a cash grant for the amount forgiven. The amount is part of the grant and part of the contribution of the Government to the cost of the project.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:141 --><p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Making Loans and Grants for Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may not make a loan under this section for a project for which a grant (except a relocation payment grant) is made under this section. However, the Secretary may make a project grant even though real property for the project has been or will be acquired through a loan under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) <cap-smallcap>Fiscal Capacity Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Transportation gives priority consideration to financing projects that include more than the non-Government share required under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary shall give equal consideration to differences in the fiscal capacity of State and local governments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Allocating Amounts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Of the amounts made available by or appropriated under section 5338(b) for grants and loans under this section for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2003&mdash;</p>
