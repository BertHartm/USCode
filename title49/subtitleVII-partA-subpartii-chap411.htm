<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41104. Additional limitations and requirements of charter air carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe a regulation or issue an order restricting the marketability, flexibility, accessibility, or variety of charter air transportation provided under a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title only to the extent required by the public interest. A regulation prescribed or order issued under this subsection may not be more restrictive than a regulation related to charter air transportation that was in effect on October 1, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Scheduled Operations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), an air carrier, including an indirect air carrier, may not provide, in aircraft designed for more than 9 passenger seats, regularly scheduled charter air transportation, for which the public is provided in advance a schedule containing the departure location, departure time, and arrival location of the flight, to or from an airport that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) does not have an airport operating certificate issued under part 139 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (or any subsequent similar regulation); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has an airport operating certificate issued under part 139 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (or any subsequent similar regulation) if the airport&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is a reliever airport (as defined in section 47102) and is designated as such in the national plan of integrated airports maintained under section 47103; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is located within 20 nautical miles (22 statute miles) of 3 or more airports that each annually account for at least 1 percent of the total United States passenger enplanements and at least 2 of which are operated by the sponsor of the reliever airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;regularly scheduled charter air transportation&rdquo; does not include operations for which the departure time, departure location, and arrival location are specifically negotiated with the customer or the customer's representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not apply to any airport in the State of Alaska or to any airport outside the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Waivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may waive the application of paragraph (1)(B) in cases in which the Secretary determines that the public interest so requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier holding a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title may provide charter air transportation between places in Alaska only to the extent the Secretary decides the transportation is required by public convenience and necessity. The Secretary may make that decision when issuing, amending, or modifying the certificate. This subsection does not apply to a certificate issued under section 41102 to a citizen of the United States who, before July 1, 1977&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintained a principal place of business in Alaska; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conducted air transport operations between places in Alaska with aircraft with a <!-- PDFPage:643 -->certificate for gross takeoff weight of more than 40,000 pounds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Suspensions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall suspend for not more than 30 days any part of the certificate of a charter air carrier if the Secretary decides that the failure of the carrier to comply with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title, or a regulation or order of the Secretary under section 41110(e) or 41112, requires immediate suspension in the interest of the rights, welfare, or safety of the public. The Secretary may act under this paragraph without notice or a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall begin immediately a hearing to decide if the certificate referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection should be amended, modified, suspended, or revoked. Until the hearing is completed, the Secretary may suspend the certificate for additional periods totaling not more than 60 days. If the Secretary decides that the carrier is complying with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title and regulations and orders under sections 41110(e) and 41112, the Secretary immediately may end the suspension period and proceeding begun under this subsection. However, the Secretary is not prevented from imposing a civil penalty on the carrier for violating the requirements described in section 41110(e) or 41112 or a regulation or order under section 41110(e) or 41112.</p>

The policy or plan must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the insurance, for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual or for loss of, or damage to, property of others, resulting from the operation or maintenance of the aircraft under the certificate.

The bond or security must be sufficient to ensure the carrier adequately will pay the passengers and shippers when the transportation the carrier agrees to provide is not provided. The Secretary shall prescribe the amounts to be paid under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) At a minimum, the written notice shall advise an owner (i) to contact the insurer of the property as the authoritative source for information about coverage and compensation; (ii) to not rely on unofficial information offered by air carrier representatives about compensation by the air carrier for accident-site property damage; and (iii) to obtain photographic or other detailed evidence of property damage as soon as possible after the accident, consistent with restrictions on access to the accident site.</p>
