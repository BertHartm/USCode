<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe motor vehicle <!-- PDFPage:533 -->safety standards. Each standard shall be practicable, meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and be stated in objective terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Considerations and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a motor vehicle safety standard under this chapter, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider relevant available motor vehicle safety information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with the agency established under the Act of August 20, 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;684, 72 Stat. 635), and other appropriate State or interstate authorities (including legislative committees);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider whether a proposed standard is reasonable, practicable, and appropriate for the particular type of motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment for which it is prescribed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the extent to which the standard will carry out section 30101 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may advise, assist, and cooperate with departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government, States, and other public and private agencies in developing motor vehicle safety standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effective Dates of Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall specify the effective date of a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter in the order prescribing the standard. A standard may not become effective before the 180th day after the standard is prescribed or later than one year after it is prescribed. However, the Secretary may prescribe a different effective date after finding, for good cause shown, that a different effective date is in the public interest and publishing the reasons for the finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) 5-<cap-smallcap>Year Plan for Testing Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish and periodically review and update on a continuing basis a 5-year plan for testing motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter that the Secretary considers capable of being tested. In developing the plan and establishing testing priorities, the Secretary shall consider factors the Secretary considers appropriate, consistent with section 30101 of this title and the Secretary's other duties and powers under this chapter. The Secretary may change at any time those priorities to address matters the Secretary considers of greater priority. The initial plan may be the 5-year plan for compliance testing in effect on December 18, 1991.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;low-emission motor vehicle&rdquo; means a motor vehicle meeting the standards for new motor vehicles applicable to the vehicle under section 202 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521) when the vehicle is manufactured and emitting an air pollutant in an amount significantly below one of those standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Exempt and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may exempt, on a temporary basis, motor vehicles from a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter or passenger motor vehicles from a bumper standard prescribed under chapter 325 of this title, on terms the Secretary considers appropriate. An exemption may be renewed. A renewal may be granted only on reapplication and must conform to the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may begin a proceeding under this subsection when a manufacturer applies for an exemption or a renewal of an exemption. The Secretary shall publish notice of the application and provide an opportunity to comment. An application for an exemption or for a renewal of an exemption shall be filed at a time and in the way, and contain information, this section and the Secretary require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may act under this subsection on finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an exemption is consistent with the public interest and this chapter or chapter 325 of this title (as applicable); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) compliance with the standard would cause substantial economic hardship to a manufacturer that has tried to comply with the standard in good faith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the exemption would make easier the development or field evaluation of a new motor vehicle safety feature providing a safety level at least equal to the safety level of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the exemption would make the development or field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle easier and would not unreasonably lower the safety level of that vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) compliance with the standard would prevent the manufacturer from selling a motor vehicle with an overall safety level at least equal to the overall safety level of nonexempt vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contents of Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer applying for an exemption under subsection (b) of this section shall include the following information in the application:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section, a complete financial statement describing the economic hardship and a complete description of the manufacturer's good faith effort to comply with each motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter, or a bumper standard prescribed under chapter 325 of this title, from which the manufacturer is requesting an exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii) of this section, a record of the research, development, and testing establishing the innovative nature of the safety feature and a detailed analysis establishing that the safety level of the feature at least equals the safety level of the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(iii) of this section, a record of the research, development, and testing establishing that the motor vehicle is a low-emission motor vehicle and that the safety level of the vehicle is not lowered unreasonably by exemption from the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(iv) of this section, a detailed analysis showing how the vehicle provides an overall safety level at least equal to the overall safety level of nonexempt vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer is eligible for an exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section (including an exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) relating to a bumper standard referred to in subsection (b)(1)) only if the Secretary determines that the manufacturer's total motor vehicle production in the most recent year of production is not more than 10,000. A manufacturer is eligible for an exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section only if the Secretary determines the exemption is for not more than 2,500 vehicles to be sold in the United States in any 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An exemption or renewal under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section may be granted for not more than 3 years. An exemption or renewal under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may be granted for not more than 2 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may make public, by the 10th day after an application is filed, information contained in the application or relevant to the application unless the information concerns or is related to a trade secret or other confidential information not relevant to the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Notice of Decision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of each decision granting an exemption under this section and the reasons for granting it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Permanent Label Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require a permanent label to be fixed to a motor vehicle granted an exemption under this section. The label shall either name or describe each motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter or bumper standard prescribed under chapter 325 of this title <!-- PDFPage:537 -->from which the vehicle is exempt. The Secretary may require that written notice of an exemption be delivered by appropriate means to the dealer and the first purchaser of the vehicle other than for resale.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Providing Information and Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may require that each manufacturer of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment provide technical information related to performance and safety required to carry out this chapter. The Secretary may require the manufacturer to give the following notice of that information when the Secretary decides it is necessary:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to each prospective purchaser of a vehicle or equipment before the first sale other than for resale at each location at which the vehicle or equipment is offered for sale by a person having a legal relationship with the manufacturer, in a way the Secretary decides is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the first purchaser of a vehicle or equipment other than for resale when the vehicle or equipment is bought, in printed matter placed in the vehicle or attached to or accompanying the equipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Maintaining Purchaser Records and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer of a motor vehicle or tire (except a retreaded tire) shall cause to be maintained a record of the name and address of the first purchaser of each vehicle or tire it produces and, to the extent prescribed by regulations of the Secretary, shall cause to be maintained a record of the name and address of the first purchaser of replacement equipment (except a tire) that the manufacturer produces. The Secretary may prescribe by regulation the records to be maintained and reasonable procedures for maintaining the records under this subsection, including procedures to be followed by distributors and dealers to assist the manufacturer in obtaining the information required by this subsection. A procedure shall be reasonable for the type of vehicle or tire involved, and shall provide reasonable assurance that a customer list of a distributor or dealer, or similar information, will be made available to a person (except the distributor or dealer) only when necessary to carry out this subsection and sections 30118&ndash;30121, 30166(f), and 30167(a) and (b) of this title. Availability of assistance from a distributor or dealer does not affect an obligation of a manufacturer under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Secretary may require a distributor or dealer to maintain a record under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the business of the distributor or dealer is owned or controlled by a manufacturer of tires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall require each distributor and dealer whose business is not owned or controlled by a manufacturer of tires to give a registration form (containing the tire identification number) to the first purchaser of a tire. The Secretary shall prescribe the form, which shall be standardized for all tires and designed to allow the purchaser to complete and return it directly to the manufacturer of the tire. The manufacturer shall give sufficient copies of forms to distributors and dealers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall evaluate from time to time how successful the procedures under paragraph (2) of this subsection have been in helping to maintain records about first purchasers of tires. After each evaluation, the Secretary shall decide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the extent to which distributors and dealers have complied with the procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have encouraged first purchasers of tires to register the tires; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may prescribe a requirement under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only if the Secretary decides it is necessary to reduce the risk to motor vehicle safety, after considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the cost of the requirement to manufacturers and the burden of the requirement on distributors and dealers, compared to the increase in the percentage of first purchasers of tires about whom records would be maintained as a result of the requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have complied with the procedures in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have encouraged first purchasers of tires to register the tires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A manufacturer of tires shall reimburse distributors and dealers of that manufacturer's tires for all reasonable costs incurred by the distributors and dealers in complying with a requirement prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) After making a decision under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall submit to each House of Congress a report containing a detailed statement of the decision and an explanation of the reasons for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rollover Tests.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Development</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 2 years from the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) develop a dynamic test on rollovers by motor vehicles for the purposes of a consumer information program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) carry out a program of conducting such tests.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Test results</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As the Secretary develops a test under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary shall conduct a rulemaking to determine how best to disseminate test results to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Motor vehicles covered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection applies to motor vehicles, including passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks, with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) other information the Secretary prescribes by regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Earliest Remedy Date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The date specified by a manufacturer in a notification under subsection (a)(5) of this section or section 30121(c)(2) of this title is the earliest date that parts and facilities reasonably can be expected to be available to remedy the defect or noncompliance. The Secretary may disapprove the date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prescribed by the Secretary, after the manufacturer receives notice of a final decision under section 30118(b) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after the manufacturer first decides that a safety-related defect or noncompliance exists under section 30118(c) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Means of Providing Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Notification required under section 30118 of this title about a motor vehicle shall be sent by first class mail&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;30120. Remedies for defects and noncompliance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Ways To Remedy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, when notification of a defect or noncompliance is required under section 30118(b) or (c) of this title, the manufacturer of the defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment shall remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge when the vehicle or equipment is presented for remedy. Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the manufacturer shall remedy the defect or noncompliance in any of the following ways the manufacturer chooses:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if a vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by repairing the vehicle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) by replacing the vehicle with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) by refunding the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if replacement equipment, by repairing the equipment or replacing the equipment with identical or reasonably equivalent equipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations to allow the manufacturer to impose conditions on the replacement of a motor vehicle or refund of its price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Tire Remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer of a tire, including an original equipment tire, shall remedy a defective or noncomplying tire if the owner or purchaser presents the tire for remedy not later than 60 days after the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the day the owner or purchaser receives notification under section 30119 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the manufacturer decides to replace the tire, the day the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement is available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the manufacturer decides to replace the tire and the replacement is not available during the 60-day period, the owner or purchaser must present the tire for remedy during a subsequent 60-day period that begins only after the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement will be available during the subsequent period. If tires are available during the subsequent period, only a tire presented for remedy during that period must be remedied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Adequacy of Repairs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a manufacturer decides to repair a defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment and the repair is not done adequately within a reasonable time, the manufacturer shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:544 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) replace the vehicle or equipment without charge with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle or equipment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for a vehicle, refund the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Failure to repair a motor vehicle or replacement equipment adequately not later than 60 days after its presentation is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. However, the Secretary may extend, by order, the 60-day period if good cause for an extension is shown and the reason is published in the Federal Register before the period ends. Presentation of a vehicle or equipment for repair before the date specified by a manufacturer in a notice under section 30119(a)(5) or 30121(c)(2) of this title is not a presentation under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines that a manufacturer's remedy program is not likely to be capable of completion within a reasonable time, the Secretary may require the manufacturer to accelerate the remedy program if the Secretary finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that there is a risk of serious injury or death if the remedy program is not accelerated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that acceleration of the remedy program can be reasonably achieved by expanding the sources of replacement parts, expanding the number of authorized repair facilities, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Filing Manufacturer's Remedy Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer shall file with the Secretary a copy of the manufacturer's program under this section for remedying a defect or noncompliance. The Secretary shall make the program available to the public and publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register. A manufacturer's remedy program shall include a plan for reimbursing an owner or purchaser who incurred the cost of the remedy within a reasonable time in advance of the manufacturer's notification under subsection (b) or (c) of section 30118. The Secretary may prescribe regulations establishing what constitutes a reasonable time for purposes of the preceding sentence and other reasonable conditions for the reimbursement plan. In the case of a remedy program involving the replacement of tires, the manufacturer shall include a plan addressing how to prevent, to the extent reasonably within the control of the manufacturer, replaced tires from being resold for installation on a motor vehicle, and how to limit, to the extent reasonably within the control of the manufacturer, the disposal of replaced tires in landfills, particularly through shredding, crumbling, recycling, recovery, and other alternative beneficial non-vehicular uses. The manufacturer shall include information about the implementation of such plan with each quarterly report to the Secretary regarding the progress of any notification or remedy campaigns.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Hearings About Meeting Remedy Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the motion of the Secretary or on application by any interested person, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the remedy requirements under this section. Any interested person may make written and oral presentations of information, views, and arguments on whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the remedy requirements. If the Secretary decides a manufacturer has not reasonably met the remedy requirements, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer to take specified action to meet those requirements and may take any other action authorized under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Fair Reimbursement to Dealers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer shall pay fair reimbursement to a dealer providing a remedy without charge under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The requirement that a remedy be provided without charge does not apply if the motor vehicle or replacement equipment was bought by the first purchaser more than 10 calendar years, or the tire, including an original equipment tire, was bought by the first purchaser more than 5 calendar years, before notice is given under section 30118(c) of this title or an order is issued under section 30118(b) of this title, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not apply during any period in which enforcement of an order under section 30118(b) of this title is restrained or the order is set aside in a civil action to which section 30121(d) of this title applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary shall exempt the manufacturer from this section if the Secretary decides a defect or noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. The Secretary may take action under this subsection only after notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for any interested person to present information, views, and arguments.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Provisional Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may order a manufacturer to issue a provisional notification if a civil action about an order issued under section 30118(b) of this title has been brought under section 30163 of this title. The provisional notification shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement that the Secretary has decided that a defect related to motor vehicle safety or noncompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter exists and that the manufacturer is contesting the decision in a civil action in a United States district court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a clear description of the Secretary's stated basis for the decision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary's evaluation of the risk to motor vehicle safety reasonably related to the defect or noncompliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) measures the Secretary considers necessary to avoid an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety resulting from the defect or noncompliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a statement that the manufacturer will remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge under section 30120 of this title, but that the requirement to remedy without charge is conditioned on the outcome of the civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) other information the Secretary prescribes by regulation or includes in the order requiring the notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A notification under this subsection does not relieve a manufacturer of liability for not giving notification required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions for Not Notifying</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer that does not notify owners and purchasers under section 30119(c) and (d) of this title is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty, unless the manufacturer prevails in a civil action referred to in subsection (a) of this section or the court in that action enjoins enforcement of the order. Enforcement may be enjoined only if the court decides that the failure to notify is reasonable and that the manufacturer has demonstrated the likelihood of prevailing on the merits. If enforcement is enjoined, the manufacturer is not liable during the time the order is stayed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A manufacturer that does not notify owners and purchasers as required under subsection (a) of this section is liable for a civil penalty regardless of whether the manufacturer prevails in an action on the validity of the order issued under section 30118(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Orders to Manufacturers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary prevails in a civil action referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to notify each owner, purchaser, and dealer described in section 30119(d) of this title of the outcome of the action and other information the Secretary requires, and notification under this clause may be combined with notification required under section 30118(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to specify the earliest date under section 30119(b) of this title on which the defect or noncompliance will be remedied without charge under section 30120 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if notification was required under subsection (a) of this section, to reimburse an owner or purchaser for reasonable and necessary expenses (in an amount that is not more than the amount specified in the order of the Secretary under subsection (a)) incurred for repairing the defect or noncompliance during the period beginning on the date that notification was required to be issued and ending on the date the owner or purchaser receives the notification under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 30163(c) of this title, a civil action about an order issued under section 30118(b) of this title must be brought in the United States district court for a judicial district in the State in which the manufacturer is incorporated or the District of Columbia. On motion of a party, the court may transfer the action to another district court if good cause is shown. All actions related to the same order under section 30118(b) shall be consolidated in an action in one judicial district under an order of the court in which the first action was brought. If the first action is transferred to another court, that court shall issue the consolidation order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inflatable Restraint Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than September 1, 1993, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe under this chapter an amendment to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 issued under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. The amendment shall require that the automatic occupant crash protection system for both of the front outboard seating positions for each of the following vehicles be an inflatable restraint (with lap and shoulder belts) complying with the occupant protection requirements under section 4.1.2.1 of Standard 208:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 95 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of passenger cars manufactured after August 31, 1996, and before September 1, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 80 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks (except walk-in van-type trucks and vehicles designed to be sold only to the United States Postal Service) with a gross vehicle weight rating of not more than 8,500 pounds and an unloaded vehicle weight of not more than 5,500 pounds manufactured after August 31, 1997, and before September 1, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 100 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of passenger cars manufactured after August 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 100 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of vehicles described in clause (B) of this paragraph manufactured after August 31, 1998.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Manufacturers may not use credits and incentives available before September 1, 1998, under the provisions of Standard 208 (as amended by this section) to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection after August 31, 1998.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:550 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Owner Manual Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In amending Standard 208, the Secretary of Transportation shall require, to be effective as soon as possible after the amendment is prescribed, that owner manuals for passenger cars, buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks equipped with an inflatable restraint include a statement in an easily understandable format stating that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) either or both of the front outboard seating positions of the vehicle are equipped with an inflatable restraint referred to as an &ldquo;airbag&rdquo; and a lap and shoulder belt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the &ldquo;airbag&rdquo; is a supplemental restraint and is not a substitute for lap and shoulder belts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) lap and shoulder belts also must be used correctly by an occupant in a front outboard seating position to provide restraint or protection from frontal crashes as well as other types of crashes or accidents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) occupants should always wear their lap and shoulder belts, if available, or other safety belts, whether or not there is an inflatable restraint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Seat Belt Use Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that it is in the public interest for each State to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use laws and for the United States Government to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Temporary Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary of Transportation may exempt, on a temporary basis, motor vehicles of that manufacturer from any requirement under subsections (b) and (c) of this section on terms the Secretary considers appropriate. An exemption may be renewed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may grant an exemption under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the Secretary finds that there has been a disruption in the supply of any component of an inflatable restraint or in the use and installation of that component by the manufacturer because of an unavoidable event not under the control of the manufacturer that will prevent the manufacturer from meeting its anticipated production volume of vehicles with those restraints.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Only an affected manufacturer may apply for an exemption. The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe in the amendment to Standard 208 required under this section the information an affected manufacturer must include in its application under this subsection. The manufacturer shall specify in the application the models, lines, and types of vehicles affected. The Secretary may consolidate similar applications from different manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An exemption or renewal of an exemption is conditioned on the commitment of the manufacturer to recall the exempted vehicles for installation of the omitted inflatable restraints within a reasonable time that the manufacturer proposes and the Secretary of Transportation approves after the components become available in sufficient quantities to satisfy both anticipated production and recall volume requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of Transportation shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of each application under this subsection and each decision to grant or deny a temporary exemption and the reasons for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary of Transportation shall require a label for each exempted vehicle that can be removed only after recall and installation of the required inflatable restraint. The Secretary shall require that written notice of the exemption be provided to the dealer and the first purchaser of each exempted vehicle other than for resale, with the notice being provided in a way, and containing the information, the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) This section revises, but does not replace, Standard 208 as in effect on December 18, 1991, including the amendment of March 26, 1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 12472), to Standard 208, extending the requirements for automatic crash protection, with incentives for more innovative automatic crash protection, to trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles. This section may not be construed as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) affecting another provision of law carried out by the Secretary of Transportation applicable to passenger cars, buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, or trucks; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establishing a precedent related to developing or prescribing a Government motor vehicle safety standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section and amendments to Standard 208 made under this section may not be construed as indicating an intention by Congress to affect any liability of a motor vehicle manufacturer under applicable law related to vehicles with or without inflatable restraints.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On October 1, 1992, and annually after that date through October 1, 2000, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit reports on the effectiveness of occupant restraint systems expressed as a percentage reduction in fatalities or injuries of restrained occupants compared to unrestrained occupants for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a combination of inflated restraints and lap and shoulder belts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inflated restraints only; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) lap and shoulder belts only.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Defense, the Secretary of Transportation also shall provide information and analysis on lap and shoulder belt use, nationally and in each State by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) military personnel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Government, State, and local law enforcement officers;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is the policy of the Department of Transportation that all child occupants of motor vehicles, regardless of seating position, be appropriately restrained in order to reduce the incidence of injuries and fatalities resulting from motor vehicle crashes on the streets, roads, and highways.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Research has shown that very few children between the ages of 4 to 8 years old are in the appropriate restraint for their age when riding in passenger motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Children who have outgrown their child safety seats should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat until an adult seat belt fits properly.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Children who were properly restrained when riding in passenger motor vehicles suffered less severe injuries from accidents than children not properly restrained.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF SAFETY OF CHILD RESTRAINTS IN PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation (hereafter referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary&rsquo;) shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish performance requirements for child restraints, including booster seats, for the restraint of children weighing more than 50 pounds.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) consider whether to establish performance requirements for seat belt fit when used with booster seats and other belt guidance devices;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) consider whether to address situations where children weighing more than 50 pounds only have access to seating positions with lap belts, such as allowing tethered child restraints for such children; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) review the definition of the term &lsquo;booster seat&rsquo; in Federal motor vehicle safety standard No. 213 under section 571.213 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, to determine if it is sufficiently comprehensive.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Completion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall complete the rulemaking proceeding required by subsection (a) not <!-- PDFPage:552 -->later than 30 months after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 4, 2002].</p>
