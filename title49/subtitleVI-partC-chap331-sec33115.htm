<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When practicable, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall notify a person against whom an action under this subsection is planned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall give the person an opportunity to present that person's views; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) except for a knowing and willful violation, shall give the person a reasonable opportunity to comply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:539 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The failure of the Secretary to comply with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph does not prevent a court from granting appropriate relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Jury Trial Demand</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a trial for criminal contempt for violating an injunction or restraining order issued under subsection (c) of this section, the violation of which is also a violation of this chapter, the defendant may demand a jury trial.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil action under subsection (a) or (c) of this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the violation occurred or the defendant resides, is found, or transacts business.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;section 33114(a)(1)&ndash;(4)&rdquo; are used to correct an erroneous cross-reference in section 611(a)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92&ndash;513, 86 Stat. 947) to section 607 of that Act. Sections 607 and 611 were redesignated by section 306(a) of the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&ndash;519, 106 Stat. 3397). The words &ldquo;is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may be assessed a civil penalty&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the word &ldquo;imposes&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;assessed&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;the appropriateness of such penalty to&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(5), the words &ldquo;United States district court&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;The Attorney General may bring a civil action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words &ldquo;on behalf of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;shall have jurisdiction&rdquo; are omitted because of 28:1331. The words &ldquo;for cause shown and subject to the provisions of rule 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because the rules apply in the absence of an exception from them. The word &ldquo;enjoin&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;restrain&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;the defendant may demand a jury trial&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;trial shall be by the court, or, upon demand of the accused, by a jury&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title.</p>
