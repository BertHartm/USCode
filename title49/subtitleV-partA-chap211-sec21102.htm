<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;with respect to one or more of its employees&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because the authority to exempt a railroad carrier includes the authority to exempt only some of the employees of the carrier. The words &ldquo;carrier to require or allow its employees to be on duty&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any railroad described in this section to work its employees&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in this chapter.</p>
