<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;fined under title 18&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $5,000&rdquo; and &ldquo;fined not less than $100, nor more than $5,000&rdquo; for consistency with title 18. The words &ldquo;for each offense&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;fares, or charges&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of the definition of &ldquo;rate&rdquo; in section 40102(a) of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by 18:3559. The words &ldquo;and, upon conviction thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;device or&rdquo; and &ldquo;suffer or&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;by any means&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in any manner or by any device&rdquo; for consistency in this section and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clauses (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; is added for clarity because only foreign air transportation has regulated prices. In clause (1), the word &ldquo;rebate&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;refund or remittance&rdquo; for consistency in this section. In clause (2), the word &ldquo;favor&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;.</p>
