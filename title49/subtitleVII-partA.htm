<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assigning and maintaining safety as the highest priority in air commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) before authorizing new air transportation services, evaluating the safety implications of those services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) preventing deterioration in established safety procedures, recognizing the clear intent, encouragement, and dedication of Congress to further the highest degree of safety in air transportation and air commerce, and to maintain the safety vigilance that has evolved in air transportation and air commerce and has come to be expected by the traveling and shipping public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the availability of a variety of adequate, economic, efficient, and low-priced services without unreasonable discrimination or unfair or deceptive practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) coordinating transportation by, and improving relations among, air carriers, and encouraging fair wages and working conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) placing maximum reliance on competitive market forces and on actual and potential competition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide the needed air transportation system; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Sovereignty and Public Right of Transit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace. To further that right, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board established under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 792) before prescribing a regulation or issuing an order or procedure that will have a significant impact on the accessibility of commercial airports or commercial air transportation for handicapped individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Airspace</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall develop plans and policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. The Administrator may modify or revoke an assignment when required in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall prescribe air traffic regulations on the flight of aircraft (including regulations on safe altitudes) for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) navigating, protecting, and identifying aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) protecting individuals and property on the ground;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) using the navigable airspace efficiently; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) preventing collision between aircraft, between aircraft and land or water vehicles, and between aircraft and airborne objects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To establish security provisions that will encourage and allow maximum use of the navigable airspace by civil aircraft consistent with national security, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish areas in the airspace the Administrator decides are necessary in the interest of national defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by regulation or order, restrict or prohibit flight of civil aircraft that the Administrator cannot identify, locate, and control with available facilities in those areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the military exception in section 553(a)(1) of title 5, subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 applies to a regulation prescribed under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Foreign Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A foreign aircraft, not part of the armed forces of a foreign country, may be navigated in the United States as provided in section 41703 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Aircraft of Armed Forces of Foreign Countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Aircraft of the armed forces of a foreign country may be navigated in the United States only when authorized by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>No Exclusive Rights at Certain Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person does not have an exclusive right to use an air navigation facility on which Government money has been expended. However, providing services at an airport by only one fixed-based operator is not an exclusive right if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is unreasonably costly, burdensome, or impractical for more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) allowing more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services requires a reduction in space leased under an agreement existing on September 3, 1982, between the operator and the airport.</p>

<p class="note-body">(2) For the purpose of this convention the expression &ldquo;international transportation&rdquo; shall mean any transportation in which, according to the contract made by the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the transportation or a transshipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties, or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, if there is an agreed stopping place within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of another power, even though that power is not a party to this convention. Transportation without such an agreed stopping place between territories subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate, or authority of the same High Contracting Party shall not be deemed to be international for the purposes of this convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Transportation to be performed by several successive air carriers shall be deemed, for the purposes of this convention, to be one undivided transportation, if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it has been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it shall not lose its international character merely because one contract or series of contracts is to be performed entirely within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate, or authority of the same High Contracting Party.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Article 2</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">(1) This convention shall apply to transportation performed by the state or by legal entities constituted under public law provided it falls within the conditions laid down in article 1.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Order of Civil Aeronautics Board Approving Increases in Liability Limitations of Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol</h4>
<p class="note-body">Adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Board at its office in Washington, D.C., on the 13th day of May 1966.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, generally known as the Warsaw Convention, creates a uniform body of law with respect to the rights and responsibilities of passengers, shippers, and air carriers in international air transportation. The United States became a party to the Convention in 1934, and eventually over 90 countries likewise became parties to the Convention.<sup><a href="#40105_1_target" name="40105_1">1</a></sup> On November 15, 1965, the U.S. Government gave notice of denunciation of the Convention, emphasizing that such action was solely because of the Convention's low limits of liability for personal injury or death to passengers. Pursuant to Article 39 of the Convention this notice would become effective upon 6 months&rsquo; notice, in this case, May 15, 1966. Subsequently, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) made efforts to effect an arrangement among air carriers, foreign air carriers, and other carriers (including carriers not members of IATA) providing the major portions of international air carriage to and from the United States to increase the limitations of liability now applicable to claims for personal injury and death under the Convention and the Protocol. The purpose of such action is to provide a basis upon which the United States could withdrawn its notice of denunciation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The arrangement proposed has been embodied in an agreement (Agreement CAB 18900) between various air carriers, foreign air carriers, and other carriers which has been filed with the Board pursuant to section 412(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and Part 261 of the Board's economic regulations and assigned the abovedesignated CAB number.</p>
<p class="note-body">By this agreement, the parties thereto bind themselves to include in their tariffs, effective May 16, 1966, a special contract in accordance with Article 22(1) of the Convention or the Protocol providing for a limit of liability for each passenger for death, wounding, or other bodily injury of $75,000 inclusive of legal fees, and, in case of a claim brought in a State where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, a limit of $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs. These limitations shall be applicable to international transportation by the carrier as defined in the Convention or Protocol which includes a point in the United States as a point of origin, point of destination, or agreed stopping place. The parties further agree to provide in their tariffs that the Carrier shall not, with respect to any claim arising out of the death, wounding, or other bodily injury of a passenger, avail itself of any defense under Article 20(1) of the Convention or the Convention as amended by the Protocol. The tariff provisions would stipulate, however, that nothing therein shall be deemed to affect the rights and liabilities of the Carrier with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf of, or in respect of any person who has willfully caused damage which results in death, wounding, or other bodily injury of a passenger.</p>
<p class="note-body">The carriers by the agreement further stipulate that they will, at time of delivery of the tickets, furnish to each passenger governed by the Convention or the Protocol and by the special contract described above, a notice in 10 point type advising international passengers of the limitations of liability established by the Convention or the Protocol, or the higher liability agreed to by the special contracts pursuant to the Convention or Protocol as described above. The agreement is to become effective upon arrival by this Board, and any carrier may become a party to it by signing a counterpart thereof and depositing it with the Board. Withdrawal from the agreement may be effected by giving 12 months&rsquo; written notice to the Board and the other Carrier parties thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body">As indicated, the decision of the U.S. Government to serve notice to denounce the Convention was predi<!-- PDFPage:589 -->cated upon the low liability limits therein for personal injury and death. The Government announced, however, that it would be prepared to withdraw the Notice of Denunciation if, prior to its effective date, there is a reasonable prospect for international agreement on limits of liability for international transportation in the area of $100,000 per passenger or on uniform rules without any limit of liability, and if pending such international agreement there is a provisional arrangement among the principal international air carriers providing for liability up to $75,000 per passenger.</p>
<p class="note-body">Steps, have been taken by the signing carriers to have tariffs become effective May 16, 1966, upon approval of this agreement, which will increase by special contract their liability for personal injury or death as described herein. The signatory carriers provide by far the greater portion of international transportation to, from, and within the United States. The agreement will result in a salutory increase in the protection given to passengers from the increased liability amounts and the waiver of defenses under Article 20(1) of the Convention or Protocol. The U.S. Government has concluded that such arrangements warrant withdrawal of the Notice of Denunciation of the Warsaw Convention. Implementation of the agreement will permit continued adherence to the Convention with the benefits to be derived therefrom, but without the imposition of the low liability limits therein contained upon most international travel involving travel to or from the United States. The stipulation that no tariff provision shall be deemed to affect the rights and liabilities of the carrier with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf of, or in respect of any person who has willfully caused damage which results in death, wounding or other bodily injury of a passenger operates to diminish any incentive for sabotage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Upon consideration of the agreement, and of matters relating thereto of which the Board takes notice, the Board does not find that the agreement is adverse to the public interest or in violation of the Act and it will be approved.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, and particularly sections 102, 204(a), and 412 thereof:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>It is ordered</em>, That: 1. Agreement CAB 18900 is approved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Air Carriers and Foreign Air Carriers Not Engaged Directly in Operating Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may exempt from subpart II of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an air carrier not engaged directly in operating aircraft in air transportation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a foreign air carrier not engaged directly in operating aircraft in foreign air transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exemption is effective to the extent and for periods that the Secretary decides are in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Safety Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may grant an exemption from a regulation prescribed in carrying out sections 40103(b)(1) and (2), 40119, 44901, 44903, 44906, and 44935&ndash;44937 of this title when the Administrator decides the exemption is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Other Economic Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, the Secretary may exempt to the extent the Secretary considers necessary a person or class of persons from a provision of chapter 411, chapter 413 (except sections 41307 and 41310(b)&ndash;(f)), chapter 415 (except sections 41502, 41505, and 41507&ndash;41509), chapter 417 (except sections 41703, 41704, 41710, 41713, and 41714), chapter 419, subchapter II of chapter 421, and sections 44909 and 46301(b) of this title, or a regulation or term prescribed under any of those provisions, when the Secretary decides that the exemption is consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Labor Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not exempt an air carrier from section 42112 of this title. However, the Secretary may exempt from section 42112(b)(1) and (2) an air carrier not providing scheduled air transportation, and the operations conducted during daylight hours by an air carrier providing scheduled air transportation, when the Secretary decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) because of the limited extent of, or unusual circumstances affecting, the operation of the air carrier, the enforcement of section 42112(b)(1) and (2) of this title is or would be an unreasonable burden on the air carrier that would obstruct its development and prevent it from beginning or continuing operations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the exemption would not affect adversely the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Flying Hours</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not exempt an air carrier under this section from a provision referred to in subsection (c) of this section, or a regulation or term prescribed under any of those provisions, that sets maximum flying hours for pilots or copilots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Smaller Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An air carrier is exempt from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, and the Secretary may exempt an air carrier from another provision of subpart II of this part, if the air carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) provides passenger transportation only with aircraft having a maximum capacity of 55 passengers; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) provides the transportation of cargo only with aircraft having a maximum payload of less than 18,000 pounds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) complies with liability insurance requirements and other regulations the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may increase the passenger or payload capacities when the public interest requires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An exemption under this subsection applies to an air carrier providing air transpor<!-- PDFPage:593 -->tation between 2 places in Alaska, or between Alaska and Canada, only if the carrier is authorized by Alaska to provide the transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may limit the number or location of places that may be served by an air carrier providing transportation only in Alaska under an exemption from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, or the frequency with which the transportation may be provided, only when the Secretary decides that providing the transportation substantially impairs the ability of an air carrier holding a certificate issued by the Secretary to provide its authorized transportation, including the minimum transportation requirement for Alaska specified under section 41732(b)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Air Transportation by Foreign Air Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent that the Secretary decides an exemption is in the public interest, the Secretary may exempt by order a foreign air carrier from the requirements and limitations of this part for not more than 30 days to allow the foreign air carrier to carry passengers or cargo in interstate air transportation in certain markets if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) because of an emergency created by unusual circumstances not arising in the normal course of business, air carriers holding certificates under section 41102 of this title cannot accommodate traffic in those markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all possible efforts have been made to accommodate the traffic by using the resources of the air carriers, including the use of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) foreign aircraft, or sections of foreign aircraft, under lease or charter to the air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the air carriers&rsquo; reservations systems to the extent practicable;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the exemption is necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship for the traffic in the markets that cannot be accommodated by the air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) granting the exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in a labor dispute where the inability to accommodate traffic in a market is a result of the dispute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary grants an exemption to a foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that air transportation that the foreign air carrier provides under the exemption is made available on reasonable terms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) monitor continuously the passenger load factor of air carriers in the market that hold certificates under section 41102 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) review the exemption at least every 30 days to ensure that the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption still exist.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may renew an exemption (including renewals) under this subsection for not more than 30 days. An exemption may continue for not more than 5 days after the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Notice and Opportunity for Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may act under subsections (d) and (f)(3)(B) of this section only after giving the air carrier notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may make a contract of not more than 5 years for the following types of services and items of supply related to those services for which amounts otherwise would be available for obligation only in the fiscal year for which appropriated:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) operation, maintenance, and modification of aircraft, vehicles, and other highly complex equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills, including training of pilots and aircrew members and foreign language training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) base services, including ground maintenance, aircraft refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may make a contract under this section only if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there will be a continuing requirement for the service consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing the service will require a substantial initial investment in plant or equipment, or will incur a substantial contingent liability for assembling, training, or transporting a specialized workforce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When making a contract under this section, the Administrator shall be guided by the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The part of the cost of a plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance may not be more than the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life (instead of physical life) of the plant or equipment, considering the location and specialized nature of the plant or equipment, obsolescence, and other similar factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Administrator shall consider the desirability of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period of not more than 3 years, at a price that does not include charges for nonrecurring costs already amortized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reserving in the Administrator the right, on payment of the unamortized part of the cost of the plant or equipment, to take title to the plant or equipment under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Ending Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract made under this section shall be ended if amounts are not made available to continue the contract into a subsequent fiscal year. The cost of ending the contract may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appropriation originally available for carrying out the contract;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:599 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an appropriation currently available for procuring the type of service concerned and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) amounts appropriated for payments to end the contract.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31 and to the extent that amounts otherwise are available for obligation, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may make a contract of more than one but not more than 5 fiscal years to purchase property, except a contract to construct, alter, or make a major repair or improvement to real property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may make a contract under this section if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract will promote the safety or efficiency of the national airspace system and will result in reduced total contract costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the proposed contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the proposed contract period the Administrator will request appropriations for the contract at the level required to avoid cancellation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and the technical risks associated with the property are not excessive; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the estimates of the contract costs and the anticipated savings from the contract are realistic.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe regulations for acquiring property under this section to promote the use of contracts under this section in a way that will allow the most efficient use of those contracts. The regulations may provide for a cancellation provision in the contract to the extent the provision is necessary and in the best interest of the United States. The provision may include consideration of recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with producing the item to be delivered under the contract. The regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to broaden the aviation industrial base&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a contract under this section shall be used to seek, retain, and promote the use under that contract of subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on accrual of a payment or other benefit accruing on a contract under this section to a subcontractor, vendor, or supplier participating in the contract, the payment or benefit shall be delivered in the most expeditious way practicable; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this section and regulations prescribed under this section may not be carried out in a way that precludes or curtails the existing ability of the Administrator to provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) competition in producing items to be delivered under a contract under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ending a prime contract when performance is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Contract Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A contract under this section may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be used for the advance procurement of components, parts, and material necessary to manufacture equipment to be used in the national airspace system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide that performance under the contract after the first year is subject to amounts being appropriated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contain a negotiated priced option for varying the number of end items to be procured over the period of the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If feasible and practicable, an advance procurement contract may be made to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation Payment and Notice of Cancellation Ceiling</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a contract under this section provides that performance is subject to an appropriation being made, it also may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if the appropriation is not made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before awarding a contract under this section containing a cancellation ceiling of more than $100,000,000, the Administrator shall give written notice of the proposed contract and cancellation ceiling to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. The contract may not be awarded until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Ending Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract made under this section shall be ended if amounts are not made available to continue the contract into a subsequent fiscal year. The cost of ending the contract may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:600 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appropriation originally available for carrying out the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an appropriation currently available for procuring the type of property concerned and not otherwise obligated; or</p>

A certification of disagreement is void if it does not contain the reasons for the disagreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After receiving an application, the Secretary shall provide notice and an opportunity to air carriers, foreign air carriers, and other interested persons to comment on the application.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the application includes adequate justification for each of the specific projects; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of an application to impose a fee of more than $3.00 for an eligible surface transportation or terminal project, the agency has made adequate provision for financing the airside needs of the airport, including runways, taxiways, aprons, and aircraft gates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on Imposing Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An eligible agency may impose a passenger facility fee only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the Secretary approves an application that the agency has submitted under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subject to terms the Secretary may prescribe to carry out the objectives of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A lease or use agreement of an air carrier or foreign air carrier related to a project whose construction or expansion was financed with a passenger facility fee may not restrict the eligible agency from financing, developing, or assigning new capacity at the airport with passenger facility revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of Revenue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Passenger facility revenue is not airport revenue for purposes of establishing a price under a contract between an eligible agency and an air carrier or foreign air carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An eligible agency may not include in its price base the part of the capital costs of a project paid for by using passenger facility revenue to establish a price under a contract between the agency and an air carrier or foreign air carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a project for terminal development, gates and related areas, or a facility occupied or used by at least one air carrier or foreign air carrier on an exclusive or preferential basis, a price payable by an air carrier or foreign air carrier using the facilities must at least equal the price paid by an air carrier or foreign air carrier using a similar facility at the airport that was not financed with passenger facility revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Passenger facility revenues that are held by an air carrier or an agent of the carrier after collection of a passenger facility fee constitute a trust fund that is held by the air carrier or agent for the beneficial interest of the eligible agency imposing the fee. Such carrier or agent holds neither legal nor equitable interest in the passenger facility revenues except for any handling fee or retention of interest collected on unremitted proceeds as may be allowed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) As necessary to ensure compliance with this section, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring recordkeeping and auditing of accounts maintained by an air carrier or foreign air carrier and its agent collecting a passenger facility fee and by the eligible agency imposing the fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary periodically shall audit and review the use by an eligible agency of passenger facility revenue. After review and a public hearing, the Secretary may end any part of the authority of the agency to impose a passenger facility fee to the extent the Secretary decides that the revenue is not being used as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may set off amounts necessary to ensure compliance with this section against amounts otherwise payable to an eligible agency under subchapter I of chapter 471 of this title if the Secretary decides a passenger facility fee is excessive or that passenger facility revenue is not being used as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out this section. The regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may prescribe the time and form by which a passenger facility fee takes effect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require an air carrier or foreign air carrier and its agent to collect a passenger facility fee that an eligible agency imposes under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish procedures for handling and remitting money collected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) ensure that the money, less a uniform amount the Secretary determines reflects the average necessary and reasonable expenses (net of interest accruing to the carrier and agent after collection and before re<!-- PDFPage:607 -->mittance) incurred in collecting and handling the fee, is paid promptly to the eligible agency for which they are collected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) require that the amount collected for any air transportation be noted on the ticket for that air transportation; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may permit an eligible agency to request that collection of a passenger facility fee be waived for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) passengers enplaned by any class of air carrier or foreign air carrier if the number of passengers enplaned by the carriers in the class constitutes not more than one percent of the total number of passengers enplaned annually at the airport at which the fee is imposed; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Consultation and negotiation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In developing and making changes to the personnel management system initially implemented by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration on April 1, 1996, the Administrator shall negotiate with the exclusive bargaining representatives of employees of the Administration certified under section 7111 of title 5 and consult with other employees of the Administration.</p>

The 60-day period shall not include any period during which Congress has adjourned sine die.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Cost savings and productivity goals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administration and the exclusive bargaining representatives of the employees shall use every reasonable effort to find cost savings and to increase productivity within each of the affected bargaining units.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Election of Forum</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Where a major adverse personnel action may be contested through more than one of the indicated forums (such as the contractual grievance procedure, the Federal Aviation Administration's internal process, or that of the Merit Systems Protection Board), an employee must elect the forum through which the matter will be contested. Nothing in this section is intended to allow an employee to contest an action through more than one forum unless otherwise allowed by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;major adverse personnel action&rdquo; means a suspension of more than 14 days, a reduction in pay or grade, a removal for conduct or performance, a nondisciplinary removal, a furlough of 30 days or less (but not including placement in a nonpay status as the result of a lapse of appropriations or an enactment by Congress), or a reduction in force action.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41104. Additional limitations and requirements of charter air carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe a regulation or issue an order restricting the marketability, flexibility, accessibility, or variety of charter air transportation provided under a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title only to the extent required by the public interest. A regulation prescribed or order issued under this subsection may not be more restrictive than a regulation related to charter air transportation that was in effect on October 1, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Scheduled Operations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in paragraph (3), an air carrier, including an indirect air carrier, may not provide, in aircraft designed for more than 9 passenger seats, regularly scheduled charter air transportation for which the public is provided in advance a schedule containing the departure location, departure time, and arrival location of the flight unless such air transportation is to and from an airport that has an airport operating certificate issued under part 139 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (or any subsequent similar regulation).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;regularly scheduled charter air transportation&rdquo; does not include operations for which the departure time, departure location, and arrival location are specifically negotiated with the customer or the customer's representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not apply to any airport in the State of Alaska or to any airport outside the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier holding a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title may provide charter air transportation between places in Alaska only to the extent the Secretary decides the transportation is required by public convenience and necessity. The Secretary may make that decision when issuing, amending, or modifying the certificate. This subsection does not apply to a certificate issued under section 41102 to a citizen of the United States who, before July 1, 1977&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintained a principal place of business in Alaska; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conducted air transport operations between places in Alaska with aircraft with a certificate for gross takeoff weight of more than 40,000 pounds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Suspensions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall suspend for not more than 30 days any part of the certificate of a charter air carrier if the Secretary decides that the failure of the carrier to comply with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title, or a regulation or order of the Secretary under section 41110(e) or 41112, requires immediate suspension in the interest of the rights, welfare, or safety of the public. The Secretary may act under this paragraph without notice or a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall begin immediately a hearing to decide if the certificate referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection should be amended, modified, suspended, or revoked. Until the hearing is completed, the Secretary may suspend the certificate for additional periods totaling not more than 60 days. If the Secretary decides that the carrier is complying with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title and regulations and orders under sections 41110(e) and 41112, the Secretary immediately may end the suspension period and proceeding begun under this subsection. However, the Secretary is not prevented from imposing a civil penalty on the carrier for violating the requirements described in section 41110(e) or 41112 or a regulation or order under section 41110(e) or 41112.</p>

The bond or security must be sufficient to ensure the carrier adequately will pay the passengers and shippers when the transportation the carrier agrees to provide is not provided. The Secretary shall prescribe the amounts to be paid under this subsection.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) Departments and agencies outside of the Executive Office of the President that identify matters of national defense or foreign relations while a decision is pending before the DOT shall, except as confidentiality is required for reasons of defense or foreign policy, make those matters known to the DOT in the course of its proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) The DOT shall receive the recommendations, addressed to the President, of the departments and agencies referred to in section 3(c) of this Order.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) If any department or agency that made recommendations to the President pursuant to Section 801 believes that, if the President decides not to disapprove a decision, the letter so advising the DOT should include a statement that the decision not to disapprove was based on national defense or foreign relations reasons, it should so indicate separately and explain why.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. Individuals within the Executive Office of the President shall follow a policy of: (a) refusing to discuss matters relating to the disposition of a case subject to the review of the President under Section 801 with any interested private party, or an attorney or agent for any such party, prior to the decision by the President or his designee; and (b) referring any written communication from an interested private party, or an attorney or agent for any such party, to the appropriate department or agency outside of the Executive Office of the President.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Filing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier or foreign air carrier may file with the Secretary of Transportation a true copy of or, if oral, a true and complete memorandum of, an agreement (except an agreement related to interstate air transportation), or a request for authority to discuss cooperative arrangements (except arrangements related to interstate air transportation), and any modification or cancellation of an agreement, between the air carrier or foreign air carrier and another air carrier, a foreign carrier, or another carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall approve an agreement, request, modification, or cancellation referred to in subsection (a) of this section when the Secretary finds it is not adverse to the public interest and is not in violation of this part. However, the Secretary shall disapprove&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) or, after periodic review, end approval of, an agreement, request, modification, or cancellation, that substantially reduces or eliminates competition unless the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the agreement, request, modification, or cancellation is necessary to meet a serious transportation need or to achieve important public benefits (including international comity and foreign policy considerations); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transportation need cannot be met or those benefits cannot be achieved by reasonably available alternatives that are materially less anticompetitive; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an agreement that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is between an air carrier not directly operating aircraft in foreign air transportation and a carrier subject to subtitle IV of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) governs the compensation the carrier may receive for the transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice and Opportunity To Respond or for Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When an agreement, request, modification, or cancellation is filed, the Secretary of Transportation shall give the Attorney General and the Secretary of State written notice of, and an opportunity to submit written comments about, the filing. On the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on request of the Attorney General or Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation may conduct a hearing to decide whether an agreement, request, modification, or cancellation is consistent with this part whether or not it was approved previously.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding before the Secretary of Transportation applying standards under subsection (b)(1) of this section, a party opposing an agreement, request, modification, or cancellation has the burden of proving that it substantially reduces or eliminates competition and that less anticompetitive alternatives are available. The party defending the agreement, request, modification, or cancellation has the burden of proving the transportation need or public benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Transportation shall include the findings required by subsection (b)(1) of this section in an order of the Secretary approving or disapproving an agreement, request, modification, or cancellation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier or foreign air carrier may not subject a person, place, port, or type of traffic in foreign air transportation to unreasonable discrimination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review and Negotiation of Discriminatory Foreign Charges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall survey charges imposed on an air carrier by the government of a foreign country or another foreign entity for the use of airport property or airway property in foreign air transportation. If the Secretary of Transportation decides that a charge is discriminatory, the Secretary promptly shall report the decision to the Secretary of State. The Secretaries of State and Transportation promptly shall begin negotiations with the appropriate government to end the discrimination. If the discrimination is not ended in a reasonable time through negotiation, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish a compensating charge equal to the discriminatory charge. With the approval of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury shall impose the compensating charge on a <!-- PDFPage:638 -->foreign air carrier of that country as a condition to accepting the general declaration of the aircraft of the foreign air carrier when it lands or takes off.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain an account to credit money collected under paragraph (1) of this subsection. An air carrier shall be paid from the account an amount certified by the Secretary of Transportation to compensate the air carrier for the discriminatory charge paid to the government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Actions Against Discriminatory Activity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may take actions the Secretary considers are in the public interest to eliminate an activity of a government of a foreign country or another foreign entity, including a foreign air carrier, when the Secretary, on the initiative of the Secretary or on complaint, decides that the activity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is an unjustifiable or unreasonable discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive practice against an air carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) imposes an unjustifiable or unreasonable restriction on access of an air carrier to a foreign market.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may deny, amend, modify, suspend, revoke, or transfer under paragraph (1) of this subsection a foreign air carrier permit or tariff under section 41302, 41303, 41304(a), 41504(c), 41507, or 41509 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Filing of, and Acting on, Complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An air carrier, computer reservations system firm, or a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government may file a complaint under subsection (c) or (g) of this section with the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary shall approve, deny, or dismiss the complaint, set the complaint for a hearing or investigation, or begin another proceeding proposing remedial action not later than 60 days after receiving the complaint. The Secretary may extend the period for acting for additional periods totaling not more than 30 days if the Secretary decides that with additional time it is likely that a complaint can be resolved satisfactorily through negotiations with the government of the foreign country or foreign entity. The Secretary must act not later than 90 days after receiving the complaint. However, the Secretary may extend this 90-day period for not more than an additional 90 days if, on the last day of the initial 90-day period, the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) negotiations with the government have progressed to a point that a satisfactory resolution of the complaint appears imminent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an air carrier or computer reservations system firm has not been subjected to economic injury by the government or entity as a result of filing the complaint; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the public interest requires additional time before the Secretary acts on the complaint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out paragraph (1) of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) solicit the views of the Secretaries of Commerce and State and the United States Trade Representative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) give an affected air carrier or foreign air carrier reasonable notice and an opportunity to submit written evidence and arguments within the time limits of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) submit to the President under section 41307 or 41509(f) of this title actions proposed by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretaries of State, the Treasury, and Transportation and the heads of other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government shall keep under review, to the extent of each of their jurisdictions, each form of discrimination or unfair competitive practice to which an air carrier is subject when providing foreign air transportation or a computer reservations system firm is subject when providing services with respect to airline service. Each Secretary and head shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) take appropriate action to eliminate any discrimination or unfair competitive practice found to exist; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) request Congress to enact legislation when the authority to eliminate the discrimination or unfair practice is inadequate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall report to Congress annually on each action taken under paragraph (1) of this subsection and on the continuing program to eliminate discrimination and unfair competitive practices. The Secretaries of State and the Treasury each shall give the Secretary of Transportation information necessary to prepare the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after acting on a complaint under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on action taken under this section on the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Actions Against Discriminatory Activity by Foreign CRS Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may take such actions as the Secretary considers are in the public interest to eliminate an activity of a foreign air carrier that owns or markets a computer reservations system, or of a computer reservations system firm whose principal offices are located outside the United States, when the Secretary, on the initiative of the Secretary or on complaint, decides that the activity, with respect to airline service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is an unjustifiable or unreasonable discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive practice against a computer reservations system firm whose principal offices are located inside the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) imposes an unjustifiable or unreasonable restriction on access of such a computer reservations system to a foreign market.</p>

However, the Secretary may prescribe an alternative notice requirement, of at least 25 days, to allow an air carrier or foreign air carrier to match a proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier. A notice under this paragraph must state plainly the change proposed and when the change will take effect.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B) provides that 49 App.:1373 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation and 49 App.:1376(a)&ndash;(e), restated in section 41901 of the revised title, governs rates for the transportation of mail by aircraft. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The words &ldquo;passenger fare&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fare&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the word &ldquo;print&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;publish&rdquo;.

In clause (1)(A), the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;practices&rdquo;. In clauses (1)(B) and (2)(A), the word &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;for foreign air transportation&rdquo; are added because of 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B). See the revision notes for subsection (a) of this section. The words &ldquo;in the same way as required for a tariff under&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in accordance with&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fares or charges specified in another air carrier's or foreign air carrier's proposed tariff&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;not covered by&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to which such range of fares does not apply&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1482(d)(4) of this Appendix .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. section 1482(d)(7) of this Appendix&rdquo; are omitted because those sections related to interstate and overseas air transportation and the source provisions restated in this section relate to foreign air transportation. In addition, the text of 49 App.:1551(a)(5)(D) provides that 49 App.:1482(d) ceased to be in effect on January 1, 1985, except as related to foreign air transportation. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 1482(j)(9) of this Appendix&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to 49 App.:1482(j)(10) to correct an apparent error in the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 35). Section 24(b) of S. 1300 of the 96th Congress (the derivative source for the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979), as originally passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, restated section 403(c)(2) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 759) to read as it now does with a cross&ndash;reference to section 1002(j)(9) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Also contained in those versions of S. 1300 in section 24(a) was an amendment to section 1002(j) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to add a paragraph (9) that contained language identical to what is now section 1002(j)(10) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. When S. 1300 was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law as the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979, section 24(a) had been changed so that a different paragraph (9) was added and what had been paragraph (9) was now designated as a new paragraph (10) to be added. Apparently, when the conference committee redesignated section 1002(j)(9) as 1002(j)(10) it did not make a corresponding change in the cross&ndash;reference in section 403(c)(2). See 125 Cong. Rec. 26936, 32147, 36939.</p>

If the commuter air carrier does not give that notice, the uniform method of establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices referred to in subsection (b) of this section does not apply to the commuter air carrier.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1482a(2)(A) is omitted as unnecessary because the definition of &ldquo;air carrier&rdquo; in 49 App.:1301(3) is restated in section 40102(a) of the revised title and applies to this section and because the functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board under 49 App.:1482a were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(E) and the complete name of the Secretary is used the first time the term appears in a section. The text of 49 App.:1482a(3) is omitted as executed. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 416(b)(3) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 [49 App. U.S.C. 1386(b)(3)]&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to section 416(b)(4) to correct an apparent error in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;504, 92 Stat. 1705). Section 24 of H.R. 12611 of the 95th Congress (the derivative source for 416(b)(4)), added section 416(b)(3) to the Federal Aviation Act. Section 29(c) added provisions that eventually were classified as 49 App.:1482a. Those provisions contained a reference to section 416(b)(3). When S. 2493 (passed in lieu of the House bill after being amended to contain much of the text of the House bill) was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law, section 32 added what had been a new 416(b)(3) as a new 416(b)(4). However, the conference committee did not make a corresponding change in the cross-reference in section 37(c), that added 49 App.:1482a. See 124 Cong. Rec. 30714, 30716, 36521, 36524. The word &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;pursuant to flight schedules&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;the same 2 places&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;one pair of points&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;pursuant to its authority&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;passengers&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;persons&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words &ldquo;through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier's routes&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation over its routes&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;between air carriers and commuter air carriers&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41509. Authority of the Secretary of Transportation to suspend, cancel, and reject tariffs for foreign air transportation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation and Rejection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on a complaint filed with the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether a price for foreign air transportation contained in an existing or newly filed tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier, a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price, or the value of the transportation provided under that price, is lawful. The Secretary may begin the hearing at once and without an answer or another formal pleading by the air carrier or foreign air carrier, but only after reasonable notice. If, after the hearing, the Secretary decides that the price, classification, rule, or practice is or will be unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory, the Secretary may cancel or reject the tariff and prevent the use of the price, classification, rule, or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With or without a hearing, the Secretary may cancel or reject an existing or newly filed tariff of a foreign air carrier and prevent the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the Secretary decides that the cancellation or rejection is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In deciding whether to cancel or reject a tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the price on the movement of traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient transportation by air carriers and foreign air carriers at the lowest cost consistent with providing the transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the standards prescribed under law related to the character and quality of transportation to be provided by air carriers and foreign air carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inherent advantages of transportation by aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the need of the air carrier and foreign air carrier for revenue sufficient to enable the air carrier and foreign air carrier, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide adequate and efficient air carrier and foreign air carrier transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) whether the price will be predatory or tend to monopolize competition among air <!-- PDFPage:647 -->carriers and foreign air carriers in foreign air transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) reasonably estimated or foreseeable future costs and revenues for the air carrier or foreign air carrier for a reasonably limited future period during which the price would be in effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) other factors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Suspension</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) Pending a decision under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary may suspend a tariff and the use of a price contained in the tariff or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may suspend a tariff of a foreign air carrier and the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the suspension is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A suspension becomes effective when the Secretary files with the tariff and delivers to the air carrier or foreign air carrier affected by the suspension a written statement of the reasons for the suspension. To suspend a tariff, reasonable notice of the suspension must be given to the affected carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The suspension of a newly filed tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date the tariff otherwise would go into effect. The suspension of an existing tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the effective date of the suspension. The Secretary may rescind at any time the suspension of a newly filed tariff and allow the price, classification, rule, or practice to go into effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effective Tariffs and Prices When Tariff Is Suspended, Canceled, or Rejected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a tariff is suspended pending the outcome of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section and the Secretary does not take final action in the proceeding during the suspension period, the tariff goes into effect at the end of that period subject to cancellation when the proceeding is concluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During the period of suspension, or after the cancellation or rejection, of a newly filed tariff (including a tariff that has gone into effect provisionally), the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier shall maintain in effect and use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the corresponding seasonal prices, or the classifications, rules, and practices affecting those prices or the value of transportation provided under those prices, that were in effect for the carrier immediately before the new tariff was filed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) another price provided for under an applicable intergovernmental agreement or understanding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the suspended, canceled, or rejected tariff is the first tariff of the carrier for the covered transportation, the carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an existing tariff is suspended or canceled, the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Response to Refusal of Foreign Country To Allow Air Carrier To Charge a Price</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary finds that the government or an aeronautical authority of a foreign country has refused to allow an air carrier to charge a price contained in a tariff filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary, without a hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may suspend any existing tariff of a foreign air carrier providing transportation between the United States and the foreign country for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date of the suspension; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may order the foreign air carrier to charge, during the suspension periods, prices that are the same as those contained in a tariff (designated by the Secretary) of an air carrier filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a foreign air carrier may continue to provide foreign air transportation to the foreign country only if the government or aeronautical authority of the foreign country allows an air carrier to start or continue foreign air transportation to the foreign country at the prices designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Standard Foreign Fare Level</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In this subsection, &ldquo;standard foreign fare level&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for a class of fares existing on October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places (as adjusted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) filed for and allowed by the Civil Aeronautics Board to go into effect after September 30, 1979, and before August 13, 1980 (with seasonal fares adjusted by the percentage difference that prevailed between seasons in 1978), or the fare established under section 1002(j)(8) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 731), as added by section 24(a) of the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 46); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a class of fares established after October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places in effect on the effective date of the establishment of the new class.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least once every 60 days for fuel costs, and at least once every 180 days for other costs, the Secretary shall adjust the standard foreign fare level for the particular foreign air transportation to which the standard foreign fare level applies by increasing or decreasing that level by the percentage change from the last previous period in the actual operating cost for each available seat-mile. In adjusting a standard foreign fare level, the Secretary may not make an adjustment to costs actually incurred. In establishing a standard foreign fare level and making adjustments in the level under this paragraph, <!-- PDFPage:648 -->the Secretary may use all relevant or appropriate information reasonably available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not decide that a proposed fare for foreign air transportation is unreasonable on the basis that the fare is too low or too high if the proposed fare is neither more than 5 percent higher nor 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level for the same or essentially similar class of transportation. The Secretary by regulation may increase the 50 percent specified in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply to a proposed fare that is not more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 5 percent higher than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be unreasonably discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is in the public interest because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be predatory or discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is required because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Submission of Orders to President</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall submit to the President an order made under this section suspending, canceling, or rejecting a price for foreign air transportation, and an order rescinding the effectiveness of such an order, before publishing the order. Not later than 10 days after its submission, the President may disapprove the order on finding disapproval is necessary for United States foreign policy or national defense reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Compliance as Condition of Certificate or Permit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section and compliance with an order of the Secretary under this section are conditions to any certificate or permit held by an air carrier or foreign air carrier. An air carrier or foreign air carrier may provide foreign air transportation only as long as the carrier maintains prices for that transportation that comply with this section and orders of the Secretary under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Operational authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If basic essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter is to be provided from an eligible point to a high density airport (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), the Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the air carrier providing or selected to provide such service has sufficient operational authority at the high density airport to provide such service. The operational authority shall allow flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of passengers with connecting flights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If necessary to carry out the objectives of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall by order grant exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to air carriers using Stage 3 aircraft or to commuter air carriers, unless such an exemption would significantly increase operational delays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds that an exemption under paragraph (2) would significantly increase operational delays, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that an air carrier providing or selected to provide basic essential air service is able to obtain access to a high density airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Action by the secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue a final order under this subsection on or before the 60th day after receiving a request from an air carrier for operational authority under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Matters to be considered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall continue the Secretary's current examination of slot regulations and shall ensure that the examination includes consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether improvements in technology and procedures of the air traffic control system and the use of quieter aircraft make it possible to eliminate the limitations on hourly operations imposed by the high density rule contained in part 93 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations or to increase the number of operations permitted under such rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the effects of the elimination of limitations or an increase in the number of operations allowed on each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) congestion and delay in any part of the national aviation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the impact of noise on persons living near the airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) competition in the air transportation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the profitability of operations of airlines serving the airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) aviation safety;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the impact of the current slot allocation process upon the ability of air carriers to provide essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the impact of such allocation process upon the ability of new entrant air carriers to obtain slots in time periods that enable them to provide service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the impact of such allocation process on the ability of foreign air carriers to obtain slots;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the fairness of such process to air carriers and the extent to which air carriers are provided equivalent rights of access to the air transportation market in the countries of which foreign air carriers holding slots are citizens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the impact, on the ability of air carriers to provide domestic and international air service, of the withdrawal of slots from air carriers in order to provide slots for foreign air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the impact of the prohibition on slot withdrawals in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section on the aviation relationship between the United States Government and foreign governments, including whether the prohibition in such subsections will require the withdrawal of slots from general and military aviation in order to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers providing foreign air transportation (and the impact of such withdrawal on general aviation and military aviation) and whether slots will become available to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation as a result of the planned relocation of Air Force Reserve units and the Air National Guard at O'Hare International Airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than January 31, 1995, the Secretary shall complete the current examination of slot regulations and shall transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report containing the results of such examination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the demonstrated reliability of the applicant in providing scheduled air service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contractual and marketing arrangements the applicant has made with a larger carrier to ensure service beyond the hub airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the interline arrangements that the applicant has made with a larger carrier to allow passengers and cargo of the applicant at the hub airport to be transported by the larger carrier through one reservation, ticket, and baggage check-in;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the preferences of the actual and potential users of air transportation at the eligible place, giving substantial weight to the views of the elected officials representing the users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for an eligible place in Alaska, the experience of the applicant in providing, in Alaska, scheduled air service, or significant patterns of non-scheduled air service under an exemption granted under section 40109(a) and (c)&ndash;(h) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under guidelines prescribed under section 41737(a) of this title, the Secretary shall pay the rate of compensation for providing basic essential air service under this section and section 41734 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section at times and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall end payment of compensation to an air carrier for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place when the Secretary decides the compensation is no longer necessary to maintain basic essential air service to the place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place. Based on the review and consultations with an interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of service, to the extent such adjustments are to a level not less than the basic essential air service level established under subsection (a) for the airport that serves the community.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for</cap-smallcap> 30 <cap-smallcap>Days After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an additional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for Additional</cap-smallcap> 30-<cap-smallcap>Day Periods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the 30-day period under subsection (b) of this section the Secretary decides another air carrier will not provide basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing service to continue to provide service for additional 30-day periods until another carrier begins providing service on a continuing basis. At the end of each 30-day period, the Secretary shall decide if another carrier will provide service on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Compensation After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier receiving compensation under section 41733 of this title for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place is required to continue to provide service to the place under this section after the 90-day notice period under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall continue to pay that compensation after the last day of that period. The Secretary shall pay the compensation until the Secretary finds another carrier to provide the service to the place or the 90th day after the end of that notice period, whichever is earlier. If, after the 90th day after the end of the 90-day notice period, the Secretary has not found another carrier to provide the service, the carrier required to continue to provide that service shall receive compensation sufficient&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Compensation to Air Carriers Originally Providing Service Without Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary requires an air carrier providing basic essential air service to an eligible place without compensation under section 41733 of this title to continue providing that service after the 90-day notice period required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide the carrier with compensation after the end of the 90-day notice period that is sufficient&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Finding Replacement Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary requires an air carrier to continue to provide basic essential air service to an eligible place, the Secretary shall continue to make every effort to find another carrier to provide at least that basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier, providing basic essential air service under section 41733 of this title between an eligible place and an airport at which the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration limits the number of instrument flight rule takeoffs and landings of aircraft, provides notice under subsection (a) of this section of an intention to end, suspend, or reduce that service and another carrier is found to provide the service, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to transfer any operational authority the carrier has to land or take off at that airport related to the service to the eligible place to the carrier that will provide the service, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier that will provide the service needs the authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority to be transferred is being used to provide air service to another eligible place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Nonconsideration of Slot Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, the Secretary shall not consider as a factor whether slots at a high density airport are available for providing such service.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State or local government may submit a proposal to the Secretary of Transportation for enhanced essential air service to an eligible place for which basic essential air service is being provided under section 41733 of this title. The proposal shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify the level and type of enhanced essential air service the State or local government considers appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include an agreement related to compensation required for the proposed service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The agreement submitted under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State or local government or a person pay 50 percent of the compensation required for the proposed service and the United States Government pay the remaining 50 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the Government pay 100 percent of the compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if the proposed service is not successful for at least a 2-year period under the criteria prescribed by the Secretary under paragraph (3) of this subsection, the eligible place is not eligible for air service or air transportation for which compensation is paid by the Secretary under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation objective criteria for deciding whether enhanced essential air service to an eligible place under this section is successful in terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) increasing passenger usage of the airport facilities at the place; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) reducing the amount of compensation provided by the Secretary under this subchapter for that service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Decisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 90 days after receiving a proposal under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the Secretary decides the proposal is not reasonable, disapprove the proposal and notify the State or local government of the disapproval and the reasons for the disapproval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section when and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. Compensation for enhanced essential air service under this section may be paid only for the costs incurred in providing air service to an eligible place that are in addition to the costs incurred in providing basic essential <!-- PDFPage:670 -->air service to the place under section 41733 of this title. The Secretary shall continue to pay compensation under this section only as long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the air carrier maintains the level of enhanced essential air service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation under this section continues to pay the compensation; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may require the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation under this section to make advance payments or provide other security to ensure that timely payments are made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall review periodically the enhanced essential air service provided to each eligible place under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For service for which the Government pays 50 percent of the compensation, based on the review and consultation with the affected community and the State or local government or person paying the remaining 50 percent of the compensation, the Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments in the type and level of service to the place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Proposals and Decisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State or local government may propose to the Secretary of Transportation that the Secretary provide compensation to an air carrier to provide air transportation to a place that is not an eligible place under this subchapter. Not later than 90 days after receiving a proposal under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decide whether to designate the place as eligible to receive compensation under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) approve the proposal if the State or local government or a person is willing and able to pay 50 percent of the compensation for providing the transportation, and notify the State or local government of the approval; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) disapprove the proposal if the Secretary decides the proposal is not reasonable under paragraph (2) of this subsection, and notify the State or local government of the disapproval and the reasons for the disapproval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In deciding whether a proposal is reasonable, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the traffic-generating potential of the place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the cost to the United States Government of providing the proposed transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the distance of the place from the closest hub airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval for Certain Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall approve a pro<!-- PDFPage:671 -->posal under this section to compensate an air carrier for providing air transportation to a place in the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia and designate the place as eligible for compensation under this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at any time before October 23, 1978, the place was served by a carrier holding a certificate under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the place is more than 50 miles from the nearest small hub airport or an eligible place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the place is more than 150 miles from the nearest hub airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the State or local government submitting the proposal or a person is willing and able to pay 25 percent of the cost of providing the compensated transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraph (4) does not apply to any community approved for service under this section during the period beginning October 1, 1991, and ending December 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Level of Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary designates a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible for compensation under this section, the Secretary shall decide, not later than 6 months after the date of the designation, on the level of air transportation to be provided under this section. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the place is located, and the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for the transportation under subsection (b)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After making the decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall provide notice that any air carrier that is willing to provide the level of air transportation established under paragraph (1) for a place may submit an application to provide the transportation. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the factors listed in section 41733(c)(1) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the views of the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for the transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section when and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the air carrier maintains the level of air transportation established by the Secretary under subsection (c)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for transportation under this section continues to pay that compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary decides the compensation is necessary to maintain the transportation to the place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may require the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation under this section to make advance payments or provide other security to ensure that timely payments are made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of air transportation provided under this section. Based on the review and consultation with any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Withdrawal of Eligibility Designations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After providing notice and an opportunity for interested persons to comment, the Secretary may withdraw the designation of a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible to receive compensation under this section if the place has received air transportation under this section for at least 2 years and the Secretary decides the withdrawal would be in the public interest. The Secretary by regulation shall prescribe standards for deciding whether the withdrawal of a designation under this subsection is in the public interest. The standards shall include the factors listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Ending, Suspending, and Reducing Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier providing air transportation for compensation under this section may end, suspend, or reduce that transportation below the level of transportation established by the Secretary under this section only after giving the Secretary, the affected community, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section at least 30 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing the transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe guidelines governing the rate of compensation payable under this subchapter.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide for a reduction in compensation when an air carrier does not provide service or transportation agreed to be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consider amounts needed by an air carrier to promote public use of the service or transportation for which compensation is being paid; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) include expense elements based on representative costs of air carriers providing scheduled air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on aircraft of the type the Secretary decides is appropriate for providing the service or transportation for which compensation is being provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Promotional amounts described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be a special, segregated element of the compensation provided to a carrier under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may pay compensation to an air carrier for providing air service or air transportation under this subchapter only if the Secretary finds the carrier is able to provide the service or transportation in a reliable way.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if denying the claim, notify the carrier of the denial and the reasons for the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Make Agreements and Incur Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may make agreements and incur obligations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund established under section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9502) to pay compensation under this subchapter.

<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;fix and determine&rdquo; and &ldquo;fixing and determining&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;fair and reasonable&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate an unnecessary word. See the revision notes following 49:10101.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) to make clear that the United States Postal Service derives its authority to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate transportation from 39:5402(d) and (f). The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (1st sentence related to non-Alaska interstate and overseas air transportation less words between parentheses) is omitted as superseded by 39:5402(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 5402 of title 39&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (2d, last sentences) is omitted as executed. In clauses (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;prices&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rates of compensation&rdquo; for consistency in this part. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;an opportunity for a hearing on the record&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; for clarity and consistency with subsection (f) of this section. The words &ldquo;to be paid by the Postal Service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The United States Postal Service shall make payments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of so much of the total compensation as is fixed and determined by the Board under this section without regard to clause (3) of subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(c) to eliminate unnecessary words because the text of 49 App.:1376(b) (2d sentence words after 2d semicolon) is being omitted. See the revision notes for subsection (d) of this section. The words &ldquo;out of appropriations for the transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; are omitted as being superseded by chapters 20 and 24 of title 39, United States Code. The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (2d sentence) is omitted as expired because of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence). The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence) is omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;and to make such rates effective from such date as it shall determine to be proper&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted because the power to determine when rates go into effect is included in the power to prescribe rates. The words &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) and (E) provides that transportation of mail in interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska) is transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Postal Service leaving the balance of authority under 49 App.:1376(a) with the Secretary of Transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide (with any knowledge of the employer) or cause to be provided to the employer or Federal Government information relating to any violation or alleged violation of any order, regulation, or standard of the Federal Aviation Administration or any other provision of Federal law relating to air carrier safety under this subtitle or any other law of the United States;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:688 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has filed, caused to be filed, or is about to file (with any knowledge of the employer) or cause to be filed a proceeding relating to any violation or alleged violation of any order, regulation, or standard of the Federal Aviation Administration or any other provision of Federal law relating to air carrier safety under this subtitle or any other law of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) testified or is about to testify in such a proceeding; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Department of Labor Complaint Procedure.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Filing and notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection (a) may, not later than 90 days after the date on which such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging such discharge or discrimination. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary of Labor shall notify, in writing, the person named in the complaint and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration of the filing of the complaint, of the allegations contained in the complaint, of the substance of evidence supporting the complaint, and of the opportunities that will be afforded to such person under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Investigation; preliminary order.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1) and after affording the person named in the complaint an opportunity to submit to the Secretary of Labor a written response to the complaint and an opportunity to meet with a representative of the Secretary to present statements from witnesses, the Secretary of Labor shall conduct an investigation and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has merit and notify, in writing, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed a violation of subsection (a) of the Secretary's findings. If the Secretary of Labor concludes that there is a reasonable cause to believe that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary shall accompany the Secretary's findings with a preliminary order providing the relief prescribed by paragraph (3)(B). Not later than 30 days after the date of notification of findings under this paragraph, either the person alleged to have committed the violation or the complainant may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of such objections shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy contained in the preliminary order. Such hearings shall be conducted expeditiously. If a hearing is not requested in such 30-day period, the preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Required showing by complainant</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Labor shall dismiss a complaint filed under this subsection and shall not conduct an investigation otherwise required under subparagraph (A) unless the complainant makes a prima facie showing that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Showing by employer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the complainant has made the showing required under clause (i), no investigation otherwise required under subparagraph (A) shall be conducted if the employer demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for determination by secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may determine that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Relief may not be ordered under subparagraph (A) if the employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Final order.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Deadline for issuance; settlement agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 120 days after the date of conclusion of a hearing under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Labor shall issue a final order providing the relief prescribed by this paragraph or denying the complaint. At any time before issuance of a final order, a proceeding under this subsection may be terminated on the basis of a settlement agreement entered into by the Secretary of Labor, the complainant, and the person alleged to have committed the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Remedy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, in response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Labor determines that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary of Labor shall order the person who committed such violation to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reinstate the complainant to his or her former position together with the compensation (including back pay) and restore the terms, conditions, and privileges associated with his or her employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) provide compensatory damages to the complainant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If such an order is issued under this paragraph, the Secretary of Labor, at the request of the complainant, shall assess against the person against whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; and expert witness fees) reasonably incurred, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, by <!-- PDFPage:689 -->the complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing the complaint upon which the order was issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Frivolous complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Labor finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) is frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, the Secretary of Labor may award to the prevailing employer a reasonable attorney's fee not exceeding $1,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Review.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Appeal to court of appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (3) may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of such violation. The petition for review must be filed not later than 60 days after the date of the issuance of the final order of the Secretary of Labor. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The commencement of proceedings under this subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on collateral attack</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An order of the Secretary of Labor with respect to which review could have been obtained under subparagraph (A) shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement of order by secretary of labor</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever any person has failed to comply with an order issued under paragraph (3), the Secretary of Labor may file a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the violation was found to occur to enforce such order. In actions brought under this paragraph, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement of order by parties.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Commencement of action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person on whose behalf an order was issued under paragraph (3) may commence a civil action against the person to whom such order was issued to require compliance with such order. The appropriate United States district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Attorney fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, in issuing any final order under this paragraph, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any party whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Mandamus</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any nondiscretionary duty imposed by this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding brought under section 1361 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplicability to Deliberate Violations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to an employee of an air carrier, contractor, or subcontractor who, acting without direction from such air carrier, contractor, or subcontractor (or such person's agent), deliberately causes a violation of any requirement relating to air carrier safety under this subtitle or any other law of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking the certificate of registration for an aircraft issued to an owner under section 44103 of this title and any other certificate of registration that the owner of the aircraft holds under section 44103, if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the aircraft was used to carry out, or facilitate, an activity that is punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owner of the aircraft permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An aircraft owner that is not an individual is deemed to have permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection only if a majority of the individuals who control the owner of the aircraft or who are involved in forming the major policy of the owner permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advice to Holders and Opportunity To Answer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) advise the holder of the certificate of the charges or reasons on which the Administrator bases the proposed action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to answer the charges and state why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The Board shall affirm or reverse the order after providing notice and a hearing on the record. In conducting the hearing, the Board is not bound by the findings of fact of the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a person files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Board shall dispose of the appeal not later than 60 days after notification by the Administrator under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person substantially affected by an order of the Board under this subsection may seek judicial review of the order under section 46110 of this title. The Administrator shall be made a party to that judicial proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acquittal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator may not revoke, and the Board may not affirm a revocation of, a certificate of registration under this section on the basis of an activity described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section if the holder of the certificate is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator has revoked a certificate of registration of a person under this section because of an activity described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the Administrator shall reissue a certificate to the person if the person&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An aircraft may be insured or reinsured for not more than its reasonable value as determined by the Secretary in accordance with reasonable business practices in the commercial aviation insurance industry.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may reimburse an air carrier for the increase in the cost of insurance, with respect to a premium for coverage ending before October 1, 2002, against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of an American aircraft over the insurance premium that was in effect for a comparable operation during the period beginning September 4, 2001, and ending September 10, 2001, as the Secretary may determine. Such reimbursement is subject to subsections (a)(2), (c), and (d) of this section and to section 44303.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Payment from revolving fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A reimbursement under this subsection shall be paid from the revolving fund established by section 44307.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Further conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may impose such further conditions on insurance for which the increase in premium is subject to reimbursement under this subsection as the Secretary may deem appropriate in the interest of air commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Termination of authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to reimburse air carriers under this subsection shall expire 180 days after the date of enactment of this paragraph.</p>

The President may approve the insurance or reinsurance or the reimbursement only after deciding that the continued operation of the American aircraft or foreign-flag aircraft to be insured or reinsured is necessary in the interest of air commerce or national security or to carry out the foreign policy of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President may require the Secretary to consult with interested departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government before providing insurance or reinsurance or reimbursing an air carrier under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Additional Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With the approval of the Secretary, a person having an insurable interest in an aircraft may insure with other underwriters in an amount that is more than the amount insured with the Secretary.

An interested person may apply for a certificate for a facility to be acquired, established, constructed, operated, repaired, altered, or maintained by or for the person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Ensuring Conformity With Plans and Policies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To ensure conformity with plans <!-- PDFPage:707 -->and policies for, and allocation of, airspace by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under section 40103(b)(1) of this title, a military airport, military landing area, or missile or rocket site may be acquired, established, or constructed, or a runway may be altered substantially, only if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is given reasonable prior notice so that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may advise the appropriate committees of Congress and interested departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government on the effect of the acquisition, establishment, construction, or alteration on the use of airspace by aircraft. A disagreement between the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Secretary of Defense or the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration may be appealed to the President for a final decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To ensure conformity, an airport or landing area not involving the expenditure of Government money may be established or constructed, or a runway may be altered substantially, only if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is given reasonable prior notice so that the Administrator may provide advice on the effects of the establishment, construction, or alteration on the use of airspace by aircraft.</p>

The head of the department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide for the assistance and sale at the prevailing local fair market value as determined by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality. An amount that the head decides is equal to the cost of the assistance provided and the fuel, oil, equipment, and supplies sold shall be credited to the appropriation from which the cost was paid. The balance shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Transfers of Instrument Landing Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An airport may transfer, without consideration, to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration an instrument landing system (and associated approach lighting equipment and runway visual range equipment) that conforms to performance specifications of the Administrator if a Government airport aid program, airport development aid program, or airport improvement project grant was used to assist in purchasing the system.

On receiving an application for a type certificate, the Administrator shall investigate the application and may conduct a hearing. The Administrator shall make, or require the applicant to make, tests the Administrator considers necessary in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify in regulations those appliances that reasonably require a type certificate in the interest of safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include in a type certificate terms required in the interest of safety; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the holder of a supplemental type certificate agrees to permit another person to use the certificate to modify an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance, the holder shall provide the other person with written evidence, in a form acceptable to the Administrator, of that agreement. A person may change an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance based on a supplemental type certificate only if the person requesting the change is the holder of the supplemental type certificate or has permission from the holder to make the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Production Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall issue a production certificate authorizing the production of a duplicate of an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance for which a type certificate has been issued when the Administrator finds the duplicate will conform to the certificate.

The Administrator may include in a production certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Airworthiness Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The registered owner of an aircraft may apply to the Administrator for an airworthiness certificate for the aircraft.

The Administrator shall register each airworthiness certificate and may include appropriate information in the certificate. The certificate number or other individual designation the Administrator requires shall be displayed on the aircraft. The Administrator may include in an airworthiness certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person applying for the issuance or renewal of an airworthiness certificate for an aircraft for which ownership has not been recorded under section 44107 or 44110 of this title must submit with the application information related to the ownership of the aircraft the Administrator decides is necessary to identify each person having a property interest in the aircraft and the kind and extent of the interest.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; has the same meaning given that term in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking an airman certificate issued an individual under section 44703 of this title after the individual is convicted, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance), of an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an aircraft was used to commit, or facilitate the commission of, the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the individual served as an airman, or was on the aircraft, in connection with committing, or facilitating the commission of, the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall issue an order revoking an airman certificate issued an individual under section 44703 of this title if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the individual knowingly carried out an activity punishable, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance), by death or imprisonment for more than one year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an aircraft was used to carry out or facilitate the activity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the individual served as an airman, or was on the aircraft, in connection with carrying out, or facilitating the carrying out of, the activity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator has no authority under paragraph (1) of this subsection to review whether an airman violated a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advice to Holders and Opportunity To Answer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) advise the holder of the certificate of the charges or reasons on which the Administrator relies for the proposed revocation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to answer the charges and be heard why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An individual whose certificate is revoked by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section may appeal the revocation order to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Board shall affirm or reverse the order after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record. When conducting the hearing, the Board is not bound by findings of fact of the Administrator but shall be bound by all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations the Administrator carries out and of written agency policy guidance available to the public related to sanctions to be imposed under this section unless the Board finds an interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not according to law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When an individual files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Board shall make a final disposition of the appeal not later than 60 days after the Administrator so advises the Board.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An individual substantially affected by an order of the Board under this subsection, or the Administrator when the Administrator decides that an order of the Board will have a significant adverse effect on carrying out this part, may obtain judicial review of the order under section 46110 of this title. The Administrator shall be made a party to the judicial review proceedings. Findings of fact of the Board are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acquittal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator may not revoke, and the Board may not affirm a revocation of, an airman certificate under subsection (b)(2) of this section on the basis of an activity described in subsection (b)(2)(A) if the holder of the certificate is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator has revoked an airman certificate under this section because of an activity described in subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section, the Administrator shall reissue a certificate to the individual if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the individual otherwise satisfies the requirements for a certificate under section 44703 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the individual subsequently is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the conviction on which a revocation under subsection (b)(1) of this section is based is reversed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Waivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may waive the requirement of subsection (b) of this section <!-- PDFPage:733 -->that an airman certificate of an individual be revoked if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Administrator decides that the waiver will facilitate law enforcement efforts.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Equipment Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier shall make, or cause to be made, any inspection, repair, or maintenance of equipment used in air transportation as required by this part or regulations prescribed or orders issued by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under this part. A person operating, inspecting, repairing, or maintaining the equipment shall comply with those requirements, regulations, and orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Duties of Inspectors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall employ inspectors who shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inspect aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, and appliances designed for use in air transportation, during manufacture and when in use by an air carrier in air transportation, to enable the Administrator to decide whether the aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, or appliances are in safe condition and maintained properly; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) advise and cooperate with the air carrier during that inspection and maintenance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Unsafe Aircraft, Engines, Propellers, and Appliances</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When an inspector decides that an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance is not in condition for safe operation, the inspector shall notify the air carrier in the form and way prescribed by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. For 5 days after the carrier is notified, the aircraft, engine, propeller, or appliance may not be used in air transportation or in a way that endangers air transportation unless the Administrator or the inspector decides the aircraft, engine, propeller, or appliance is in condition for safe operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Modifications in System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall make modifications in the system for processing forms for major repairs or alterations to fuel tanks and fuel systems of aircraft not used to provide air transportation that are necessary to make the system more effective in serving the needs of users of the system, including officials responsible for enforcing laws related to the regulation of controlled substances (as defined in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802)). The modifications shall address at least each of the following deficiencies in, and abuses of, the existing system:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the excessive period of time required to receive the forms at the Airmen and Aircraft Registry of the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the backlog of forms waiting for processing at the Registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the lack of ready access by law enforcement officials to information contained on the forms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations to carry out paragraph (1) of this subsection and provide a written explanation of how the regulations address each of the deficiencies and abuses described in paragraph (1). In prescribing the regulations, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consult with the Administrator of Drug Enforcement, the Commissioner of Customs, other law enforcement officials of the United States Government, representatives of State and local law enforcement officials, representatives of the general aviation aircraft industry, representatives of users of general aviation aircraft, and other interested persons.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) regulations to control and abate aircraft noise and sonic boom.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator, as the Administrator deems appropriate, shall provide for the participation of a representative of the Environmental Protection Agency on such advisory committees or associated working groups that advise the Administrator on matters related to the environmental effects of aircraft and aircraft engines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may prescribe standards and regulations under this subsection only after consulting with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The standards and regulations shall be applied when issuing, amending, modifying, suspending, or revoking a certificate authorized under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An original type certificate may be issued under section 44704(a) of this title for an aircraft for which substantial noise abatement can be achieved only after the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration prescribes standards and regulations under this section that apply to that aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Considerations and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a standard or regulation under this section, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider relevant information related to aircraft noise and sonic boom;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with appropriate departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government and State and interstate authorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider whether the standard or regulation is consistent with the highest degree of safety in air transportation or air commerce in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider whether the standard or regulation is economically reasonable, technologically practicable, and appropriate for the applicable aircraft, aircraft engine, appliance, or certificate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) consider the extent to which the standard or regulation will carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Proposed Regulations of Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall submit to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration proposed regulations to control and abate aircraft noise and sonic boom (including control and abatement through the use of the authority of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration) that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency considers necessary to protect the public health and welfare. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consider those proposed regulations and shall publish them in a notice of proposed regulations not later than 30 days after they are received. Not later than 60 days after publication, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall begin a hearing at which interested persons are given an opportunity for oral and written presentations. Not later than 90 days after the hearing is completed and after consulting with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prescribe regulations as provided by this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) substantially the same as the proposed regulations submitted by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that amend the proposed regulations; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publish in the Federal Register&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a notice that no regulation is being prescribed in response to the proposed regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a detailed analysis of, and response to, all information the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency submitted with the proposed regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a detailed explanation of why no regulation is being prescribed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation and Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency believes that the action of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under subsection (c)(1)(B) or (2) of this section does not protect the public health and welfare from aircraft noise or sonic boom, consistent with the considerations in subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall consult with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and may request a report on the advisability of prescribing the regulation as originally proposed. The request, including a detailed statement of the information on which the request is based, shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall report to the Adminis<!-- PDFPage:738 -->trator of the Environmental Protection Agency within the time, if any, specified in the request. However, the time specified must be at least 90 days after the date of the request. The report shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be accompanied by a detailed statement of the findings of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the reasons for the findings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify any statement related to an action under subsection (c) of this section filed under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C));</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specify whether and where that statement is available for public inspection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be published in the Federal Register unless the request proposes specific action by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the report indicates that action will be taken.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Supplemental Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may request the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to file a supplemental report if the report under subsection (d) of this section indicates that the proposed regulations under subsection (c) of this section, for which a statement under section 102(2)(C) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required, should not be prescribed. The supplemental report shall be published in the Federal Register within the time the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency specifies. However, the time specified must be at least 90 days after the date of the request. The supplemental report shall contain a comparison of the environmental effects, including those that cannot be avoided, of the action of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the proposed regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An exemption from a standard or regulation prescribed under this section may be granted only if, before granting the exemption, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration consults with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. However, if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration finds that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires an exemption before the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency can be consulted, the exemption may be granted. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as soon as practicable after the exemption is granted.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security shall provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including United States mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles, that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft operated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier in air transportation or intrastate air transportation. In the case of flights and flight segments originating in the United States, the screening shall take place before boarding and shall be carried out by a Federal Government employee (as defined in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code), except as otherwise provided in section 44919 or 44920 and except for identifying passengers and baggage for screening under the CAPPS and known shipper programs and conducting positive bag-match programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Supervision of Screening</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All screening of passengers and property at airports in the United States where screening is required under this section shall be supervised by uniformed Federal personnel of the Transportation Security Administration who shall have the power to order the dismissal of any individual performing such screening.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Checked Baggage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A system must be in operation to screen all checked baggage at all airports in the United States as soon as practicable but not later than the 60th day following the date of enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Explosive Detection Systems.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#44901_1_target" name="44901_1">1</a></sup> <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security shall take all necessary action to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) explosive detection systems are deployed as soon as possible to ensure that all United States airports described in section 44903(c) have sufficient explosive detection systems to screen all checked baggage no later than December 31, 2002, and that as soon as such systems are in place at an airport, all checked baggage at the airport is screened by those systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all systems deployed under subparagraph (A) are fully utilized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if explosive detection equipment at an airport is unavailable, all checked baggage is screened by an alternative means.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Mandatory Screening Where EDS Not Yet Available</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As soon as practicable but not later than the 60th day following the date of enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and until the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(A) are met, the Under Secretary shall require alternative means for screening any piece of checked baggage that is not screened by an explosive detection system. Such alternative means may include 1 or more of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A bag-match program that ensures that no checked baggage is placed aboard an aircraft unless the passenger who checked the baggage is aboard the aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Manual search.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Search by canine explosive detection units in combination with other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Other means or technology approved by the Under Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Cargo Deadline</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A system must be in operation to screen, inspect, or otherwise ensure the security of all cargo that is to be transported in all-cargo aircraft in air transportation and intrastate air transportation as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Deployment of Armed Personnel.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary shall order the deployment of law enforcement personnel authorized to carry firearms at each airport security screening location to ensure passenger safety and national security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Minimum requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except at airports required to enter into agreements under subsection (c), the Under Secretary shall order the deployment of at least 1 law enforcement officer at each airport security screening location. At the 100 largest airports in the United States, in terms of annual passenger enplanements for the most recent calendar year for which data are available, the Under Secretary shall order the deployment of additional law enforcement personnel at airport security screening locations if the Under Secretary determines that the additional deployment is necessary to ensure passenger safety and national security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions and Advising Congress on Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may exempt from this section air transportation operations, except scheduled passenger operations of an air carrier providing air transportation under a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title or a permit issued under section 41302 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall advise Congress of a regulation to be prescribed under this section at least 30 <!-- PDFPage:750 -->days before the effective date of the regulation, unless the Under Secretary decides an emergency exists requiring the regulation to become effective in fewer than 30 days and notifies Congress of that decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to carry firearms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to make arrests without warrant for an offense against the United States committed in the presence of the individual or for a felony under the laws of the United States, if the individual reasonably believes the individual to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exclusive Responsibility Over Passenger Safety</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary has the exclusive responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to the safety of passengers on an aircraft involved in an offense under section 46502 of this title from the moment all external doors of the aircraft are closed following boarding until those doors are opened to allow passengers to leave the aircraft. When requested by the Under Secretary, other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Govern<!-- PDFPage:754 -->ment shall provide assistance necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Government and Industry Consortia</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary may establish at airports such consortia of government and aviation industry representatives as the Under Secretary may designate to provide advice on matters related to aviation security and safety.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Deployment and Purchase of Equipment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A deployment or purchase of explosive detection equipment under section 108.7(b)(8) or 108.20 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or similar regulation is required only if the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security certifies that the equipment alone, or as part of an integrated system, can detect under realistic air carrier operating conditions the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that would likely be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft. The Under Secretary shall base the certification <!-- PDFPage:768 -->on the results of tests conducted under protocols developed in consultation with expert scientists outside of the Transportation Security Administration. Those tests shall be completed not later than April 16, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before completion of the tests described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, but not later than April 16, 1992, the Under Secretary may require deployment of explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) if the Under Secretary decides that deployment will enhance aviation security significantly. In making that decision, the Under Secretary shall consider factors such as the ability of the equipment alone, or as part of an integrated system, to detect under realistic air carrier operating conditions the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that would likely be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft. The Under Secretary shall notify the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives of a deployment decision made under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Until such time as the Under Secretary determines that equipment certified under paragraph (1) is commercially available and has successfully completed operational testing as provided in paragraph (1), the Under Secretary shall facilitate the deployment of such approved commercially available explosive detection devices as the Under Secretary determines will enhance aviation security significantly. The Under Secretary shall require that equipment deployed under this paragraph be replaced by equipment certified under paragraph (1) when equipment certified under paragraph (1) becomes commercially available. The Under Secretary is authorized, based on operational considerations at individual airports, to waive the required installation of commercially available equipment under paragraph (1) in the interests of aviation security. The Under Secretary may permit the requirements of this paragraph to be met at airports by the deployment of dogs or other appropriate animals to supplement equipment for screening passengers, baggage, mail, or cargo for explosives or weapons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not prohibit the Under Secretary from purchasing or deploying explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may provide grants to continue the Explosive Detection K-9 Team Training Program to detect explosives at airports and on aircraft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after <!-- PDFPage:787 -->being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the confidentiality of test results and medical information (except information about alcohol or a controlled substance) of employees, except that this clause does not prevent the use of test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions under this chapter; and</p>

<!-- PDFPage:805 --><p class="note-body">The text of 49 App.:1473(b)(4) is omitted because of 28:ch. 131. The words &ldquo;imposed or assessed&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.

The words &ldquo;regardless of the place an aircraft in a civil action in rem is seized&rdquo; are substituted for 49 App.:1473(b)(1) (last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words. The word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; is added after &ldquo;involving a&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;(except a penalty imposed by the Secretary of Transportation that formerly was imposed by the Civil Aeronautics Board)&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;other than those assessed by the Board&rdquo; because the Civil Aeronautics Board went out of existence and its duties and powers were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
