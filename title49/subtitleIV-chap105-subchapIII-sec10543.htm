<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Notwithstanding any provision of this section or of section 902 of this title&rdquo; in 49:903(f) are omitted as surplus because section 10541 of the revised title codifies the pertinent provisions of 49:902 and 903, and section 10541 begins with the words &ldquo;Subject to&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsections (a) and (b), before each clause (1), the words &ldquo;does not have jurisdiction under this subchapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the provisions of this chapter shall not apply&rdquo; for clarity and to conform to the terms used in chapter 105 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;over transportation by water&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
