June 30, 1968, 82 Stat. 1369) provided that the Secretary retained the authority to make grants under section 11 of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (Public Law 88&ndash;365, 78 Stat. 302), as added by section 2(a)(2) of the Act of September 8, 1966 (Public Law 89&ndash;562, 80 Stat. 716) [subsequently changed to the Federal Transit Act by section 303(a) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 2087)] that primarily concerned the relationship of urban transportation systems to the planned development of urban areas or the role of transportation planning in overall urban planning. However, section 11(c) of the Federal Transit Act is not concerned with urban planning and the Secretary is not involved in making grants under section 11(c).</p>
