<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rates, including divisions of joint rates, and classifications for transportation and service it may provide under this subtitle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) rules and practices on matters related to that transportation or service, including rules and practices on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issuing tickets, receipts, bills of lading, and manifests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) carrying of baggage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the manner and method of presenting, marking, packing, and delivering property for transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) facilities for transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A contract carrier, except a motor contract carrier of property, providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall establish, and file with the Commission, actual and minimum rates for the transportation it may provide under this subtitle and rules and practices related to those rates. However, this subsection does not require a motor contract carrier to maintain the same rates and rules related to those rates for the same transportation provided to shippers served by it. The Commission may grant relief from this subsection when relief is consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a contract carrier or group of contract carriers or on its own initiative for a water contract carrier or group of water contract carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contracts of Carriage for Motor Contract Carriers.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A motor contract carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall enter into a written agreement, separate from the bill of lading or receipt, for each contract for the provision of transportation subject to such jurisdiction which is entered into after the 90th day following the date of the enactment of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Minimum content requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The written agreement shall, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify the parties thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) commit the shipper to tender and the carrier to transport a series of shipments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) contain the contract rate or rates for the transportation service to be or being provided; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) state that it provides for the assignment of motor vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of the shipper; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) state that it provides that the service is designed to meet the distinct needs of the shipper.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Retention by carrier</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All written agreements entered into by a motor contract carrier under paragraph (1) shall be retained by the carrier while in effect and for a minimum period of 3 years thereafter and shall be made available to the Commission upon request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Random audits by commission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall conduct periodic random audits to ensure that motor contract carriers are complying with this subsection and are adhering to the rates set forth in their agreements.</p>
