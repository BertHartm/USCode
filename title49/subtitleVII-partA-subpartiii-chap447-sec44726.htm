<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection and subsection (e)(2), the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may not issue a certificate under this chapter to any person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) convicted in a court of law of a violation of a law of the United States relating to the installation, production, repair, or sale of a counterfeit or fraudulently-represented aviation part or material;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whose certificate is revoked under subsection (b); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Administrator may issue a certificate under this chapter to a person described in paragraph (1) if issuance of the certificate will facilitate law enforcement efforts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocation of Certificate.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsections (f) and (g), the Administrator shall issue an order revoking a certificate issued under this chapter if the Administrator finds that the holder of the certificate or an individual who has a controlling or ownership interest in the holder&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was convicted in a court of law of a violation of a law of the United States relating to the installation, production, repair, or sale of a counterfeit or fraudulently-represented aviation part or material; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) knowingly, and with the intent to defraud, carried out or facilitated an activity punishable under a law described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>No authority to review violation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out paragraph (1), the Administrator may not review whether a person violated a law described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b), the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) advise the holder of the certificate of the reason for the revocation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to be heard on why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appeal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The provisions of section 44710(d) apply to the appeal of a revocation order under subsection (b). For the purpose of applying that section to the appeal, &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;individual&rdquo; each place it appears.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acquittal or Reversal.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not revoke, and the National Transportation Safety Board may not affirm a revocation of, a certificate under subsection (b)(1)(B) if the holder of the certificate or the individual referred to in subsection (b)(1) is acquitted of all charges directly related to the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Reissuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may reissue a certificate revoked under subsection (b) of this section to the former holder if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the former holder otherwise satisfies the requirements of this chapter for the certificate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) the former holder or the individual referred to in subsection (b)(1), is acquitted of all charges related to the violation on which the revocation was based; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the conviction of the former holder or such individual of the violation on which the revocation was based is reversed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may waive revocation of a certificate under subsection (b) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a law enforcement official of the United States Government requests a waiver; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the waiver will facilitate law enforcement efforts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Amendment of Certificate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the holder of a certificate issued under this chapter is other than an individual and the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an individual who had a controlling or ownership interest in the holder committed a violation of a law for the violation of which a certificate may be revoked under this section or knowingly, and with intent to defraud, carried out or facilitated an activity punishable under such a law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the holder satisfies the requirements for the certificate without regard to that individual,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the Administrator may amend the certificate to impose a limitation that the certificate will not be valid if that individual has a controlling or ownership interest in the holder. A decision by the Administrator under this subsection is not reviewable by the Board.</p>
