<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assembling rates and related classifications and rules for transportation of less-than-carload or less-than-truckload shipments to a place for further movement as part of a carload or truckload shipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) distribution rates and related classifications and rules for transportation of less-than-carload or less-than-truckload shipments moving from a place to which those shipments have moved as a part of a carload or truckload shipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A rate and related classification and rule established under subsection (a) of this section applies to household goods freight forwarders and other persons using common carrier transportation under like conditions and may differ from other rates and related classifications and rules that contemporaneously apply to the same common carrier transportation when the difference is justified by a difference in the respective conditions under which that transportation is used. A rate referred to in subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may not be established to cover the line-haul transportation between the principal concentration place and the principal break-bulk place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When establishing a rate, classification, rule, or practice, a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title may consider the type of property tendered to it by a household goods freight forwarder for transportation when the property is in parcels that do not exceed 70 pounds in weight or 100 inches in length and girth combined. The carrier may establish the lowest rate for the transportation that allows it to receive adequate compensation for transporting the property.</p>
