<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Compensatory Agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Rail freight and commuter rail passenger transportation provided under subsection (a)(3) of this section shall be provided under compensatory agreements with the responsible carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Compensation for Transportation Over Certain Rights of Way and Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An agreement under subsection (a)(6) of this section shall provide for reasonable reimbursement of costs but may not cross-subsidize intercity rail passenger, commuter rail passenger, and rail freight transportation.</p>

The Commission shall assign to a rail freight carrier obtaining transportation under this subsection the costs Amtrak incurs only for the benefit of the carrier, plus a proportionate share of all other costs of providing transportation under this paragraph incurred for the common benefit of Amtrak and the carrier. The proportionate share shall be based on relative measures of volume of car operations, tonnage, or other factors that reasonably reflect the relative use of rail property covered by this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:397 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection does not prevent the parties from making an agreement under subsection (a)(6) of this section after the Commission makes a decision under this subsection.</p>
