<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall have jurisdiction to make a determination of whether or not attempting to charge or the charging of a rate by a motor carrier or freight forwarder or party representing a motor carrier or freight forwarder is an unreasonable practice under subsection (a). If the Board determines that attempting to charge or the charging of the rate is an unreasonable practice under subsection (a), the carrier, freight forwarder, or party may not collect the difference described in subsection (a) between the applicable rate and the negotiated rate for the transportation service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Factors to consider</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a determination under paragraph (1), the Board shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the person was offered a transportation rate by the carrier or freight forwarder or party other than that legally on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board, as required, at the time of the movement for the transportation service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the person tendered freight to the carrier or freight forwarder in reasonable reliance upon the offered transportation rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the carrier or freight forwarder did not properly or timely file with the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board, as required, a tariff providing for such transportation rate or failed to enter into an agreement for contract carriage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether the transportation rate was billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) whether the carrier or freight forwarder or party demands additional payment of a higher rate filed in a tariff.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Stay of Additional Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a person proceeds under this section to challenge the reasonableness of the practice of a motor carrier, freight forwarder, or party described in subsection (a) to attempt to charge or to charge the difference described in subsection (a) between the applicable rate and the negotiated rate for the transportation service in addition to those charges already billed and collected for the transportation service, the person shall not have to pay any additional compensation to the carrier, freight forwarder, or party until the Board has made a determination as to the reasonableness of the practice as applied to the freight of the person against whom the claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Treatment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) is an exception to the requirements of section 13702 and, for transportation provided before January 1, 1996, to the requirements of sections 10761(a) and 10762, as in effect on December 31, 1995, as such sections relate to a filed tariff rate and other general tariff requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplicability of Negotiated Rate Dispute Resolution Procedure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person elects to seek enforcement of subsection (a) with respect to a rate for a transportation or service, section 13709 shall not apply to such rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;negotiated rate&rdquo; means a rate, charge, classification, or rule agreed upon by a motor carrier or freight forwarder and a shipper through negotiations pursuant to which no tariff was lawfully and timely filed and for which there is written evidence of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Applicability to Pending Cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section shall apply to all cases and proceedings pending on January 1, 1996.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Limited Modification to Moratorium on Issuance of Certificates or Permits With Respect to Mexico</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 6, 1993, 58 F.R. 27647, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 [Pub. L. 97&ndash;261, see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)] imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country. The Act [Pub. L. 97&ndash;261, see Tables for classification] authorized the President to remove the moratorium in whole or in part for any country or political subdivision thereof upon determining that such action is in the national interest. Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am pleased that an agreement between the United States and Mexico has been concluded to ensure fair and reciprocal treatment for charter and tour bus interests on both sides of the border. The agreement reached, however, does not allow for full access to cross-border and domestic markets. Therefore, the moratorium must reflect the conditions under which operating authority may be issued to Mexican charter and tour companies under the agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(2)(A)], I hereby make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or special operations, in foreign commerce, in round trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States pursuant to the following restrictions:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The Mexican motor carrier can conduct cross-border charter or special service in the United States only when the international tour or charter begins in Mexico;</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Tickets or tour packages for such operations cannot be sold in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The terms of the grants of authority given to Mexican motor carriers will be limited by the life of the agreement with Mexico covering reciprocal cross-border charter and special operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This action applies only to international charter and tour operations, does not allow for point-to-point service within the United States, and does not authorize companies to conduct cross-border regular route service. This action preserves the status quo with respect to Mexican trucking companies and Mexican companies engaged in regular route service, and will maintain the moratorium on those operations through September 25, 1994, unless earlier revoked or modified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, you are directed to notify the Congress today on my behalf that, effective 60 days hence, the moratorium will no longer be in effect for Mexican charter and tour bus companies subject to the above stated conditions. Because of this action, the Interstate Commerce Commission will then accept and process expeditiously all applications for operating authority from Mexican owned, controlled, or domiciled charter and tour bus firms. I should note that applications in Mexico by United States charter and tour bus firms will be similarly treated.</p>

<p class="note-body">As set forth in the Statement of Administrative Action regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that I submitted to the Congress on November 3, 1993, the moratorium with respect to Mexico will be lifted in phases to coincide with the schedule of liberalization in the relevant provisions of the NAFTA. The NAFTA specifically states that the moratorium will not apply to the provision of cross-border charter or tour bus services as of the date of entry into force of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">This is to give public notice that, pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(2)(A)], on November 3, 1993, I gave the Congress notice of my intention to make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by, persons of Mexico. This modification will take effect on January 1, 1994, the 60th day after my notice to the Congress.</p>

The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA) [ICC Termination Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104&ndash;88, see Tables for classification] maintained these restrictions, subject to modifications made prior to the enactment of the ICCTA [Dec. 29, 1995], and authorized the President to make further modifications to the moratorium. The relevant provisions of the ICCTA are codified at 49 U.S.C. 13902.</p>
<p class="note-body">The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) established a schedule for liberalizing certain restrictions on investment in truck and bus services. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13902(c)(3), I have determined that the following modifications to the moratorium are consistent with obligations of the United States under NAFTA and with U.S. transportation policy, and that the moratorium shall be modified accordingly. First, enterprises domiciled in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons of Mexico will be allowed to obtain operating authority to provide truck services for the transportation of international cargo between points in the United States. Second, enterprises domiciled in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons of Mexico will be allowed to obtain operating authority to provide bus services between points in the United States.

<p class="note-body">Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13902(c)(5), I have determined that expeditious action is required to implement these modifications to the moratorium. Effective today, the Department of Transportation will accept and expeditiously process applications, submitted by enterprises domiciled in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons of Mexico, to obtain operating authority to provide truck services for the transportation of international cargo between points in the United States or to provide bus services between points in the United States.</p>

The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), Public Law 104&ndash;88, 109 Stat. 803 [ICC Termination Act of 1995, see Tables for classification], maintained these restrictions, subject to modifications made prior to the enactment of the ICCTA [Dec. 29, 1995], and empowered the President to make further modifications to the moratorium.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13902(c)(3), I modified the moratorium on June 5, 2001, to allow motor carriers domiciled in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons of Mexico to obtain operating authority to transport international cargo by truck between points in the United States and to provide bus services between points in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) established a schedule for liberalizing certain restrictions on the provision of bus and truck services by Mexican-domiciled motor carriers in the United States.

<p class="note-body">First, qualified motor carriers domiciled in Mexico will be allowed to obtain operating authority to transport passengers in cross-border scheduled bus services. Second, qualified motor carriers domiciled in Mexico will be allowed to obtain operating authority to provide cross-border truck services. The moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to Mexican-domiciled motor carriers for the provision of truck or bus services between points in the United States will remain in place.

<p class="note-body">Furthermore, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13902(c)(5), I hereby determine that expeditious action is required to implement this modification to the moratorium. Effective on the date of this memorandum, the Department of Transportation is authorized to act on applications, submitted by motor carriers domiciled in Mexico, to obtain operating authority to provide cross-border scheduled bus services and cross-border truck services. In reviewing such applications, the Department shall continue to work closely with the Department of Justice, the Office of Homeland Security, and other relevant Federal departments, agencies, and offices in order to help ensure the security of the border and to prevent potential threats to national security.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:341 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Liability insurance requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may register a motor carrier under section 13902 only if the registrant files with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary, in an amount not less than such amount as the Secretary prescribes pursuant to, or as is required by, sections 31138 and 31139, and the laws of the State or States in which the registrant is operating, to the extent applicable. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the registrant for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles, or for loss or damage to property (except property referred to in paragraph (3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13906_1_target" name="13906_1">1</a></sup> of this subsection), or both. A registration remains in effect only as long as the registrant continues to satisfy the security requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Security requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of the Unified Carrier Registration Act of 2005, any person, other than a motor private carrier, registered with the Secretary to provide transportation or service as a motor carrier under section 13905(b) shall file with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary, in an amount not less than required by sections 31138 and 31139.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Agency requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A motor carrier shall comply with the requirements of sections 13303 and 13304. To protect the public, the Secretary may require any such motor carrier to file the type of security that a motor carrier is required to file under paragraph (1) of this subsection. This paragraph only applies to a foreign motor private carrier and foreign motor carrier operating in the United States to the extent that such carrier is providing transportation between places in a foreign country or between a place in one foreign country and a place in another foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Transportation insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may require a registered motor carrier to file with the Secretary a type of security sufficient to pay a shipper or consignee for damage to property of the shipper or consignee placed in the possession of the motor carrier as the result of transportation provided under this part. A carrier required by law to pay a shipper or consignee for loss, damage, or default for which a connecting motor carrier is responsible is subrogated, to the extent of the amount paid, to the rights of the shipper or consignee under any such security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Broker Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may register a person as a broker under section 13904 only if the person files with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary to ensure that the transportation for which a broker arranges is provided. The registration remains in effect only as long as the broker continues to satisfy the security requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Freight Forwarder Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Liability insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may register a person as a freight forwarder under section 13903 of this title only if the person files with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the freight forwarder for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual, or loss of, or damage to, property (other than property referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection), resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles by or under the direction and control of the freight forwarder when providing transfer, collection, or delivery service under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Freight forwarder insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may require a registered freight forwarder to file with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for loss of, or damage to, property for which the freight forwarder provides service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Effective period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The freight forwarder's registration remains in effect only as long as the freight forwarder continues to satisfy the security requirements of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Type of Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may determine the type and amount of security filed under this section. A motor carrier may submit proof of qualifications as a self-insurer to satisfy the security requirements of this section. The Secretary shall adopt regulations governing the standards for approval as a self-insurer. Motor carriers which have been granted authority to self-insure as of January 1, 1996, shall retain that authority unless, for good cause shown and after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds that the authority must be revoked.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Notice of Cancellation of Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue regulations requiring the submission to the Secretary of notices of insurance cancellation sufficiently in advance of actual cancellation so as to enable the Secretary to promptly revoke the registration of any carrier or broker after the effective date of the cancellation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Form of Endorsement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall also prescribe the appropriate form of endorsement to be appended to policies of insurance and surety bonds which will subject the insurance policy or surety bond to the full security limits of the coverage required under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Carriers Responsible for Agents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each motor carrier providing transportation of household goods shall be responsible for all acts or omissions of any of its agents which relate to the performance of household goods transportation services (including accessorial or terminal services) and which are within the actual or apparent authority of the agent from the carrier or which are ratified by the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Standard for Selecting Agents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each motor carrier providing transportation of household goods shall use due diligence and reasonable care in selecting and maintaining agents who are sufficiently knowledgeable, fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) and to fulfill the obligations imposed upon them by this part and by such carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Complaint</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe from a complaint or investigation that an agent providing household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) under the authority of a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods has violated section 14901(e) or 14912 or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), the Secretary may issue to such agent a complaint stating the charges and containing notice of the time and place of a hearing which shall be held no later than 60 days after service of the complaint to such agent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Right to defend</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agent shall have the right to appear at such hearing and rebut the charges contained in the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the agent does not appear at the hearing or if the Secretary finds that the agent has violated section 14901(e) or 14912 or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), the Secretary may issue an order to compel compliance with the requirement that the agent be fit, willing, and able. Thereafter, the Secretary may issue an order to limit, condition, or prohibit such agent from any involvement in the transportation or provision of services incidental to the transportation of household goods if, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds that such agent, within a reasonable time after the date of issuance of a compliance order under this section, but in no event less than 30 days after such date of issuance, has willfully failed to comply with such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon filing of a petition with the Secretary by an agent who is the subject of an order issued pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection and after notice, a hearing shall be held with an opportunity to be heard.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Court review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any agent adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Secretary issued under this subsection may seek relief in the appropriate United States court of appeals as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Applicability of Antitrust Laws.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to discussions or agreements between a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods and its agents (whether or not an agent is also a carrier) related solely to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) rates for the transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) accessorial, terminal, storage, or other charges for services incidental to the transportation of household goods transported under the authority of the principal carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) allowances relating to transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:343 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ownership of a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods by an agent or membership on the board of directors of any such motor carrier by an agent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Board review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board, upon its own initiative or request, shall review any activities undertaken under paragraph (1) and shall modify or terminate the activity if necessary to protect the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Household goods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;household goods&rdquo; has the meaning such term had under section 10102(11) of this title, as in effect on December 31, 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; means transportation that would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, as in effect on December 31, 1995, if such subchapter were still in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Standards for Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board may approve and authorize an agreement or combination between or among motor carriers of passengers, or between a motor carrier of passengers and a rail carrier of passengers if the carriers involved assent to the pooling or division and the Board finds that a pooling or division of traffic, services, or earnings&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy of operation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will not unreasonably restrain competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedure.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Determination of importance and restraint on competition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Prior to the effective date of the agreement or combination, the Board shall determine whether the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance and whether there is substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition. If the Board determines that neither of these 2 factors exists, it shall, prior to such effective date and without a hearing, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Board may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Board to be just and reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Board determines either that the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance or that there is substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition, the Board shall hold a hearing concerning whether the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and whether it will unduly restrain competition and shall suspend operation of such agreement or combination pending such hearing and final decision thereon. After such hearing, the Board shall indicate to what extent it finds that the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and will not unduly restrain competition and if assented to by all the carriers involved, shall to that extent, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Board may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Board to be just and reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Special rules for household goods carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of an application for Board approval of an agreement or combination between a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods and its agents to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings, such agreement or combination shall be presumed to be in the interest of better service to the public and of economy in operation and not to restrain competition unduly if the practices proposed to be carried out under such agreement or combination are the same as or similar to practices carried out under agreements and combinations between motor carriers providing transportation of household goods to pool or divide traffic or service of any part of their earnings approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission before January 1, 1996.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:349 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Streamlining and simplifying</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall streamline, simplify, and expedite, to the maximum extent practicable, the process (including any paperwork) for submission and approval of applications under this section for agreements and combinations between motor carriers providing transportation of household goods and their agents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board may impose conditions governing the pooling or division and may approve and authorize payment of a reasonable consideration between the carriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A carrier may participate in an arrangement approved by or exempted by the Board under this section without the approval of any other Federal, State, or municipal body. A carrier participating in an approved or exempted arrangement is exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the arrangement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Approval Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The following transactions involving motor carriers of passengers subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 may be carried out only with the approval of the Board:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Consolidation or merger of the properties or franchises of at least 2 carriers into one operation for the ownership, management, and operation of the previously separately owned properties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A purchase, lease, or contract to operate property of another carrier by any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Standard for Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall approve and authorize a transaction under this section when it finds the transaction is consistent with the public interest. The Board shall consider at least the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Board may impose conditions governing the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Completeness of Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 30 days after the date on which an application is filed under this section, the Board shall either publish a notice of the application in the Federal Register or reject the application if it is incomplete.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Deadlines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall conclude evidentiary proceedings by the 240th day after the date on which notice of the application is published under subsection (c). The Board shall issue a final decision by the 180th day after the conclusion of the evidentiary proceedings. The Board may extend a time period under this sub<!-- PDFPage:350 -->section; except that the total of all such extensions with respect to any application shall not exceed 90 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A carrier or corporation participating in or resulting from a transaction approved by the Board under this section, or exempted by the Board from the application of this section pursuant to section 13541, may carry out the transaction, own and operate property, and exercise control or franchises acquired through the transaction without the approval of a State authority.

<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section shall not apply to transactions involving carriers whose aggregate gross operating revenues were not more than $2,000,000 during a period of 12 consecutive months ending not more than 6 months before the date of the agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Certain Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Board approves and authorizes a transaction under this section in which a person not a carrier providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 acquires control of at least 1 carrier subject to such jurisdiction, the person is subject, as a carrier, to the following provisions of this title that apply to the carrier being acquired by that person, to the extent specified by the Board: sections 504(f), 14121&ndash;14123, 14901(a), and 14907.</p>

Transportation provided by a motor carrier under a grant of approval under this subsection is subject to this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Supplemental Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When cause exists, the Board may issue appropriate orders supplemental to an order made in a proceeding under this section.</p>

When a State registration requirement imposes obligations in excess of the standards of the Secretary, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Evidence of federal registration; proof of insurance; payment of fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under the standards of the Secretary implementing the single State registration system described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, only a State acting in its capacity as registration State under such single State system may require a motor carrier registered by the Secretary under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to file and maintain evidence of such Federal registration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to file satisfactory proof of required insurance or qualification as a self-insurer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to pay directly to such State fee amounts in accordance with the fee system established under subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph, subject to allocation of fee revenues among all States in which the carrier operates and which participate in the single State registration system; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Receipts; fee system</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The standards of the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall require that copies of the receipt issued under clause (i) of this subparagraph be kept in each of the carrier's commercial motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not require decals, stamps, cab cards, or any other means of registering or identifying specific vehicles operated by the carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) shall establish a fee system for the filing of proof of insurance as provided under subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is based on the number of commercial motor vehicles the carrier operates in a State and on the number of States in which the carrier operates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) minimizes the costs of complying with the registration system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) results in a fee for each participating State that is equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) shall not authorize the charging or collection of any fee for filing and maintaining evidence of Federal registration under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement of order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person injured because a carrier or broker providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 does not obey an order of the Secretary or the Board, as applicable, under this part, except an order for the payment of money, may bring a civil action to enforce that order under this subsection. A person may bring a civil action for injunctive relief for violations of sections 14102 and 14103.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Damages for violations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A carrier or broker providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 is liable for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of that carrier or broker in violation of this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Liability and Damages for Exceeding Tariff Rate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 is liable to a person for amounts charged that exceed the applicable rate for transportation or service contained in a tariff in effect under section 13702.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Election.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Complaint to dot or board; civil action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person may file a complaint with the Board or the Secretary, as applicable, under <!-- PDFPage:361 -->section 14701(b) or bring a civil action under subsection (b) to enforce liability against a carrier or broker providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Order of dot or board.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Board or Secretary, as applicable, makes an award under subsection (b) of this section, the Board or Secretary, as applicable, shall order the carrier to pay the amount awarded by a specific date. The Board or Secretary, as applicable, may order a carrier or broker providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 to pay damages only when the proceeding is on complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement by civil action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The person for whose benefit an order of the Board or Secretary requiring the payment of money is made may bring a civil action to enforce that order under this paragraph if the carrier or broker does not pay the amount awarded by the date payment was ordered to be made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Procedure.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a person begins a civil action under subsection (b) of this section to enforce an order of the Board or Secretary requiring the payment of damages by a carrier or broker providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 of this title, the text of the order of the Board or Secretary must be included in the complaint. In addition to the district courts of the United States, a State court of general jurisdiction having jurisdiction of the parties has jurisdiction to enforce an order under this paragraph. The findings and order of the Board or Secretary are competent evidence of the facts stated in them. Trial in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States under this paragraph is in the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides or in which the principal operating office of the carrier or broker is located. In a civil action under this paragraph, the plaintiff is liable for only those costs that accrue on an appeal taken by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Parties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All parties in whose favor the award was made may be joined as plaintiffs in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States under this subsection and all the carriers that are parties to the order awarding damages may be joined as defendants. Trial in the action is in the judicial district in which any one of the plaintiffs could bring the action against any one of the defendants. Process may be served on a defendant at its principal operating office when that defendant is not in the district in which the action is brought. A judgment ordering recovery may be made in favor of any of those plaintiffs against the defendant found to be liable to that plaintiff.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Attorney's Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The district court shall award a reasonable attorney's fee under this section. The district court shall tax and collect that fee as part of the costs of the action.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Liability.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Motor carriers and freight forwarders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this part. That carrier and any other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 or chapter 105 are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this paragraph is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by (A) the receiving carrier, (B) the delivering carrier, or (C) another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading and, except in the case of a freight forwarder, applies to property reconsigned or diverted under a tariff under section 13702. Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a carrier. A delivering carrier is deemed to be the carrier performing the line-haul transportation nearest the destination but does not include a carrier providing only a switching service at the destination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Freight forwarder</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A freight forwarder is both the receiving and delivering carrier. When a freight forwarder provides service and uses a motor carrier providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 to receive property from a consignor, the motor carrier may execute the bill of lading or shipping receipt for the freight forwarder with its consent. With the consent of the freight forwarder, a motor carrier may deliver property for a freight forwarder on the freight forwarder's bill of lading, freight bill, or shipping receipt to the consignee named in it, and receipt for the property may be made on the freight forwarder's delivery receipt.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Apportionment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The carrier issuing the receipt or bill of lading under subsection (a) of this section or delivering the property for which the receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to recover from the carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury occurred the amount required to be paid to the owners of the property, as evidenced by a receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the amount of its expenses reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Special Rules.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Motor carriers.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Shipper waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), a carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 may, subject to the provisions of this chapter (including with respect to a motor carrier, the requirements of section 13710(a)), establish rates for the transportation of property (other than household goods described in section 13102(10)(A)) under which the liability of the carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written or electronic declaration of the shipper or by written agreement between the carrier and shipper if that value would be reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) communications received from a carrier's insurer shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the insurer, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed, provides reason for such disallowance, and informs the claimant that the insurer is acting on behalf of the carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;14708. Dispute settlement program for household goods carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Offering Shippers Arbitration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As a condition of registration under section 13902 or 13903, a carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 must agree to offer in accordance with this section to shippers of household goods arbitration as a means of settling disputes between such carriers and shippers of household goods concerning damage or loss to the household goods transported and to determine whether carrier charges, in addition to those collected at delivery, must be paid by shippers for transportation and services related to transportation of household goods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Arbitration Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Prevention of special advantage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The arbitration that is offered must be designed to prevent a carrier from having any special advantage in any case in which the claimant resides or does business at a place distant from the carrier's principal or other place of business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Notice of arbitration procedure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The carrier must provide the shipper an adequate notice of the availability of neutral arbitration, including a concise easy-to-read, accurate summary of the arbitration procedure, any applicable costs, and disclosure of the legal effects of election to utilize arbitration. Such notice must be given to persons for whom household goods are to be transported by the carrier before such goods are tendered to the carrier for transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Provision of forms</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon request of a shipper, the carrier must promptly provide such forms and other information as are necessary for initiating an action to resolve a dispute under arbitration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Independence of arbitrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each person authorized to arbitrate or otherwise settle disputes must be independent of the parties to the dispute and must be capable, as determined under such regulations as the Secretary may issue, to resolve such disputes fairly and expeditiously. The carrier must ensure that each person chosen to settle the disputes is authorized and able to obtain from the shipper or carrier any material and relevant information to the extent necessary to carry out a fair and expeditious decisionmaking process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Apportionment of costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No shipper may be charged more than half of the cost for instituting an arbitration proceeding that is brought under this section. In the decision, the arbitrator may determine which party shall pay the cost or a portion of the cost of the arbitration proceeding, including the cost of instituting the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Requests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The carrier must not require the shipper to agree to utilize arbitration prior to the time that a dispute arises. If the dispute involves a claim for $10,000 or less and the shipper requests arbitration, such arbitration shall be binding on the parties. If the dispute involves a claim for more than $10,000 and the shipper requests arbitration, such arbitration shall be binding on the parties only if the carrier agrees to arbitration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Oral presentation of evidence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The arbitrator may provide for an oral presentation of a dispute concerning transportation of household goods by a party to the dispute (or a party's representative), but such oral presentation may be made only if all parties to the dispute expressly agree to such presentation and the date, time, and location of such presentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Deadline for decision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The arbitrator must, as expeditiously as possible but at least within 60 days of receipt of written notification of the dispute, render a decision based on the information gathered; except that, in any case in which a party to the dispute fails to provide in a timely manner any information concerning such dispute which the person settling the dispute may reasonably require to resolve the dispute, the arbitrator may extend such 60-day period for a reasonable period of time. A decision resolving a dispute may include any remedies appropriate under the circumstances, including repair, replacement, refund, reimbursement for expenses, compensation for damages, and an order requiring the payment of additional carrier charges.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Use of Materials</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Materials and information obtained in the course of a decision making process to settle a dispute by arbitration under this section may not be used to bring an action under section 14905.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Attorney's Fees to Shippers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 concerning the transportation of household goods by such carrier, the shipper shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the shipper submits a claim to the carrier within 120 days after the date the shipment is delivered or the date the delivery is scheduled, whichever is later;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the shipper prevails in such court action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) the shipper was not advised by the carrier during the claim settlement process that a dispute settlement program was available to resolve the dispute;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a decision resolving the dispute was not rendered through arbitration under this section within the period provided under subsection (b)(8) of this section or an extension of such period under such subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the court proceeding is to enforce a decision rendered through arbitration under this section and is instituted after the period for performance under such decision has elapsed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Attorney's Fees to Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a carrier providing transportation, or service subject to jurisdiction <!-- PDFPage:365 -->under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 concerning the transportation of household goods by such carrier, such carrier may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees by the court only if the shipper brought such action in bad faith&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after resolution of such dispute through arbitration under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after institution of an arbitration proceeding by the shipper to resolve such dispute under this section but before&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the period provided under subsection (b)(8) for resolution of such dispute (including, if applicable, an extension of such period under such subsection) ends; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a decision resolving such dispute is rendered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Limitation of Applicability to Collect-on-Delivery Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The provisions of this section shall apply only in the case of collect-on-delivery transportation of household goods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Review by Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 18 months after January 1, 1996, the Secretary shall complete a review of the dispute settlement program established under this section. If, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Secretary determines that changes are necessary to such program to ensure the fair and equitable resolution of disputes under this section, the Secretary shall implement such changes and transmit a report to Congress on such changes.</p>
