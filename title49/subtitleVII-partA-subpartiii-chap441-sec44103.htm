<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On application of the owner of an aircraft that meets the requirements of section 44102 of this title, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) register the aircraft; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) issue a certificate of registration to its owner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may prescribe the extent to which an aircraft owned by the holder of a dealer's certificate of registration issued under section 44104(2) of this title also is registered under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Controlled Substance Violations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator may not issue an owner's certificate of registration under subsection (a)(1) of this section to a person whose certificate is revoked under section 44106 of this title during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the revocation, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as provided in section 44106(e)(2) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the Administrator may issue the certificate to the person after the one-year period beginning on the date of the revocation if the Administrator decides that the aircraft otherwise meets the requirements of section 44102 of this title and that denial of a certificate for the 5-year period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) would be excessive considering the nature of the offense or the act committed and the burden the denial places on the person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) would not be in the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A decision of the Administrator under paragraph (1)(B)(i) or (ii) of this subsection is within the discretion of the Administrator. That decision or failure to make a decision is not subject to administrative or judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Certificates as Evidence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A certificate of registration issued under this section is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) conclusive evidence of the nationality of an aircraft for international purposes, but not conclusive evidence in a proceeding under the laws of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not evidence of ownership of an aircraft in a proceeding in which ownership is or may be in issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Certificates Available for Inspection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An operator of an aircraft shall make available for inspection a certificate of registration for the aircraft when requested by a United States Government, State, or local law enforcement officer.</p>
