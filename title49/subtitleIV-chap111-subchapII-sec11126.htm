<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall make a reasonable distribution of cars for transportation of coal among the coal mines served by it whether the mines are located on its line or are customarily dependent on it for car supply. If the supply of available cars does not equal the requirements of the mines, the carrier shall maintain and apply reasonable ratings of the mines and count each car furnished to or used by a mine for transportation of coal against that mine. However, coal cars supplied by shippers or receivers are deemed not to be a part of the carrier's fleet and are not counted in determining a question about distribution or car count under subsection (b) of this section or section 10102, 10501, 10701&ndash;10703, 10707, 10721(b), 10722(c)&ndash;(d), 10723(a)&ndash;(b)(1), 10724(a), 10741&ndash;10744, 10746, 10749, 10750, 10901, 10902, 10907, 11101, 11103&ndash;11105, 11121&ndash;11125, 11127, 11128(a)(1), 11501(f), 11505(a), 11702(a)(1), 11703, 11901(d)&ndash;(e)(2), 11902, 11903, 11905, 11907, 11915, or 11916 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;unit-train service&rdquo; means the movement of a single shipment of coal of at least 4,500 tons, tendered to one carrier, on one bill of lading, at one origin, on one day, and destined to one consignee, at one plant, at one destination, over one route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unit-train service and non-unit-train service are deemed to be separate and distinct classes of service. A distinction shall be made between them and between the cars used in each class of service. A question about the reasonableness of, or discrimination in, the distribution of cars shall be determined within each class and not between them, notwithstanding a section referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
