<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; for clarity and consistency because only a citizen of the United States may be an &ldquo;air carrier&rdquo; as defined in section 40102(a) of the revised title, and only an air carrier may be a &ldquo;charter air carrier&rdquo; as defined in section 40102(a). The word &ldquo;provide&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;perform&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;of public convenience and necessity&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;any part of&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the whole or any part of&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. In clauses (2) and (3), the words &ldquo;In the case of&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (3), the words &ldquo;for such periods&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the word &ldquo;comply&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;conform&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;properly&rdquo; and &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;rules&rdquo; is omitted as being synonymous with &ldquo;regulations&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; are added because 49 App.:1551(a)(1)(A) provides that 49 App.:1371(d)(1)&ndash;(3) no longer applies to interstate or overseas transportation of persons. After January 1, 1985, other interstate and overseas air transportation and the domestic air transportation of mail do not require a certificate of public convenience and necessity. See H. Rept. 98&ndash;793, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., p.10 (1984).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;issue a certificate&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;grant an application&rdquo; for consistency in this chapter. The words &ldquo;for interstate air transportation (except the transportation of passengers) or foreign air transportation&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency. The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the word &ldquo;prices&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rates, fares, charges&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;price&rdquo; in section 40102(a) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;in fact&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;to assess the impact of the new services on the national air route structure, or otherwise&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is added for clarity.</p>
