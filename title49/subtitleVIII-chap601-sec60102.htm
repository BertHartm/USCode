<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Safety Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe minimum safety standards for pipeline transportation and for pipeline facilities. The standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) apply to transporters of gas and hazardous liquid and to owners and operators of pipeline facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may apply to the design, installation, inspection, emergency plans and procedures, testing, construction, extension, operation, replacement, and maintenance of pipeline facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall include a requirement that all individuals responsible for the operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities be tested for qualifications and certified to operate and maintain those facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As the Secretary considers appropriate, the operator of a pipeline facility may make the certification under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection. Testing and certification under paragraph (1)(C) shall address the ability to recognize and react appropriately to abnormal operating conditions that may indicate a dangerous situation or a condition exceeding design limits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Practicability and Safety Needs Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall be practicable and designed to meet the need for gas pipeline safety, for safely transporting hazardous liquid, and for protecting the environment. Except as provided in section 60103 of this title, when prescribing the standard the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) relevant available&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) gas pipeline safety information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) hazardous liquid pipeline information;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the appropriateness of the standard for the particular type of pipeline transportation or facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the reasonableness of the standard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent to which the standard will contribute to public safety and the protection of the environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Public Safety Program Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall include in the standards prescribed under subsection (a) of this section a requirement that an operator of a gas pipeline facility participate in a public safety program that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notifies an operator of proposed demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction near or affecting the facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requires an operator to identify a pipeline facility that may be affected by the proposed demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction, to prevent damaging the facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary decides will protect a facility adequately against a hazard caused by demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the extent a public safety program referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection is not available, the Secretary shall prescribe standards requiring an operator to take action the Secretary prescribes to provide services comparable to services that would be available under a public safety program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may include in the standards prescribed under subsection (a) of this section a requirement that an operator of a hazardous liquid pipeline facility participate in a public safety program meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection or maintain and carry out a damage prevention program that provides services comparable to services that would be available under a public safety program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Facility Operation Information Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe minimum standards requiring an operator of a pipeline facility subject to this chapter to maintain, to the extent practicable, information related to operating the facility and, when requested, to provide the information to the Secretary and an appropriate State official. The information shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the business name, address, and telephone number, including an operations emergency telephone number, of the operator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) accurate maps and a supplementary geographic description, including an identification of areas described in regulations prescribed under section 60109 of this title, that show the location in the State of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) major gas pipeline facilities of the operator, including transmission lines and significant distribution lines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) major hazardous liquid pipeline facilities of the operator;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the characteristics of the operator's pipelines in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) products transported through the operator's pipelines in the State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the manual that governs operating and maintaining pipeline facilities in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an emergency response plan describing the operator's procedures for responding to and containing releases, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identifying specific action the operator will take on discovering a release;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) liaison procedures with State and local authorities for emergency response; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) communication and alert procedures for immediately notifying State and local officials at the time of a release; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) other information the Secretary considers useful to inform a State of the presence of pipeline facilities and operations in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Pipe Inventory Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe minimum standards requiring an operator of a pipeline facility subject to this chapter and, to the extent the Secretary considers necessary, an operator of a gathering line that is not a regulated gathering line (as defined under section 60101(b)(2) of this title), to maintain for the Secretary, to the extent practicable, an inventory with appropriate information about the types of pipe used for the trans<!-- PDFPage:719 -->mission of gas or hazardous liquid, as appropriate, in the operator's system and additional information, including the material's history and the leak history of the pipe. The inventory&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for a gas pipeline facility, shall include an identification of each facility passing through an area described in regulations prescribed under section 60109 of this title but shall exclude equipment used with the compression of gas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for a hazardous liquid pipeline facility, shall include an identification of each facility and gathering line passing through an area described in regulations prescribed under section 60109 of this title, whether the facility or gathering line otherwise is subject to this chapter, but shall exclude equipment associated only with the pipeline pumps or storage facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The Secretary may apply the standard to an existing gas or hazardous liquid transmission facility and require the facility to be changed to allow the facility to be inspected with an instrumented internal inspection device if the basic construction of the facility will accommodate the device.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than October 24, 1995, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring the periodic inspection of each pipeline the operator of the pipeline identifies under section 60109 of this title. The regulations shall include any circumstances under which an inspection shall be conducted with an instrumented internal inspection device and, if the device is not required, use of an inspection method that is at least as effective as using the device in providing for the safety of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Effective Dates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard prescribed under this section and section 60110 of this title is effective on the 30th day after the Secretary prescribes the standard. However, the Secretary for good cause may prescribe a different effective date when required because of the time reasonably necessary to comply with the standard. The different date must be specified in the regulation prescribing the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Safety Condition Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring each operator of a pipeline facility (except a master meter) to submit to the Secretary a written report on any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) condition that is a hazard to life, property, or the environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) safety-related condition that causes or has caused a significant change or restriction in the operation of a pipeline facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary must receive the report not later than 5 working days after a representative of a person to which this section applies first establishes that the condition exists. Notice of the condition shall be given concurrently to appropriate State authorities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Carbon Dioxide Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall regulate carbon dioxide transported by a hazardous liquid pipeline facility. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations related to hazardous liquid to ensure the safe transportation of carbon dioxide by such a facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Flow Restricting Devices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than October 24, 1994, the Secretary shall survey and assess the effectiveness of emergency flow restricting devices (including remotely controlled valves and check valves) and other procedures, systems, and equipment used to detect and locate hazardous liquid pipeline ruptures and minimize product releases from hazardous liquid pipeline facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 2 years after the survey and assessment are completed, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations on the circumstances under which an operator of a hazardous liquid pipeline facility must use an emergency flow restricting device or other procedure, system, or equipment described in paragraph (1) of this subsection on the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition Against Low Internal Stress Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not provide an exception to this chapter for a hazardous liquid pipeline facility only because the facility operates at low internal stress.</p>
