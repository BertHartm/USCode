<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Chains Instead of Drawbars</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A vehicle in a revenue train or in association with commercially-used vehicles may be moved under this section with chains instead of drawbars only when the vehicle contains livestock or perishable freight.</p>

The word &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;remedial action&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to ensure that administrative, as well as court proceedings, are included. The words &ldquo;to recover damages&rdquo; are added for clarity.
