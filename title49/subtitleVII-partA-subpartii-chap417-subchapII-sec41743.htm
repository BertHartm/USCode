<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Characteristics</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The airport presents characteristics, such as geographic diversity or unique circumstances, that will demonstrate the need for, and feasibility of, the program established under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>State limit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not more than 4 communities or consortia of communities, or a combination thereof, from the same State may be selected to participate in the program in any fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the assistance will provide material benefits to a broad segment of the travelling public, including business, educational institutions, and other enterprises, whose access to the national air transportation system is limited; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the assistance will be used in a timely fashion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Types of Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may use amounts made available under this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide assistance to an underserved airport to obtain service to and from the underserved airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide assistance to an underserved airport to implement such other measures as the Secretary, in consultation with such air<!-- PDFPage:761 -->port, considers appropriate to improve air service both in terms of the cost of such service to consumers and the availability of such service, including improving air service through marketing and promotion of air service and enhanced utilization of airport facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Make Agreements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may make agreements to provide assistance under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Designation of Responsible Official</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall designate an employee of the Department of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to function as a facilitator between small communities and air carriers;</p>
