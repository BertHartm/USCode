<p class="note-body">In the section, the words &ldquo;be the duty of&rdquo; before &ldquo;Secretary shall&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;inspect&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; as being more appropriate. The words &ldquo;person applying to the Interstate Commerce Commission for authority to provide transportation or freight forwarder service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;applicant seeking operating authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission&rdquo; as being more precise and to conform to subtitle IV of the revised title. The words &ldquo;of the inspection&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;person applying for permanent authority to provide transportation or freight forwarder service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;applicant for permanent operating authority&rdquo; as being more precise and to conform to subtitle IV of the revised title. The words &ldquo;proposed transfer of permanent authority&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;proposed transaction involving transfer of operating authority&rdquo; to eliminate surplus words and for clarity because the transfer only involves permanent authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;providing transportation or freight forwarder service subject to its jurisdiction&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c)(2) is substituted for 49:1653(e)(3) for clarity and to conform to subtitle IV of the revised title. The words &ldquo;freight forwarder service&rdquo; are not <!-- PDFPage:46 -->used because the law does not provide for temporary authority for freight forwarders.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(3) and (4), the word &ldquo;finding&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;determination&rdquo; to conform to subtitle IV of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(3), the words &ldquo;necessary or&rdquo; before &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
