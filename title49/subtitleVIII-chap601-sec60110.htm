<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standards shall provide that, except when installation is required under subsection (b) of this section, excess flow valves shall be installed at the request of the customer if the customer will pay all costs associated with installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary decides under subsection (b) of this section that there are no circumstances under which an operator must install excess flow valves, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the reasons for the decision not later than 30 days after the decision is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Performance Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than April 24, 1994, the Secretary shall develop standards for the performance of excess flow valves used to protect lines in a natural gas distribution system.
