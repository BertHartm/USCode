<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The rail carrier shall&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If no protest is received within 30 days after the application is filed, the Commission shall find that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance.

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If a protest is received within 30 days after the application is filed, the Commission shall, within 45 days after the application is filed, determine whether an investigation is needed to assist in determining what disposition to make of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission decides that no investigation is to be undertaken, the Commission shall, within 75 days after the application is filed, decide whether the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance, taking into consideration the application of the rail carrier and any materials submitted by protestants. If the Commission finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment, it shall, within 90 days after the date of application, issue a certificate which permits the abandonment or discontinu<!-- PDFPage:286 -->ance to occur within 120 days after the application is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Commission decides that an investigation should be undertaken under this section, the investigation must be completed within 135 days, and an initial decision must be rendered within 165 days, after the date the application is filed. Thirty days after such decision, the initial decision shall become the final decision of the Commission unless, during the interim, the Commission decides to hear appeals. If an initial decision is appealed and considered by the Commission, the Commission shall issue a final decision within 255 days after the date of application. Whenever the Commission decides upon investigation that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance of rail service, it shall, within 15 days of the final decision, issue a certificate which permits the abandonment or discontinuance to occur within 75 days of the date of the final decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The effective date of any certificate which permits abandonment or discontinuance may be stayed by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 10905 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The burden is on the person applying for the certificate to prove that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For applications approved by the Secretary of Transportation as part of a plan or proposal under section 333(a)&ndash;(d) of this title, the Commission shall consider whether any detriment from the abandonment or discontinuance exceeds the transportation benefit from the plan or proposal as a whole.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;potentially subject to abandonment&rdquo; has the meaning given the term in regulations of the Commission. The regulations may include standards that vary by region of the United States and by railroad or group of railroads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each rail carrier shall maintain a complete diagram of the transportation system operated, directly or indirectly, by the carrier. The carrier shall submit to the Commission and publish amendments to its diagram that are necessary to maintain the accuracy of the diagram. The diagram shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include a detailed description of each of its railroad lines potentially subject to abandonment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify each railroad line for which the carrier plans to file an application for a certificate under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an application for a certificate is opposed by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a shipper or other person that has made significant use (as determined by the Commission) of the railroad line involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance during the 12-month period before the filing of the application for a certificate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a State or political subdivision of a State in which any part of the railroad line is located;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission may issue a certificate under section 10903 of this title only if the railroad line has been described and identified in the diagram or amendment to the diagram of the rail carrier that was submitted to the Commission at least 4 months before the date on which the application was filed, except that the requirement of such description or identification in such diagram may be waived by the Commission if the application was approved by the Secretary of Transportation as part of a plan or proposal under section 333(a)&ndash;(d) of this title, or the application is filed by a railroad in bankruptcy.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10905. Offers of financial assistance to avoid abandonment and discontinuance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;avoidable cost&rdquo; means all expenses that would be incurred by a rail carrier in providing transportation that would not be incurred if the railroad line over which the transportation was provided were abandoned or if the transportation were discontinued. Expenses include cash inflows foregone and cash outflows incurred by the rail carrier as a result of not abandoning or discontinuing the transportation. Cash inflows foregone and cash outflows incurred include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) working capital and required capital expenditure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expenditures to eliminate deferred maintenance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the current cost of freight cars, locomotives, and other equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the foregone tax benefits from not retiring properties from rail service and other effects of applicable Federal and State income taxes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;reasonable return&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if a rail carrier is not in reorganization, the cost of capital to the rail carrier, as determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if a rail carrier is in reorganization, the mean cost of capital of rail carriers not in reorganization, as determined by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any rail carrier which has filed an application for a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance shall provide promptly to a party considering an offer of financial assistance and shall provide concurrently to the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an estimate of the annual subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line or a portion of the line in operation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) its most recent reports on the physical condition of that part of the railroad line involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the amount of annual financial assistance which would be required to continue rail transportation over that part of the railroad line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any other information that the Commission may deem necessary to allow a potential offeror to calculate an adequate subsidy or purchase offer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the Commission finds under section 10903 of this title that the public convenience and necessity require or permit abandonment or discontinuance of a particular railroad line, it shall, concurrently with service of the decision upon the parties, publish the finding in the Federal Register. Within 10 days following the publication, any person may offer to pay the carrier a subsidy or offer to purchase the line. Such offer shall be filed concurrently with the Commission. If the offer to subsidize or purchase the line is less than the carrier's estimate provided under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the offer shall explain the basis of the disparity, and the manner in which the offer of subsidy or purchase is calculated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If, within 15 days after the publication required in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:288 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority) has offered financial assistance to enable the rail transportation to be continued over that part of the railroad line to be abandoned or over which all rail transportation is to be discontinued; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is likely that the assistance would be equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the difference between the revenues attributable to that part of the railroad line and the avoidable cost of providing rail freight transportation on the line, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the acquisition cost of that part of the railroad line;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall postpone the issuance of a certificate authorizing abandonment or discontinuance in accordance with subsections (e) and (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the carrier and a person offering financial assistance enter into an agreement which will provide continued rail service, the Commission shall postpone the issuance of the certificate for so long as the agreement, or an extension or modification of the agreement, is in effect. If the carrier and a person offering to purchase a line enter into an agreement which will provide continued rail service, the Commission shall approve the transaction and dismiss the application for abandonment or discontinuance. If the carrier and a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority) fail to agree on the amount or terms of the subsidy or purchase, either party may, within 30 days after the offer is made, request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation. If no agreement is reached within 30 days after the offer is made and neither party requests that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation during that same period, the Commission shall immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Whenever the Commission is requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Commission shall render its decision within 60 days;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) where subsidy has been offered, the Commission shall determine the amount and terms of subsidy based on the avoidable cost of providing continued rail transportation, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) where an offer of purchase has been made in order to continue rail service on the line, the Commission shall determine the price and other terms of sale. In no case shall the Commission set a price which is below the fair market value of the line (including, unless otherwise mutually agreed, all facilities on the line or portion necessary to provide effective transportation services).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The decision of the Commission shall be binding on both parties, except that the person who has offered to subsidize or purchase the line may withdraw his offer within 10 days of the Commission's decision. In such a case, the Commission shall immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance, unless other offers are being considered pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a carrier receives more than one offer to purchase or subsidize, it shall select the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, and complete the sale or subsidy agreement, or request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation prior to the 40th day after the date on which notice was published under subsection (c) of this section. If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached within the 40-day period and the Commission has not been requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation, any other offeror may request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation. If the Commission has established the conditions and amount of compensation and the original offer has been withdrawn, any other offeror may accept the Commission's decision within 20 days of such decision, and the Commission shall require the carrier to enter into a sale or subsidy agreement with such offeror, if such sale or agreement incorporates the Commission's decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No purchaser of a line or portion of line sold under this section may transfer or discontinue service on such line prior to the end of the second year after consummation of the sale, nor may such purchaser transfer such line, except to the carrier from whom it was purchased, prior to the end of the fifth year after consummation of the sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any subsidy provided under this section may be discontinued on notice of 60 days. Unless, within such 60-day period, another financially responsible party enters into a subsidy agreement at least as beneficial to the carrier as that which was or was to be discontinued, the Commission shall, at the carrier's request, immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance of service on the line.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;financially responsible person&rdquo; means a person who (A) is capable of paying the constitutional minimum value of the railroad line proposed to be acquired, and (B) is able to assure that adequate transportation will be provided over such line for a period of not less than 3 years. Such term includes a governmental authority but does not include a class I or a class II rail carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;railroad line&rdquo; means (A) during the 3-year period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, a line of railroad which carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year, and (B) after the end of such 3-year period, any line of railroad.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) When the Interstate Commerce Commission finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a railroad line is on a system diagram map as required under section 10904 of this title, but the rail carrier owning such line has not filed an application to abandon such line under sections 10903 and 10904 of this title be<!-- PDFPage:292 -->fore an application to purchase such line, or any required preliminary filing with respect to such application, is filed under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an application to purchase such line has been filed, in accordance with regulations required under subsection (k) of this section, by a financially responsible person,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall require the rail carrier owning the railroad line to sell such line to such financially responsible person at a price not less than the constitutional minimum value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the constitutional minimum value of a particular railroad line shall be presumed to be not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line, whichever is greater, but shall not include the cost of providing a protective arrangement under subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For purposes of this section, the Commission may determine that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a railroad line if the Commission determines, after a hearing on the record, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the rail carrier operating such line refuses within a reasonable time to make the necessary efforts to provide adequate service to shippers who transport traffic over such line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the transportation over such line is inadequate for the majority of shippers who transport traffic over such line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the sale of such line will not have a significantly adverse financial effect on the rail carrier operating such line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the sale of such line will not have an adverse effect on the overall operational performance of the rail carrier operating such line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the sale of such line will be likely to result in improved railroad transportation for shippers that transport traffic over such line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding under this subsection, the burden of proving that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line is on the person filing the application to acquire such line. If the Commission finds under this subsection that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line, the Commission shall concurrently notify the parties of such finding and publish such finding in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In the case of any railroad line subject to sale under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall, upon the request of the acquiring carrier, require the selling carrier to provide to the acquiring carrier trackage rights to allow a reasonable interchange with the selling carrier or to move power equipment or empty rolling stock between noncontiguous feeder lines operated by the acquiring carrier. The Commission shall require the acquiring carrier to provide the selling carrier reasonable compensation for any such trackage rights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall require, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of the employees who would normally have performed work in connection with a railroad line subject to a sale under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In the case of a railroad line which carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year, whenever a purchasing carrier under this section petitions the Commission for joint rates applicable to traffic moving over through routes in which the purchasing carrier may practicably participate, the Commission shall, within 30 days after the date such petition is filed and pursuant to section 10705(a) of this title, require the establishment of reasonable joint rates and divisions over such route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Any person operating a railroad line acquired under this section may elect to be exempt from any of the provisions of this subtitle, except that such a person may not be exempt from the provisions of chapter 107 of this title with respect to transportation under a joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall apply to any line of railroad which was abandoned during the 18-month period immediately prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and was subsequently purchased by a financially responsible person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) If a purchasing carrier under this section proposes to sell or abandon all or any portion of a purchased railroad line, such purchasing carrier shall offer the right of first refusal with respect to such line or portion thereof to the carrier which sold such line under this section. Such offer shall be made at a price equal to the sum of the price paid by such purchasing carrier to such selling carrier for such line or portion thereof and the fair market value (less deterioration) of any improvements made, as adjusted to reflect inflation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Any person operating a railroad line acquired under this section may determine preconditions, such as payment of a subsidy, which must be met by shippers in order to obtain service over such lines, but such operator must notify the shippers on the line of its intention to impose such preconditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) In the case of any railroad line sold pursuant to this section, the Commission shall require the selling carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that established under section 11347 of this title.</p>
