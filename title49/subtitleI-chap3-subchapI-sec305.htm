<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;consistent with national transportation policies&rdquo; after &ldquo;develop standards and criteria&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of section 302 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;Based on experience&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in the light of experience&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;shall prescribe&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;be promulgated by the&rdquo;, to conform to other sections of the revised title. The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; after &ldquo;shall revise&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;This subsection does not apply to&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;except such proposals as are concerned with&rdquo; for clarity. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Federal agencies&rdquo; for clarity and consistency. Similar conforming changes are made throughout the section. The word &ldquo;services&rdquo; after &ldquo;provide transportation&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;48 contiguous States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;contiguous United States&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
