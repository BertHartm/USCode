<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Method of Calculation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall calculate the average fuel economy of a manufacturer subject to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) section 32902(a) of this title in a way prescribed by the Administrator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the number of passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer in a model year; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the sum of the fractions obtained by dividing the number of passenger automobiles of each model manufactured by the manufacturer in that model year by the fuel economy measured for that model.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In this paragraph, &ldquo;electric vehicle&rdquo; means a vehicle powered primarily by an electric motor drawing electrical current from a portable source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a manufacturer manufactures an electric vehicle, the Administrator shall include in the calculation of average fuel economy under paragraph (1) of this subsection equivalent petroleum based fuel economy values determined by the Secretary of Energy for various classes of electric vehicles. The Secretary shall review those values each year and determine and propose necessary revisions based on the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the approximate electrical energy efficiency of the vehicle, considering the kind of vehicle and the mission and weight of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the national average electrical generation and transmission efficiencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the need of the United States to conserve all forms of energy and the relative scarcity and value to the United States of all fuel used to generate electricity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the specific patterns of use of electric vehicles compared to petroleum-fueled vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Separate Calculations for Passenger Automobiles Manufactured Domestically and Not Domestically</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subsection, the Administrator shall make separate calculations under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) passenger automobiles manufactured domestically by a manufacturer (or included in this category under paragraph (5) of this subsection); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) passenger automobiles not manufactured domestically by that manufacturer (or excluded from this category under paragraph (5) of this subsection).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Passenger automobiles described in subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) of this paragraph are deemed to be manufactured by separate manufacturers under this chapter, except for the purposes of section 32903.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection (except as provided in paragraph (3)), a passenger automobile is deemed to be manufactured domestically in a model year if at least 75 percent of the cost to the manufacturer is attributable to value added in the United States or Canada, unless the as<!-- PDFPage:679 -->sembly of the automobile is completed in Canada and the automobile is imported into the United States more than 30 days after the end of the model year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In this subsection, a passenger automobile is deemed to be manufactured domestically in a model year, as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, if at least 75 percent of the cost to the manufacturer is attributable to value added in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, unless the assembly of the automobile is completed in Canada or Mexico and the automobile is imported into the United States more than 30 days after the end of the model year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph applies to automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer and sold in the United States, regardless of the place of assembly, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) A manufacturer that began assembling automobiles in Mexico before model year 1992 may elect, during the period from January 1, 1997, through January 1, 2004, to have subparagraph (A) of this paragraph apply to all automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer beginning with the model year that begins after the date of the election.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For a manufacturer that began assembling automobiles in Mexico after model year 1991, subparagraph (A) of this paragraph applies to all automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer beginning with the model year that begins after January 1, 1994, or the model year beginning after the date the manufacturer begins assembling automobiles in Mexico, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) A manufacturer not described in clause (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph that assembles automobiles in the United States or Canada, but not in Mexico, may elect, during the period from January 1, 1997, through January 1, 2004, to have subparagraph (A) of this paragraph apply to all automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer beginning with the model year that begins after the date of the election. However, if the manufacturer begins assembling automobiles in Mexico before making an election under this subparagraph, this clause does not apply, and the manufacturer is subject to clause (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) For a manufacturer that does not assemble automobiles in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, subparagraph (A) of this paragraph applies to all automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer beginning with the model year that begins after January 1, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) For a manufacturer described in clause (i) or (iii) of this subparagraph that does not make an election within the specified period, subparagraph (A) of this paragraph applies to all automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer beginning with the model year that begins after January 1, 2004.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe reasonable procedures for elections under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this subsection, the fuel economy of a passenger automobile that is not manufactured domestically is deemed to be equal to the average fuel economy of all passenger automobiles manufactured by the same manufacturer that are not manufactured domestically.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) A manufacturer may submit to the Secretary of Transportation for approval a plan, including supporting material, stating the actions and the deadlines for taking the actions, that will ensure that the model or models referred to in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph will be manufactured domestically before the end of the 4th model year covered by the plan. The Secretary promptly shall consider and act on the plan. The Secretary shall approve the plan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary finds that the plan is inadequate to meet the requirements of this paragraph; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the manufacturer previously has submitted a plan approved by the Secretary under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the plan is approved, the Administrator shall include under paragraph (1)(A)(i) and exclude under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) of this subsection, for each of the 4 model years covered by the plan, not more than 150,000 passenger automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer but not qualifying as domestically manufactured if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the model or models involved previously have not been manufactured domestically;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) at least 50 percent of the cost to the manufacturer of each of the automobiles is attributable to value added in the United States or Canada;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the automobiles, if their assembly was completed in Canada, are imported into the United States not later than 30 days after the end of the model year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the model or models are manufactured domestically before the end of the 4th model year covered by the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Testing and Calculation Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall measure fuel economy for each model and calculate average fuel economy for a manufacturer under testing and calculation procedures prescribed by the Administrator. However, except under section 32908 of this title, the Administrator shall use the same procedures for passenger automobiles the Administrator used for model year 1975 (weighted 55 percent urban cycle and 45 percent highway cycle), or procedures that give comparable results. A measurement of fuel economy or a calculation of average fuel economy (except under section 32908) shall be rounded off to the nearest .1 of a mile a gallon. The Administrator shall decide on the quantity of other fuel that is equivalent to one gallon of gasoline. To the extent practicable, fuel economy tests shall be carried out with emissions tests under section 206 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7525).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date of Procedure or Amendment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe a procedure under this section, or an amendment (except a technical or clerical amendment) in a procedure, at least 12 months before the beginning of the model year to which the procedure or amendment applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Reports and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall report measurements and calculations under this section to the Secretary of Transportation and shall consult and coordinate with the Secretary in carrying out this section.</p>
