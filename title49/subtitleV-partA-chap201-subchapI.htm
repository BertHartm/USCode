<p class="statutory-body">(2) The order shall describe the condition or practice, or a combination of conditions and practices, that causes the emergency situation and prescribe standards and procedures for obtaining relief from the order. This paragraph does not affect the Secretary's discretion under this section to maintain the order in effect for as long as the emergency situation exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After issuing an order under this section, the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for review of the order under section 554 of title 5. If a petition for review is filed and the review is not completed by the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the order was issued, the order stops being effective at the end of that period unless the Secretary decides in writing that the emergency situation still exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Compel Issuance of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An employee of a railroad carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce who may be exposed to imminent physical injury during that employment because of the Secretary's failure, without any reasonable basis, to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section, or the employee's authorized representative, may bring a civil action against the Secretary in a district court of the United States to compel the Secretary to issue an order. The action must be brought in the judicial district in which the emergency situation is alleged to exist, in which that employing carrier has its principal executive office, or for the District of Columbia. The Secretary's failure to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section may be reviewed only under section 706 of title 5.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Investigative and Surveillance Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may pre<!-- PDFPage:305 -->scribe investigative and surveillance activities necessary to enforce the safety regulations prescribed and orders issued by the Secretary that apply to railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in a State. The State may participate in those activities when the safety practices for railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in the State are regulated by a State authority and the authority submits to the Secretary an annual certification as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Annual Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State authority's annual certification must include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a certification that the authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has regulatory jurisdiction over the safety practices for railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) was given a copy of each safety regulation prescribed and order issued by the Secretary, that applies to the equipment, facilities, rolling stock, or operations, as of the date of certification; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is conducting the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a report, in the form the Secretary prescribes by regulation, that includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the name and address of each railroad carrier subject to the safety jurisdiction of the authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) each accident or incident reported during the prior 12 months by a railroad carrier involving a fatality, personal injury requiring hospitalization, or property damage of more than $750 (or a higher amount prescribed by the Secretary), and a summary of the authority's investigation of the cause and circumstances surrounding the accident or incident;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the record maintenance, reporting, and inspection practices conducted by the authority to aid the Secretary in enforcing railroad safety regulations prescribed and orders issued by the Secretary, including the number of inspections made of railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations by the authority during the prior 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) other information the Secretary requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annual certification applies to a safety regulation prescribed or order issued after the date of the certification only if the State authority submits an appropriate certification to provide the necessary investigative and surveillance activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, after receipt of an annual certification, the Secretary decides the State authority is not complying satisfactorily with the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may reject any part of the certification or take other appropriate action to achieve adequate enforcement. The Secretary must give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking action under this paragraph. When the Secretary gives notice, the burden of proof is on the authority to show that it is complying satisfactorily with the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Agreement When Certification Not Received</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary does not receive an annual certification under subsection (a) of this section related to any railroad equipment, facility, rolling stock, or operation, the Secretary may make an agreement with a State authority for the authority to provide any part of the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed by the Secretary as necessary to enforce the safety regulations and orders applicable to the equipment, facility, rolling stock, or operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may terminate any part of an agreement made under this subsection on finding that the authority has not provided every part of the investigative and surveillance activities to which the agreement relates. The Secretary must give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before making such a finding. The finding and termination shall be published in the Federal Register and may not become effective for at least 15 days after the date of publication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Agreement for Investigative and Surveillance Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to providing for State participation under this section, the Secretary may make an agreement with a State to provide investigative and surveillance activities related to the Secretary's duties under chapters 203&ndash;213 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Payment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On application by a State authority that has submitted a certification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section or made an agreement under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, the Secretary shall pay not more than 50 percent of the cost of the personnel, equipment, and activities of the authority needed, during the next fiscal year, to carry out a safety program under the certification or agreement. However, the Secretary may pay an authority only when the authority assures the Secretary that it will provide the remaining cost of the safety program and that the total State money expended for the safety program, excluding grants of the United States Government, will be at least as much as the average amount expended for the fiscal years that ended June 30, 1969, and June 30, 1970.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may monitor State investigative and surveillance practices and carry out other inspections and investigations necessary to help enforce this chapter.</p>

The words &ldquo;the Attorney General may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such district court shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (last sentence), &ldquo;The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(d)(2), and &ldquo;The United States district court shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon petition by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have jurisdiction&rdquo; in 45:439(a) for clarity and consistency. It is not necessary to restate that the district court has jurisdiction because of 28:1331 and 1345. See also the statement of Senator Prouty in 115 Cong. Rec. 40205 (1969) explaining that similar language in section 110 of S. 1933, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (the derivative source for 45:439) would grant the Attorney General the power to seek injunctions. Clauses (1)&ndash;(3) are substituted for the source provisions to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of rules 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are omitted as surplus because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.) apply in the district court unless otherwise provided. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;or an amount agreed on in compromise&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the text of 45:439(c) (words before 1st comma) is omitted because it applies only to actions brought by a State authority. See discussion of the cross-reference in the note for section 20113(c) of <!-- PDFPage:310 -->the revised title. The last sentence is substituted for &ldquo;in which the individual resides&rdquo; in 45:438(c) because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;compliance order issued under section 20111(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;order, or directive&rdquo; because the latter words are interpreted as referring to &ldquo;orders directing compliance&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (2d sentence), restated in section 20111(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Injunctive Relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Transportation does not begin a civil action under section 20112 of this title to enjoin the violation of a railroad safety regulation prescribed or order issued by the Secretary not later than 15 days after the date the Secretary receives notice of the violation and a request from a State authority participating in investigative and surveillance activities under section 20105 of this title that the action be brought, the authority may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to enjoin the violation. This subsection does not apply if the Secretary makes an affirmative written finding that the violation did not occur or that the action is not necessary because of other enforcement action taken by the Secretary related to the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Imposition and Collection of Civil Penalties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary does not impose the applicable civil penalty for a violation of a railroad safety regulation prescribed or order issued by the Secretary not later than 60 days after the date of receiving notice from a State authority participating in investigative and surveillance activities under section 20105 of this title, the authority may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to impose and collect the penalty. This paragraph does not apply if the Secretary makes an affirmative written finding that the violation did not occur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil action under this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the violation occurred or the defendant has its principal executive office. However, a State authority may not bring an action under this section outside the State.</p>

The Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1980 was derived from S. 2730, which in turn was derived from H.R. 7104. See 126 Cong. Rec. 26535 (1980). Section 207(d) in an earlier version of H.R. 7104 was redesignated as section 207(c) during the legislative process and no section 207(d) was enacted. See H.R. Rept.
