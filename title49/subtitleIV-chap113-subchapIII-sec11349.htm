<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Pending determination of an application filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission under this subchapter for approval of a consolidation or merger of the properties of at least 2 motor carriers or at least 2 water carriers, or of a purchase, lease, or contract to operate the properties of at least one motor carrier or at least one water carrier, the Commission may approve, for a period of not more than 180 days, the operation of the properties sought to be acquired by the person proposing in the application to acquire those properties. The Commission may approve operation of motor carrier properties when it appears that failure to grant the approval may result in destruction of or injury to those motor carrier properties the person is seeking to acquire, or substantially interfere with their future usefulness in providing adequate and continuous service to the public. The Commission may approve the operation of water carrier properties only for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may take action under subsection (a) of this section without regard to subchapter II of chapter 103 of this title and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. Transportation provided by a motor carrier under a grant of approval under this section is subject to this subtitle.</p>
