<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;that violates this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;who commits any act or causes to be done any act that violates any provision of this subchapter or omits to do any act or causes to be omitted any act that is required by any such provision&rdquo; in 15:1990b(a) for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;No transferor shall violate any rule prescribed under this section&rdquo; in 15:1988 for consistency in the revised title and because &ldquo;rule&rdquo; is synonymous with &ldquo;regulations&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;A separate violation occurs for each motor vehicle or device involved in the violation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;A violation of any such provision shall, for purposes of this section, constitute a separate violation with respect to each motor vehicle or device involved&rdquo; in 15:1990b(a) to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the words &ldquo;on behalf of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;Before compromising the amount of a penalty, the Secretary shall give&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;after affording&rdquo; for clarity.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction&rdquo; are omitted because of 28:1331. The words &ldquo;for cause shown and subject to the provisions of rule 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because the rules apply in the absence of an exemption from them.

The words &ldquo;United States district court&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;district court of the United States&rdquo; for consistency with the definition in section 32101 of the revised title and with other provisions of the chapter.</p>
