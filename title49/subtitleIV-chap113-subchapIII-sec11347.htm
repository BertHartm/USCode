<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">When a rail carrier is involved in a transaction for which approval is sought under sections 11344 and 11345 or section 11346 of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees who are affected by the transaction as the terms imposed under this section before February 5, 1976, and the terms established under sections 24307(c), 24312, and 24706(c) of this title. Notwithstanding this subtitle, the arrangement may be made by the rail carrier and the authorized representative of its employees. The arrangement and the order approving the transaction must require that the employees of the affected rail carrier will not be in a worse position related to their employment as a result of the transaction during the 4 years following the effective date of the final action of the Commission (or if an employee was employed for a lesser period of time by the carrier before the action became effective, for that lesser period).</p>

The words &ldquo;or paragraph (3)&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement.

Such arrangement shall contain provisions no less protective of the interests of employees than those heretofore imposed pursuant to this subdivision and those established pursuant to section 565 of title 45&rdquo; for clarity and to correct the amendment made by section 402(a) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 that added the word &ldquo;heretofore&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;related to&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;any other provisions of&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo; is omitted as obsolete.
