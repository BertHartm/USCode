<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Public convenience and necessity require that Amtrak, to the extent its budget allows, provide modern, cost-efficient, and energy-efficient intercity rail passenger transportation between crowded urban areas and in other areas of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Rail passenger transportation can help alleviate overcrowding of airways and airports and on highways.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A traveler in the United States should have the greatest possible choice of transportation most convenient to the needs of the traveler.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A greater degree of cooperation is necessary among Amtrak, other rail carriers, State, regional, and local governments, the private sector, labor organizations, and suppliers of services and equipment to Amtrak to achieve a performance level sufficient to justify expending public money.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Modern and efficient commuter rail passenger transportation is important to the viabil<!-- PDFPage:315 -->ity and well-being of major urban areas and to the energy conservation and self-sufficiency goals of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) As a rail passenger transportation entity, Amtrak should be available to operate commuter rail passenger transportation through its subsidiary, Amtrak Commuter, under contract with commuter authorities that do not provide the transportation themselves as part of the governmental function of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Northeast Corridor is a valuable resource of the United States used by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation and freight transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Greater coordination between intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;By using innovative operating and marketing concepts, Amtrak shall provide intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation that completely develops the potential of modern rail transportation to meet the intercity and commuter passenger transportation needs of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Goals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use its best business judgment in acting to minimize United States Government subsidies, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increasing employee productivity;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) minimize Government subsidies by encouraging State, regional, and local governments and the private sector to share the cost of providing rail passenger transportation, including the cost of operating facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) carry out strategies to achieve immediately maximum productivity and efficiency consistent with safe and efficient transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) operate Amtrak trains, to the maximum extent feasible, to all station stops within 15 minutes of the time established in public timetables;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) develop transportation on rail corridors subsidized by States and private parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) implement schedules based on a systemwide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be achieved with a degree of reliability and passenger comfort;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) encourage rail carriers to assist in improving intercity rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) improve generally the performance of Amtrak through comprehensive and systematic operational programs and employee incentives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) carry out policies that ensure equitable access to the Northeast Corridor by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) coordinate the uses of the Northeast Corridor, particularly intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall decide the dispute not later than 90 days after Amtrak submits the dispute to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak's right to use the facilities or have the services provided is conditioned on payment of the compensation. If the compensation is not paid promptly, the rail carrier or authority entitled to it may bring an action against Amtrak to recover the amount owed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Amtrak shall seek immediate and appropriate legal remedies to enforce its contract rights when track maintenance on a route over which Amtrak operates falls below the contractual standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Operating During Emergencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To facilitate operation by Amtrak during an emergency, the Commission, on application by Amtrak, shall require a rail carrier to provide facilities immediately during the emergency. The Commission then shall promptly prescribe reasonable terms, including indemnification of the carrier by Amtrak against personal injury risk to which the carrier may be exposed. The rail carrier shall provide the facilities for the duration of the emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preference Over Freight Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except in an emergency, intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation provided by or for Amtrak has preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, junction, or crossing unless the Secretary of Transportation orders otherwise under this subsection. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may apply to the Secretary for relief. If the Secretary, after an opportunity for a hearing under section 553 of title 5, decides that preference for intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation materially will lessen the quality of freight transportation provided to shippers, the Secretary shall establish the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on reasonable terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Accelerated Speeds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a rail carrier refuses to allow accelerated speeds on trains operated by or for Amtrak, Amtrak may apply to the Secretary for an order requiring the carrier to allow the accelerated speeds. The Secretary shall decide whether accelerated speeds are unsafe or impracticable and which improvements would be required to make accelerated speeds safe and practicable. After an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary shall establish the maximum allowable speeds of Amtrak trains on terms the Secretary decides are reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Additional Trains</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When a rail carrier does not agree to provide, or allow Amtrak to provide, for the operation of additional trains over a rail line of the carrier, Amtrak may apply to the Secretary for an order requiring the carrier to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains. After a hearing on the record, the Secretary may order the carrier, within 60 days, to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains on a schedule based on legally permissible operating times. However, if the Secretary decides not to hold a hearing, the Secretary, not later than 30 days after receiving the application, shall publish in the Federal Register the reasons for the decision not to hold the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when conducting a hearing, whether an order would impair unreasonably freight transportation of the rail carrier, with the carrier having the burden of demonstrating that the additional trains will impair the freight transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when establishing scheduled running times, the statutory goal of Amtrak to imple<!-- PDFPage:328 -->ment schedules that attain a system-wide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be adhered to with a high degree of reliability and passenger comfort.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Unless the parties have an agreement that establishes the compensation Amtrak will pay the carrier for additional trains provided under an order under this subsection, the Commission shall decide the dispute under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24309. Retaining and maintaining facilities</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;facility&rdquo; means a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, facility, or real property related to a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, or facility, including a signal system, passenger station and repair tracks, a station building, a platform, and a related facility, including a water, fuel, steam, electric, and air line.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:329 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) downgrading a facility means reducing a track classification as specified in the Federal Railroad Administration track safety standards or altering a facility so that the time required for rail passenger transportation to be provided over the route on which a facility is located may be increased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval Required for Downgrading or Disposal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A facility of a rail carrier or regional transportation authority that Amtrak used to provide rail passenger transportation on February 1, 1979, may be downgraded or disposed of only after approval by the Secretary of Transportation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification and Analysis</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A rail carrier intending to downgrade or dispose of a facility Amtrak currently is not using to provide transportation shall notify Amtrak of its intention. If, not later than 60 days after Amtrak receives the notice, Amtrak and the carrier do not agree to retain or maintain the facility or to convey an interest in the facility to Amtrak, the carrier may apply to the Secretary for approval to downgrade or dispose of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a rail carrier notifies Amtrak of its intention to downgrade or dispose of a facility, Amtrak shall survey population centers with rail passenger transportation facilities to assist in preparing a valid and timely analysis of the need for the facility and shall update the survey as appropriate. Amtrak also shall maintain a system for collecting information gathered in the survey. The system shall collect the information based on geographic regions and on whether the facility would be part of a short haul or long haul route. The survey should facilitate an analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ridership potential by ascertaining existing and changing travel patterns that would provide maximum efficient rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quality of transportation of competitors or likely competitors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the likelihood of Amtrak offering transportation at a competitive fare;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) opportunities to target advertising and fares to potential classes of riders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) economic characteristics of rail passenger transportation related to the facility and the extent to which the characteristics are consistent with sound economic principles of short haul or long haul rail transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the feasibility of applying effective internal cost controls to the facility and route served by the facility to improve the ratio of passenger revenue to transportation expenses (excluding maintenance of tracks, structures, and equipment and depreciation).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Approval of Application and Payment of Avoidable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If Amtrak does not object to an application not later than 30 days after it is submitted, the Secretary shall approve the application promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If Amtrak objects to an application, the Secretary shall decide by not later than 180 days after the objection those costs the rail carrier may avoid if it does not have to retain or maintain a facility in the condition Amtrak requests. If Amtrak does not agree by not later than 60 days after the decision to pay the carrier these avoidable costs, the Secretary shall approve the application. When deciding whether to pay a carrier the avoidable costs of retaining or maintaining a facility, Amtrak shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the potential importance of restoring rail passenger transportation on the route on which the facility is located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the market potential of the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the availability, adequacy, and energy efficiency of an alternate rail line or alternate mode of transportation to provide passenger transportation to or near the places that would be served by the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the extent to which major population centers would be served by the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the extent to which providing transportation over the route would encourage the expansion of an intercity rail passenger system in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the possibility of increased ridership on a rail line that connects with the route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Other Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Downgrading or disposing of a facility under this section does not relieve a rail carrier from complying with its other common carrier or legal obligations related to the facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent financial resources are available, Amtrak may acquire by eminent domain under subsection (b) of this section interests in property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, except property of a rail carrier, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a governmental authority; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requested by the Secretary of Transportation in carrying out the Secretary's duty to design and build an intermodal transportation terminal at Union Station in the District of Columbia if the Secretary assures Amtrak that the Secretary will reimburse Amtrak.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak may exercise the power of eminent domain only if it cannot&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquire the interest in the property by contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) agree with the owner on the purchase price for the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A civil action to acquire an interest in property by eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section must be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the property is located or, if a single piece of property is located in more than one judicial district, in any judicial district in which any piece of the property is located. An interest is condemned and taken by Amtrak for its use when a declaration of taking is filed under this subsection and an amount of money estimated in the declaration to be just compensation for the interest is deposited in the court. The declaration may be filed with the complaint in the action or at any time before judgment. The declaration must contain or be accompanied by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of the public use for which the interest is taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of the property sufficient to identify it;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a statement of the interest in the property taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a plan showing the interest taken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a statement of the amount of money Amtrak estimates is just compensation for the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the declaration is filed and the deposit is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, title to the property vests in Amtrak in fee simple absolute or in the lesser interest shown in the declaration, and the right to the money vests in the person entitled to the money. When the declaration is filed, the court may decide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the time by which, and the terms under which, possession of the property is given to Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the disposition of outstanding charges related to the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After a hearing, the court shall make a finding on the amount that is just compensation for the interest in the property and enter judgment awarding that amount and interest on it. The rate of interest is 6 percent a year and is computed on the amount of the award less the amount deposited in the court from the date of taking to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) On application of a party, the court may order immediate payment of any part of the amount deposited in the court for the compensation to be awarded. If the award is more than the amount received, the court shall enter judgment against Amtrak for the deficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Condemn Rail Carrier Property Interests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If Amtrak and a rail carrier cannot agree on a sale to Amtrak of an interest in property of a rail carrier necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, Amtrak may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order establishing the need of Amtrak for the interest and requiring the carrier to convey the interest on reasonable terms, including just compensation. The need of Amtrak is deemed to be established, and the Commission, after holding an expedited proceeding and not later than 120 days after receiving the application, shall order the interest conveyed unless the Commission decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conveyance would impair significantly the ability of the carrier to carry out its obligations as a common carrier; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:331 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the obligations of Amtrak to provide modern, efficient, and economical rail passenger transportation can be met adequately by acquiring an interest in other property, either by sale or by exercising its right of eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the amount of compensation is not determined by the date of the Commission's order, the order shall require, as part of the compensation, interest at 6 percent a year from the date prescribed for the conveyance until the compensation is paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak subsequently may reconvey to a third party an interest conveyed to Amtrak under this subsection or prior comparable provision of law if the Commission decides that the reconveyance will carry out the purposes of this part, regardless of when the proceeding was brought (including a proceeding pending before a United States court on November 28, 1990).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Routes Recommended for Discontinuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To maintain a national intercity rail passenger system in the United States and if a reduction in operating expenses can be achieved, Amtrak shall provide rail passenger transportation over each route the Secretary of Transportation recommended be discontinued under section 4 of the Amtrak Improvement Act of 1978 and may restructure a route to serve a major population center as an ending place or principal intermediate place. Transportation over a long distance route shall be maintained if the Amtrak estimate for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, was that the short term avoidable loss for each passenger mile on the route was not more than 7 cents. Transportation over a short distance route shall be maintained if the Amtrak estimate for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, was that the short term avoidable loss for each passenger mile on the route was not more than 9 cents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For all routes, Amtrak shall calculate short term avoidable loss for each passenger-mile based on consistently defined factors. Calculations shall be based on the most recent available statistics for a 90-day period, except that Amtrak may use historical information adjusted to reflect the most recent available statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Deferral of Secretary's Recommendations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To provide equivalent or improved transportation consistent with the goals of section 4(a) of the Act, Amtrak may defer carrying out a recommendation of the Secretary under section 4 of the Act that requires providing transportation over a rail line not used in intercity rail passenger transportation on May 24, 1979, requires using a new facility, or requires making a new labor agreement, until any necessary capital improvements are made in the line or facility or the agreement is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding another law and the route and service criteria, during the period a decision of the Secretary under section 4 of the Act is deferred, Amtrak shall provide substitute transportation over existing routes recommended for restructuring and over other existing feasible routes. Except for transportation concentrating on commuter ridership over a short haul route, transportation provided under this paragraph may be provided only if the route complies with subsection (a) of this section, adjusted to reflect constant 1979 dollars.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Short Haul Demonstration Routes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding this part, Amtrak may provide short haul trains on additional routes totaling not more than 200 miles that link at least 2 major metropolitan areas&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on a demonstration basis to establish the feasibility and benefits of the transportation; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak shall notify each affected State or regional or local transportation authority of a discontinuance under this subsection as soon as possible after Amtrak decides to discontinue the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Employee Protective Arrangements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak or a rail carrier (including a terminal company) shall provide fair and equitable arrangements to protect the interests of employees of Amtrak or a rail carrier, as the case may be, affected by a discontinuance of intercity rail passenger service, including a discontinuance of service provided by a rail carrier under a facility or service agreement under section 24308(a) of this title under a modification or ending of the agreement or because Amtrak begins providing that service. Arrangements shall include provisions that may be necessary for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Route Reviews</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall review annually each route in the basic system to decide if the route meets the long distance or short distance route criterion, as appropriate, under section 24705(a)(1) of this title, adjusted to reflect constant 1979 dollars. The review shall include an evaluation of the potential market demand for, and the cost of providing transportation on, a part of the route and an alternative route. Amtrak shall submit the results of the review to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Secretary of Transportation. If Amtrak decides that a route will not meet the criterion under section 24705(a)(1), as adjusted, Amtrak shall modify or discontinue rail passenger transportation operations on the route so that it will meet the criterion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Financial Requirements and Performance Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after the beginning of each fiscal year, Amtrak shall evaluate the financial requirements for operating the basic system and the progress in achieving the system-wide performance standards prescribed under this part during the fiscal year. If Amtrak decides amounts available for the fiscal year are not enough to meet estimated operating costs, or if Amtrak estimates it cannot meet the performance standards, Amtrak shall act to reduce costs and improve performance. Action under this subsection shall be designed to continue the maximum level of transportation practicable, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) changing the frequency of transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) increasing fares;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reducing the cost of sleeper car and dining car service on certain routes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increasing the passenger capacity of cars used on certain routes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) modifying the route system or discontinuing transportation over routes, considering short term avoidable loss and the number of passengers served on those routes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Cost Limitations and Revenue Goals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Annual costs of Amtrak may not be more than amounts, including grants made under section 24104 of this title, contributions of States, regional and local authorities, and other persons, and revenues, available to Amtrak in the fiscal year. Amtrak annually shall set a goal of recovering an amount so that its revenues, including contributions, is at least 61 percent of its costs, except capital costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Conductor Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To assess the operational performance of trains, the President of Amtrak may direct the conductor on any train of Amtrak to report to Amtrak any inadequacy of train operation.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Northeast Corridor Improvement Plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent of amounts appropriated under section 24909 of this title, Amtrak shall carry out a Northeast Corridor improvement program to achieve the following goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish not later than September 30, 1985, regularly scheduled and dependable intercity rail passenger transportation between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Boston, Massachusetts, and New York, New York, in not more than 3 hours and 40 minutes, including intermediate stops; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) New York, New York, and the District of Columbia, in not more than 2 hours and 40 minutes, including intermediate stops;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve facilities, under route criteria approved by Congress, on routes to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Albany, New York, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, from the Northeast Corridor main line, and to Boston, Massachusetts, and New Haven, Connecticut, from Springfield, Massachusetts, to make those facilities more compatible with improved high-speed transportation provided on the Northeast Corridor main line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) improve nonoperational parts of stations, related facilities, and fencing used in intercity rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) facilitate improvements in, and usage of, commuter rail passenger, rail rapid transit, and local public transportation, to the extent compatible with clauses (1)&ndash;(3) of this subsection and subsections (f) and (h) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) maintain and improve rail freight transportation in or adjacent to the Northeast Corridor and through-freight transportation in the Northeast Corridor, to the extent compatible with clauses (1)&ndash;(4) of this subsection and subsections (f) and (h) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) continue and improve passenger radio mobile telephone service on high-speed rail passenger transportation between Boston, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia, to the extent compatible with clauses (1)&ndash;(3) of this subsection and subsections (f) and (h) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) eliminate to the maximum extent practicable congestion in rail freight and rail passenger transportation at the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland, by rehabilitating and improving the tunnel and the rail lines approaching the tunnel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Managing Costs and Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall manage its operating costs, pricing policies, and other factors with the goal of having revenues derived each fiscal year from providing intercity rail passenger transportation over the Northeast Corridor route between the District of Columbia and Boston, Massachusetts, equal at least the operating costs of providing that transportation in that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Cost Sharing for Nonoperational Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Fifty percent of the cost of improvements under subsection (a)(3) of this section shall be paid by a State, local or regional transportation authority or other responsible party. However, Amtrak may finance entirely a safety-related improvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a part of the cost of improvements under subsection (a)(3) of this section will be paid by a responsible party under paragraph (1) of this subsection, Amtrak may make an agreement with the party under which Amtrak&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall carry out the improvements with amounts appropriated under section 24909 of this title and the party shall reimburse Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to the extent provided in an appropriation law, may incur obligations for contracts to carry out the improvements in anticipation of reimbursement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:346 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Amounts reimbursed to Amtrak under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be credited to the appropriation originally charged for the cost of the improvements and are available for further obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Passenger Radio Mobile Telephone Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President and departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government shall assist Amtrak under subsection (a)(6) of this section, subject to the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) and radio services standards, when the Federal Communications Commission decides the assistance is in the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Priorities in Selecting and Scheduling Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When selecting and scheduling specific projects, Amtrak shall apply the following considerations, in the following order of priority:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Safety-related items should be completed before other items because the safety of the passengers and users of the Northeast Corridor is paramount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Activities that benefit the greatest number of passengers should be completed before activities involving fewer passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Reliability of intercity rail passenger transportation must be emphasized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Trip-time requirements of this section must be achieved to the extent compatible with the priorities referred to in paragraphs (1)&ndash;(3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Improvements that will pay for the investment by achieving lower operating or maintenance costs should be carried out before other improvements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Construction operations should be scheduled so that the fewest possible passengers are inconvenienced, transportation is maintained, and the on-time performance of Northeast Corridor commuter rail passenger and rail freight transportation is optimized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Planning should focus on completing activities that will provide immediate benefits to users of the Northeast Corridor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Compatibility With Future Improvements and Production of Maximum Labor Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Improvements under this section shall be compatible with future improvements in transportation and shall produce the maximum labor benefit from hiring individuals presently unemployed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Automatic Train Control Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A train operating on the Northeast Corridor main line or between the main line and Atlantic City shall be equipped with an automatic train control system designed to slow or stop the train in response to an external signal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>High-Speed Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If practicable, Amtrak shall establish intercity rail passenger transportation in the Northeast Corridor that carries out section 703(1)(E) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;210, 90 Stat. 121).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Equipment Development</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall develop economical and reliable equipment compatible with track, operating, and marketing characteristics of the Northeast Corridor, including the capability to meet reliable trip times under section 703(1)(E) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;210, 90 Stat. 121) in regularly scheduled revenue transportation in the Corridor, when the Northeast Corridor improvement program is completed. Amtrak must decide that equipment complies with this subsection before buying equipment with financial assistance of the Government. Amtrak shall submit a request for an authorization of appropriations for production of the equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Agreements for Off-Corridor Routing of Rail Freight Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak may make an agreement with a rail freight carrier or a regional transportation authority under which the carrier will carry out an alternate off-corridor routing of rail freight transportation over rail lines in the Northeast Corridor between the District of Columbia and New York metropolitan areas, including intermediate points. The agreement shall be for at least 5 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak shall apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of the agreement and all related agreements accompanying the application as soon as the agreement is made. If the Commission finds that approval is necessary to carry out this chapter, the Commission shall approve the application and related agreements not later than 90 days after receiving the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an agreement is not made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, Amtrak, with the consent of the other parties, may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Not later than 90 days after the application, the Commission shall decide on the terms of an agreement if it decides that doing so is necessary to carry out this chapter. The decision of the Commission is binding on the other parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Coordination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall coordinate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) transportation programs related to the Northeast Corridor to ensure that the programs are integrated and consistent with the Northeast Corridor improvement program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) amounts from departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government to achieve urban redevelopment and revitalization in the vicinity of urban rail stations in the Northeast Corridor served by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary finds significant noncompliance with this section, the Secretary may deny financing to a noncomplying program until the noncompliance is corrected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) <cap-smallcap>Completion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall give the highest priority to completing the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Applicable Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No State or local building, zoning, subdivision, or similar or related law, nor any other State or local law from which a project would be exempt if undertaken by the Federal Government or an agency thereof within a Federal enclave wherein Federal jurisdiction is exclusive, including without limitation with respect to all such laws referenced herein above requirements for permits, actions, approvals or filings, shall apply in connection with the construction, ownership, use, operation, financing, leasing, conveying, mortgaging or enforcing a mortgage of (i) any improvement undertaken by or for the benefit of <!-- PDFPage:347 -->Amtrak as part of, or in furtherance of, the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project (including without limitation maintenance, service, inspection or similar facilities acquired, constructed or used for high speed trainsets) or chapter 241, 243, or 247 of this title or (ii) any land (and right, title or interest created with respect thereto) on which such improvement is located and adjoining, surrounding or any related land. These exemptions shall remain in effect and be applicable with respect to such land and improvements for the benefit of any mortgagee before, upon and after coming into possession of such improvements or land, any third party purchasers thereof in foreclosure (or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure), and their respective successors and assigns, in each case to the extent the land or improvements are used, or held for use, for railroad purposes or purposes accessory thereto. This subsection (m) shall not apply to any improvement or related land unless Amtrak receives a Federal operating subsidy in the fiscal year in which Amtrak commits to or initiates such improvement.</p>
