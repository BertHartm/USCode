<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Subject to this chapter and other provisions of law&rdquo; are inserted to inform the reader that other sections of the chapter and subtitle qualify the grant of jurisdiction to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the section. The words &ldquo;the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction over&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The provisions of this chapter apply to&rdquo; and &ldquo;the regulation of such transportation, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate redundancy. The words &ldquo;and providing facilities for&rdquo; are omitted as being included in the definition of &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; applicable to the subtitle. The words &ldquo;to the extent that passengers, property, or both, are transported by motor carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;whether such commerce moves wholly by motor vehicle or partly by motor vehicle and partly by rail, express, or water&rdquo; to eliminate surplus words and because of the Commission's jurisdiction over transportation by motor carrier, and the term &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; is a defined term incorporated into the definition of &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;This subtitle does not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. authorize the Commission&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;That nothing in this chapter shall empower the Commission&rdquo; in 49:316(e) for consistency and because of the restatement of the source provisions. The word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;intrastate transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;intrastate commerce&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;for any service connected therewith&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because the eliminated words are included in the word &ldquo;transportation&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rate, fare, or charge&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;rate&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;for the purpose of removing discrimination against interstate commerce or for any other purpose&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the source provisions. The words &ldquo;to provide intrastate transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to do intrastate business&rdquo; for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;over a motor carrier&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
