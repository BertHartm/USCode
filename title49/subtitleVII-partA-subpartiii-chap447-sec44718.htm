<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;By regulation or by order when necessary, the Secretary of Transportation shall require a person to give adequate public notice, in the form and way the Secretary prescribes, of the construction, alteration, establishment, or expansion, or the proposed construction, alteration, establishment, or expansion, of a structure or sanitary landfill when the notice will promote&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) safety in air commerce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the efficient use and preservation of the navigable airspace and of airport traffic capacity at public-use airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Studies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the Secretary decides that constructing or altering a structure may result in an obstruction of the navigable airspace or an interference with air navigation facilities and equipment or the navigable airspace, the Secretary shall conduct an aeronautical study to decide the extent of any adverse impact on the safe and efficient use of the airspace, facilities, or equipment. In conducting the study, the Secretary shall consider factors relevant to the efficient and effective use of the navigable airspace, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the impact on arrival, departure, and en route procedures for aircraft operating under visual flight rules;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:834 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the impact on arrival, departure, and en route procedures for aircraft operating under instrument flight rules;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the impact on existing public-use airports and aeronautical facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the impact on planned public-use airports and aeronautical facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the cumulative impact resulting from the proposed construction or alteration of a structure when combined with the impact of other existing or proposed structures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On completing the study, the Secretary shall issue a report disclosing completely the extent of the adverse impact on the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace that the Secretary finds will result from constructing or altering the structure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Broadcast Applications and Tower Studies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out laws related to a broadcast application and conducting an aeronautical study related to broadcast towers, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Communications Commission shall take action necessary to coordinate efficiently&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the receipt and consideration of, and action on, the application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the completion of any associated aeronautical study.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Construction of Landfills.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No person shall construct or establish a municipal solid waste landfill (as defined in section 258.2 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of the enactment of this subsection) that receives putrescible waste (as defined in section 257.3&ndash;8 of such title) within 6 miles of a public airport that has received grants under chapter 471 and is primarily served by general aviation aircraft and regularly scheduled flights of aircraft designed for 60 passengers or less unless the State aviation agency of the State in which the airport is located requests that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration exempt the landfill from the application of this subsection and the Administrator determines that such exemption would have no adverse impact on aviation safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the State of Alaska and shall not apply to the construction, establishment, expansion, or modification of, or to any other activity undertaken with respect to, a municipal solid waste landfill if the construction or establishment of the landfill was commenced on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">2000&mdash;Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 106&ndash;181 amended heading and text of subsec. (d) generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: &ldquo;For the purposes of enhancing aviation safety, in a case in which 2 landfills have been proposed to be constructed or established within 6 miles of a commercial service airport with fewer than 50,000 enplanements per year, no person shall construct or establish either landfill if an official of the Federal Aviation Administration has stated in writing within the 3-year period ending on the date of the enactment of this subsection that 1 of the landfills would be incompatible with aircraft operations at the airport, unless the landfill is already active on such date of enactment or the airport operator agrees to the construction or establishment of the landfill.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">1996&mdash;Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 104&ndash;264 added subsec. (d).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Effective Date of 2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Amendment by Pub. L. 106&ndash;181 applicable only to fiscal years beginning after Sept. 30, 1999, see section 3 of Pub. L. 106&ndash;181, set out as a note under section 106 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Except as otherwise specifically provided, amendment by Pub. L. 104&ndash;264 applicable only to fiscal years beginning after Sept. 30, 1996, and not to be construed as affecting funds made available for a fiscal year ending before Oct. 1, 1996, see section 3 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;264, set out as a note under section 106 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Landfills Interfering With Air Commerce</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;181, title V, &sect;503(a), Apr. 5, 2000, 114 Stat. 133, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) collisions between aircraft and birds have resulted in fatal accidents;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) bird strikes pose a special danger to smaller aircraft;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) landfills near airports pose a potential hazard to aircraft operating there because they attract birds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) even if the landfill is not located in the approach path of the airport's runway, it still poses a hazard because of the birds&rsquo; ability to fly away from the landfill and into the path of oncoming planes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) while certain mileage limits have the potential to be arbitrary, keeping landfills at least 6 miles away from an airport, especially an airport served by small planes, is an appropriate minimum requirement for aviation safety; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) closure of existing landfills (due to concerns about aviation safety) should be avoided because of the likely disruption to those who use and depend on such landfills.&rdquo;</p>
