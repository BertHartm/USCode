<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;By regulation or by order when necessary, the Secretary of Transportation shall require a person to give adequate public notice, in the form and way the Secretary prescribes, of the construction, alteration, establishment, or expansion, or the proposed construction, alteration, establishment, or expansion, of a structure or sanitary landfill when the notice will promote&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) safety in air commerce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the efficient use and preservation of the navigable airspace and of airport traffic capacity at public-use airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Studies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the Secretary decides that constructing or altering a structure may result in an obstruction of the navigable airspace or an interference with air navigation facilities and equipment or the navigable airspace, the Secretary shall conduct an aeronautical study to decide the extent of any adverse impact on the safe and efficient use of the airspace, facilities, or equipment. In conducting the study, the Secretary shall consider factors relevant to the efficient and effective use of the navigable airspace, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the impact on arrival, departure, and en route procedures for aircraft operating under visual flight rules;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the impact on arrival, departure, and en route procedures for aircraft operating under instrument flight rules;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the impact on existing public-use airports and aeronautical facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the impact on planned public-use airports and aeronautical facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the cumulative impact resulting from the proposed construction or alteration of a structure when combined with the impact of other existing or proposed structures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On completing the study, the Secretary shall issue a report disclosing completely the extent of the adverse impact on the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace that the Secretary finds will result from constructing or altering the structure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the completion of any associated aeronautical study.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Construction of Landfills.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) even if the landfill is not located in the approach path of the airport's runway, it still poses a hazard because of the birds&rsquo; ability to fly away from the landfill and into the path of oncoming planes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) while certain mileage limits have the potential to be arbitrary, keeping landfills at least 6 miles away from an airport, especially an airport served by small planes, is an appropriate minimum requirement for aviation safety; and</p>
