<p class="statutory-body">(a) When conducting a proceeding involving a matter referred under section 10341 of this title, a joint board may make an initial decision under section 10322 of this title. Subchapter II of this chapter applies to an initial decision of a joint board. However, a joint board may report to the Interstate Commerce Commission its conclusions on evidence received without making an initial decision. When a joint board makes a report instead of an initial decision, the Commission shall decide the matter. The Commission may consider the conclusions of the joint board in making its decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A joint board may make an initial decision or report of its conclusions only by a majority vote. However, if only one member of the board participates in the proceeding, that member shall make the initial decision alone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a member of a joint board does not participate in a proceeding referred to that board, after notice of the proceeding, the State from which that member was appointed waives its right to act in that proceeding. The waiver does not affect the duty or power of remaining members of the board to continue the proceeding and make an initial decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In addition to decisions made under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall decide a matter referred to a joint board when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the authority of each State from which a member of the board may be appointed waives action on a matter referred to that board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a joint board does not act, or cannot agree, on a matter referred to it in 45 days after the matter is referred to it (or in another period authorized by the Commission); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a member is nominated for only one State, except as provided in section 10342(c) of this title.</p>
