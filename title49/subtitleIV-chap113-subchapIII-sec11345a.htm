<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If a motor carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title is involved in a proposed transaction under section 11343 of this title, this section and section 11344 of this title also apply to the transaction. The Commission shall publish notice of the application in the Federal Register by the end of the 30th day after the application is filed with the Commission. However, if the application is incomplete, the Commission shall reject it by the end of that period. The order of rejection is a final decision of the Commission under section 10322 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Written comments about an application may be filed with the Commission within 45 days after notice of the application is published under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission must conclude evidentiary proceedings by the 240th day after the date of publication of notice under subsection (a) of this section. The Commission must issue a final decision by the 180th day after the date it concludes the evidentiary proceedings. In extraordinary circumstances, the Commission may extend a time period established by this section, except that the total of all such extensions with respect to any application shall not exceed 90 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may waive the requirement that an initial decision be made under section 10322 of this title and make a final decision itself when it determines that action is required for the timely execution of its functions under this subchapter or that an application governed by this section is of major transportation importance. The decision of the Commission under this subsection is a final decision under section 10322 of this title.</p>
