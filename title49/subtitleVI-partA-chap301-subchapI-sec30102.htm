<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the definitions apply to the entire chapter because of references in 15:1421&ndash;1431 applying 15:1391&ndash;1420 to 15:1421&ndash;1431. Before clause (1), the words &ldquo;As used&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the text of 15:1391(10) and 49 App.:1655(a)(6)(A) is omitted as surplus because the complete name of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section. The words &ldquo;selling and distributing&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;who is engaged in the sale and distribution of&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The word &ldquo;purposes&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. In clause (3), the words &ldquo;selling and distributing&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engaged in the sale and distribution of&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (5)(A), the words &ldquo;manufacturing or assembling&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (7), the words &ldquo;physician or other duly&rdquo; and &ldquo;drivers, passengers, and other&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (8), the words &ldquo;is also protected&rdquo; and &ldquo;to persons&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (9), the words &ldquo;which is practicable, which meets the need for motor vehicle safety and which provides objective criteria&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of 15:1392(a) which is restated in section 30111 of the revised title. In clauses (10) and (11), the words &ldquo;the Northern Mariana Islands&rdquo; are added because of section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, as enacted by the Act of March 24, 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;241, 90 Stat. 268), and as proclaimed to be in effect by the President on January 9, 1978 (Proc. No. 4534, Oct. 24, 1977, 42 F.R. 56593). The words &ldquo;the Canal Zone&rdquo; are omitted because of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977. In clause (10), the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;includes&rdquo; as being more appropriate. The words &ldquo;a State of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;each of the several States&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;the Commonwealth of&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (11), the word &ldquo;Federal&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because the district court of Puerto Rico is a district court of the United States under 28:119.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;The term&rdquo; and &ldquo;the term&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (B), the words &ldquo;of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment&rdquo; are added for clarity. In clause (E), the words &ldquo;to be&rdquo; are added for consistency. The words &ldquo;marketed under such brand name&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (F), the words &ldquo;a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency. The word &ldquo;noncompliance&rdquo; is <!-- PDFPage:531 -->substituted for &ldquo;failure to comply&rdquo; for consistency in the chapter. In clause (G), the words &ldquo;(rather than the manufacturer of such equipment)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;deemed to be&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;considered&rdquo; for consistency. In clause (H), the words &ldquo;which have been&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b)(2) is substituted for &ldquo;Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary&rdquo; for clarity and because of the restatement.</p>
