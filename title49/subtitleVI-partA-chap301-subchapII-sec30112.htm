<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in this section .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and subchapter III of this chapter&rdquo; are <!-- PDFPage:475 -->substituted for 15:1397(c)(1) to eliminate unnecessary words and because of the restatement. The reference to section 30113 is added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the text of 15:1397(a)(2)(D) is omitted as obsolete because under section 30124 of the revised title a standard prescribed under this chapter may not allow compliance by use of a safety belt interlock or a continuous buzzer. In clause (2)(A), the words &ldquo;despite exercising reasonable care&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in the exercise of due care&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Federal motor vehicle safety standards&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in this chapter. In clause (2)(B), the words &ldquo;without knowing about the noncompliance&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;unless such person knows that such vehicle or equipment does not so conform&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title. Clauses (4)&ndash;(8) are added to provide cross&ndash;references to sections restating exceptions to the general rule restated in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
