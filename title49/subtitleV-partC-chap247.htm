<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with that State or local government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to evaluate alternatives to the speed restriction, considering the local safety hazard that is the basis for the restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to consider modifying or eliminating the restriction to allow safe operation at higher speeds.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>High-Speed Rail Transportation Development</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On reasonable request by a State, political subdivision of a State, regional partnership, private sector representative, or other qualified person, Amtrak shall consult and cooperate to the extent feasible with that person to assist the efforts of that person to achieve high-speed rail transportation through equipment upgrades, grade-crossing safety improvements, and incremental infrastructure improvements on existing rail facilities that Amtrak uses (except the Northeast Corridor facilities). Not later than September 30, 1993, Amtrak shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report on its efforts under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) assure Amtrak that the State, authority, or person has sufficient resources to meet its share of the cost of the transportation for the time the transportation will be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contain a market analysis acceptable to Amtrak to ensure that there is adequate demand for the transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) commit the State, authority, or person to provide at least 45 percent of the short term avoidable loss of providing the transportation the first year the transportation is provided and at least 65 percent of the short term avoidable loss each of the following years, and, except as provided in section 24104(a) of this title, at least 50 percent of associated capital costs each year the transportation is provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application submitted by more than one State shall be considered in the same way as an application submitted by one State, without it being necessary for each State to comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions on Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak shall review each application submitted under subsection (a) of this section to decide whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the application complies with subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is a reasonable probability that Amtrak can provide the transportation from available resources.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak may make an agreement with an applicant under this section to begin or keep the transportation if Amtrak decides that the transportation can be provided with resources available to Amtrak. An agreement may be renewed for additional periods of not more than 2 years each.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Selecting Among Competing Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If more than one application is made for transportation consistent with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, but all the transportation applied for cannot be provided with the available resources of Amtrak, the board of directors of Amtrak shall select the transportation that best serves the public interest and can be provided with the available resources of Amtrak.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Fare Increases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Before increasing a fare applicable to transportation provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section by more than 5 percent during a 6-month period, Amtrak shall consult with officials of each State affected by the increase and explain why the increase is necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a fare increase described in paragraph (1) of this subsection takes effect 90 days after Amtrak first consults with the affected States. However, not later than 30 days after the first consultation, a State may submit proposals to Amtrak for reducing costs and increasing revenues of the transportation. Amtrak shall consider the proposals in deciding how much of the proposed increase shall go into effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Amtrak may increase a fare without regard to the restrictions of this subsection during&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the first month of a fiscal year if the authorization of appropriations and the appropriations for Amtrak are not enacted at least 90 days before the beginning of the fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the 30 days following enactment of an appropriation for Amtrak or a rescission of an appropriation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Amtrak shall notify each affected State of an increase under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph as soon as possible after Amtrak decides to increase a fare.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Determining Loss, Costs, and Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After consulting with officials of each State contributing to providing transportation under subsection (b)(2) of this section, the board shall establish the basis for determining short term avoidable loss and associated capital costs of, and revenues from, the transportation. Amtrak shall give State officials the basis for determining the loss, cost, and revenue for each route on which transportation is provided under subsection (b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts provided by Amtrak under an agreement with an applicant under subsection (b)(2) of this section that are allocated for associated capital costs remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Advertising and Promotion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 2 percent but not more than 5 percent of the revenue generated by transportation provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be used for advertising and promotion at the local level.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Routes Recommended for Discontinuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To maintain a national intercity rail passenger system in the United States and if a reduction in operating expenses can be achieved, Amtrak shall provide rail passenger transportation over each route the Secretary of Transportation recommended be discontinued under section 4 of the Amtrak Improvement Act of 1978 and may restructure a route to serve a major population center as an ending place or principal intermediate place. Transportation over a long distance route shall be maintained if the Amtrak estimate for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, was that the short term avoidable loss for each passenger mile on the route was not more than 7 cents. Transportation over a short distance route shall be maintained if the Amtrak estimate for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, was that the short term avoidable loss for each passenger mile on the route was not more than 9 cents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For all routes, Amtrak shall calculate short term avoidable loss for each passenger-mile based on consistently defined factors. Calculations shall be based on the most recent available statistics for a 90-day period, except that Amtrak may use historical information adjusted to reflect the most recent available statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Deferral of Secretary's Recommendations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To provide equivalent or improved transportation consistent with the goals of section 4(a) of the Act, Amtrak may defer carrying out a recommendation of the Secretary under section 4 of the Act that requires providing transportation over a rail line not used in intercity rail passenger transportation on May 24, 1979, requires using a new facility, or requires making a new labor agreement, until any necessary capital improvements are made in the line or facility or the agreement is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding another law and the route and service criteria, during the period a decision of the Secretary under section 4 of the Act is deferred, Amtrak shall provide substitute transportation over existing routes recommended for restructuring and over other existing feasible routes. Except for transportation concentrating on commuter ridership over a short haul route, transportation provided under this paragraph may be provided only if the route complies with subsection (a) of this section, adjusted to reflect constant 1979 dollars.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Short Haul Demonstration Routes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding this part, Amtrak may provide short haul trains on additional routes totaling not more than 200 miles that link at least 2 major metropolitan areas&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on a demonstration basis to establish the feasibility and benefits of the transportation; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak shall notify each affected State or regional or local transportation authority of a discontinuance under this subsection as soon as possible after Amtrak decides to discontinue the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Employee Protective Arrangements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak or a rail carrier (including a terminal company) shall provide fair and equitable arrangements to protect the interests of employees of Amtrak or a rail carrier, as the case may be, affected by a discontinuance of intercity rail passenger service, including a discontinuance of service provided by a rail carrier under a facility or service agreement under section 24308(a) of this title under a modification or ending of the agreement or because Amtrak begins providing that service. Arrangements shall include provisions that may be necessary for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Route Reviews</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall review annually each route in the basic system to decide if the route meets the long distance or short distance route criterion, as appropriate, under section 24705(a)(1) of this title, adjusted to reflect constant 1979 dollars. The review shall include an evaluation of the potential market demand for, and the cost of providing transportation on, a part of the route and an alternative route. Amtrak shall submit the results of the review to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Secretary of Transportation. If Amtrak decides that a route will not meet the criterion under section 24705(a)(1), as adjusted, Amtrak shall modify or discontinue rail passenger transportation operations on the route so that it will meet the criterion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Financial Requirements and Performance Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after the beginning of each fiscal year, Amtrak shall evaluate the financial requirements for operating the basic system and the progress in achieving the system-wide performance standards prescribed under this part during the fiscal year. If Amtrak decides amounts available for the fiscal year are not enough to meet estimated operating costs, or if Amtrak estimates it cannot meet the performance standards, Amtrak shall act to reduce costs and improve performance. Action under this subsection shall be designed to continue the maximum level of transportation practicable, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) changing the frequency of transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) increasing fares;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reducing the cost of sleeper car and dining car service on certain routes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increasing the passenger capacity of cars used on certain routes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) modifying the route system or discontinuing transportation over routes, considering short term avoidable loss and the number of passengers served on those routes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Cost Limitations and Revenue Goals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Annual costs of Amtrak may not be more than amounts, including grants made under section 24104 of this title, contributions of States, regional and local authorities, and other persons, and revenues, available to Amtrak in the fiscal year. Amtrak annually shall set a goal of recovering an amount so that its revenues, including contributions, is at least 61 percent of its costs, except capital costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Conductor Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To assess the operational performance of trains, the President of Amtrak may direct the conductor on any train of Amtrak to report to Amtrak any inadequacy of train operation. The report shall be signed by the conductor, contain sufficient information to locate equipment or personnel failures, and be submitted promptly to Amtrak.</p>
