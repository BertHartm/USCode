<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A carrier may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval and authority to make a change under this subchapter. To approve a proposed change, the Commission must find that the proposed change&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is within the scope of section 11361 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will be in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will be in the best interests of the carrier, of each class of its stockholders, and of the holders of each class of the carrier's obligations that are affected by the change; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will not be against the interests of a creditor of the carrier who is not affected by the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the change involves an issuance of securities, the Commission must also make the findings required under section 11301(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission shall begin a proceeding under this section on receipt of an application but may require an applicant to get assurances of assent to the change from the holders of the outstanding shares of the securities that will be affected by the change before continuing with the proceeding. The Commission may determine the percentage of the principal amount or number of those shares needed to establish assurance of assent to the change. A class of securities is considered to be affected by a proposed change only if the change is proposed to a part of that class or to a part of an instrument under which that class was issued or by which it is secured. However, if a proposed change is to an instrument under which at least 2 classes of securities were issued and are outstanding or secured by that instrument, only those classes to which the change is related are considered to be affected. The Commission shall divide the securities to be affected by a proposed change under this subchapter into reasonable classes for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receipt of an application of a carrier under this section the Commission shall notify, and file a copy of the application with, the chief executive officer of each State in which that carrier operates. The appropriate authorities of those States are entitled to be admitted as parties to a proceeding under this section to represent the rights and interests of their people and States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The carrier must give notice of the proceeding to the holders of the class of securities affected. The Commission may direct the carrier to give notice to other persons the Commission determines to have an interest in the proceeding. The carrier may give notice under this subsection only after it gets assurances of assent when they are required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may impose conditions governing the proposed change. The Commission may determine the effective date for a change it approves and authorizes under this subchapter and may allow it to become effective on publication of a declaration to that effect by the carrier. After an application is approved, the Commission may change a condition imposed and impose supplemental requirements for good cause shown subject to the requirements of this subchapter.</p>
