<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person domiciled in a country contiguous to the United States and providing transportation to which a minimum level of financial responsibility under this section applies shall have evidence of financial responsibility in the motor vehicle when the person is providing the transportation.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A motor carrier may obtain the required amount of financial responsibility from more than one source provided the cumulative amount is equal to the minimum requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Civil Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary of Transportation finds that a person (except an employee acting without knowledge) has knowingly violated this section or a regulation prescribed under this section, the person is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Transportation may compromise the penalty before referring the matter to the Attorney General for collection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Attorney General shall bring a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States to collect a penalty referred to the Attorney General for collection under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The amount of the penalty may be deducted from amounts the Government owes the person. An amount collected under this section shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
