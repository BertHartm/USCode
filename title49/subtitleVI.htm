However, the Secretary may prescribe, for a motor vehicle operated by a carrier subject to subchapter II of chapter 105, a safety regulation that imposes a higher standard of performance after manufacture than that required by an applicable standard in effect at the time of manufacture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When a motor vehicle safety standard is in effect under this chapter, a State or a political subdivision of a State may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment only if the standard is identical to the standard prescribed under this chapter. However, the United States Government, a State, or a political subdivision of a State may prescribe a standard for a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement than that required by the otherwise applicable standard under this chapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe motor vehicle safety standards. Each standard shall be practicable, meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and be stated in objective terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Considerations and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a motor vehicle safety standard under this chapter, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider relevant available motor vehicle safety information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with the agency established under the Act of August 20, 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;684, 72 Stat. 635), and other appropriate State or interstate authorities (including legislative committees);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider whether a proposed standard is reasonable, practicable, and appropriate for the particular type of motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment for which it is prescribed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the extent to which the standard will carry out section 30101 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may advise, assist, and cooperate with departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government, States, and other public and private agencies in developing motor vehicle safety standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effective Dates of Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall specify the effective date of a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter in the order prescribing the standard. A standard may not become effective before the 180th day after the standard is prescribed or later than one year after it is prescribed. However, the Secretary may prescribe a different effective date after finding, for good cause shown, that a different effective date is in the public interest and publishing the reasons for the finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) 5-<cap-smallcap>Year Plan for Testing Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish and periodically review and update on a continuing basis a 5-year plan for testing motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter that the Secretary considers capable of being tested. In developing the plan and establishing testing priorities, the Secretary shall consider factors the Secretary considers appropriate, consistent with section 30101 of this title and the Secretary's other duties and powers under this chapter. The Secretary may change at any time those priorities to address matters the Secretary considers of greater priority. The initial plan may be the 5-year plan for compliance testing in effect on December 18, 1991.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;30113. General exemptions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;low-emission motor vehicle&rdquo; means a motor vehicle meeting the standards for new motor vehicles applicable to the vehicle under section 202 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521) when the vehicle is manufactured and emitting an air pollutant in an amount significantly below one of those standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Exempt and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may exempt, on a temporary basis, motor vehicles from a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter on terms the Secretary considers appropriate. An exemption may be renewed. A renewal may be granted only on reapplication and must conform to the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may begin a proceeding under this subsection when a manufacturer applies for an exemption or a renewal of an exemp<!-- PDFPage:488 -->tion. The Secretary shall publish notice of the application and provide an opportunity to comment. An application for an exemption or for a renewal of an exemption shall be filed at a time and in the way, and contain information, this section and the Secretary require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may act under this subsection on finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an exemption is consistent with the public interest and this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) compliance with the standard would cause substantial economic hardship to a manufacturer that has tried to comply with the standard in good faith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the exemption would make easier the development or field evaluation of a new motor vehicle safety feature providing a safety level at least equal to the safety level of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the exemption would make the development or field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle easier and would not unreasonably lower the safety level of that vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) compliance with the standard would prevent the manufacturer from selling a motor vehicle with an overall safety level at least equal to the overall safety level of nonexempt vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contents of Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer applying for an exemption under subsection (b) of this section shall include the following information in the application:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section, a complete financial statement describing the economic hardship and a complete description of the manufacturer's good faith effort to comply with each motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter from which the manufacturer is requesting an exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii) of this section, a record of the research, development, and testing establishing the innovative nature of the safety feature and a detailed analysis establishing that the safety level of the feature at least equals the safety level of the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(iii) of this section, a record of the research, development, and testing establishing that the motor vehicle is a low-emission motor vehicle and that the safety level of the vehicle is not lowered unreasonably by exemption from the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the application is made under subsection (b)(3)(B)(iv) of this section, a detailed analysis showing how the vehicle provides an overall safety level at least equal to the overall safety level of nonexempt vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer is eligible for an exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section only if the Secretary determines that the manufacturer's total motor vehicle production in the most recent year of production is not more than 10,000. A manufacturer is eligible for an exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section only if the Secretary determines the exemption is for not more than 2,500 vehicles to be sold in the United States in any 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An exemption or renewal under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section may be granted for not more than 3 years. An exemption or renewal under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may be granted for not more than 2 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may make public, by the 10th day after an application is filed, information contained in the application or relevant to the application unless the information concerns or is related to a trade secret or other confidential information not relevant to the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Notice of Decision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of each decision granting an exemption under this section and the reasons for granting it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Permanent Label Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require a permanent label to be fixed to a motor vehicle granted an exemption under this section. The label shall either name or describe each motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter from which the vehicle is exempt. The Secretary may require that written notice of an exemption be delivered by appropriate means to the dealer and the first purchaser of the vehicle other than for resale.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Providing Information and Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may require that each manufacturer of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment provide technical information related to performance and safety required to carry out this chapter. The Secretary may require the manufacturer to give the following notice of that information when the Secretary decides it is necessary:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to each prospective purchaser of a vehicle or equipment before the first sale other than for resale at each location at which the vehicle or equipment is offered for sale by a person having a legal relationship with the manufacturer, in a way the Secretary decides is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the first purchaser of a vehicle or equipment other than for resale when the vehicle or equipment is bought, in printed matter placed in the vehicle or attached to or accompanying the equipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Maintaining Purchaser Records and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer of a motor vehicle or tire (except a retreaded tire) shall cause to be maintained a record of the name and address of the first purchaser of each vehicle or tire it produces and, to the extent prescribed by regulations of the Secretary, shall cause to be maintained a record of the name and address of the first purchaser of replacement equipment (except a tire) that the manufacturer produces. The Secretary may prescribe by regulation the records to be maintained and reasonable procedures for maintaining the records under this subsection, including procedures to be followed by distributors and dealers to assist the manufacturer in obtaining the information required by this subsection. A procedure shall be reasonable for the type of vehicle or tire involved, and shall provide reasonable assurance that a customer list of a distributor or dealer, or similar information, will be made available to a person (except the distributor or dealer) only when necessary to carry out this subsection and sections 30118&ndash;30121, 30166(f), and 30167(a) and (b) of this title. Availability of assistance from a distributor or dealer does not affect an obligation of a manufacturer under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Secretary may require a distributor or dealer to maintain a record under <!-- PDFPage:491 -->paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the business of the distributor or dealer is owned or controlled by a manufacturer of tires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall require each distributor and dealer whose business is not owned or controlled by a manufacturer of tires to give a registration form (containing the tire identification number) to the first purchaser of a tire. The Secretary shall prescribe the form, which shall be standardized for all tires and designed to allow the purchaser to complete and return it directly to the manufacturer of the tire. The manufacturer shall give sufficient copies of forms to distributors and dealers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall evaluate from time to time how successful the procedures under paragraph (2) of this subsection have been in helping to maintain records about first purchasers of tires. After each evaluation, the Secretary shall decide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the extent to which distributors and dealers have complied with the procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have encouraged first purchasers of tires to register the tires; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may prescribe a requirement under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only if the Secretary decides it is necessary to reduce the risk to motor vehicle safety, after considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the cost of the requirement to manufacturers and the burden of the requirement on distributors and dealers, compared to the increase in the percentage of first purchasers of tires about whom records would be maintained as a result of the requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have complied with the procedures in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the extent to which distributors and dealers have encouraged first purchasers of tires to register the tires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A manufacturer of tires shall reimburse distributors and dealers of that manufacturer's tires for all reasonable costs incurred by the distributors and dealers in complying with a requirement prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) After making a decision under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall submit to each House of Congress a report containing a detailed statement of the decision and an explanation of the reasons for the decision.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notification by Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall notify the manufacturer of a motor vehicle or replacement equipment immediately after making an initial decision (through testing, inspection, investigation, or research carried out under this chapter, examining communications under section 30166(f) of this title, or otherwise) that the vehicle or equipment contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter. The notification shall include the information on which the deci<!-- PDFPage:492 -->sion is based. The Secretary shall publish a notice of each decision under this subsection in the Federal Register. Subject to section 30167(a) of this title, the notification and information are available to any interested person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Defect and Noncompliance Proceedings and Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may make a final decision that a motor vehicle or replacement equipment contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter only after giving the manufacturer an opportunity to present information, views, and arguments showing that there is no defect or noncompliance or that the defect does not affect motor vehicle safety. Any interested person also shall be given an opportunity to present information, views, and arguments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary decides under paragraph (1) of this subsection that the vehicle or equipment contains the defect or does not comply, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give notification under section 30119 of this title to the owners, purchasers, and dealers of the vehicle or equipment of the defect or noncompliance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) remedy the defect or noncompliance under section 30120 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification by Manufacturer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer of a motor vehicle or replacement equipment shall notify the Secretary by certified mail, and the owners, purchasers, and dealers of the vehicle or equipment as provided in section 30119(d) of this section, if the manufacturer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) learns the vehicle or equipment contains a defect and decides in good faith that the defect is related to motor vehicle safety; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) decides in good faith that the vehicle or equipment does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary shall exempt the manufacturer from this section if the Secretary decides a defect or noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. The Secretary may take action under this subsection only after notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for any interested person to present information, views, and arguments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Hearings About Meeting Notification Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the motion of the Secretary or on petition of any interested person, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the notification requirements under this section. Any interested person may make written and oral presentations of information, views, and arguments on whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the notification requirements. If the Secretary decides that the manufacturer has not reasonably met the notification requirements, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer to take specified action to meet those requirements and may take any other action authorized under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the earliest date on which the defect or noncompliance will be remedied without charge, and for tires, the period during which the defect or noncompliance will be remedied without charge under section 30120 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the procedure the recipient of a notice is to follow to inform the Secretary of Transportation when a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer does not remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge under section 30120 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) other information the Secretary prescribes by regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Ways To Remedy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, when notification of a defect or noncompliance is required under section 30118(b) or (c) of this title, the manufacturer of the defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment shall remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge when the vehicle or equipment is presented for remedy. Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the manufacturer shall remedy the defect or noncompliance in any of the following ways the manufacturer chooses:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if a vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by repairing the vehicle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) by replacing the vehicle with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) by refunding the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if replacement equipment, by repairing the equipment or replacing the equipment with identical or reasonably equivalent equipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations to allow the manufacturer to impose conditions on the replacement of a motor vehicle or refund of its price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Tire Remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer of a tire, including an original equipment tire, shall remedy a defective or noncomplying tire if the owner or purchaser presents the tire for remedy not later than 60 days after the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the day the owner or purchaser receives notification under section 30119 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the manufacturer decides to replace the tire, the day the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement is available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the manufacturer decides to replace the tire and the replacement is not available during the 60-day period, the owner or purchaser must present the tire for remedy during a subsequent 60-day period that begins only after the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement will be available during the subsequent period. If tires are available during the subsequent period, only a tire presented for remedy during that period must be remedied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Adequacy of Repairs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a manufacturer decides to repair a defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment and the repair is not done adequately within a reasonable time, the manufacturer shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) replace the vehicle or equipment without charge with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle or equipment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for a vehicle, refund the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Failure to repair a motor vehicle or replacement equipment adequately not later than 60 days after its presentation is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. However, the Secretary may extend, by order, the 60-day period if good cause for an extension is shown and the reason is published in the Federal Register before the period ends. Presentation of a vehicle or equipment for repair before the date specified by a manufacturer in a notice under section 30119(a)(5) or 30121(c)(2) <!-- PDFPage:495 -->of this title is not a presentation under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Filing Manufacturer's Remedy Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer shall file with the Secretary a copy of the manufacturer's program under this section for remedying a defect or noncompliance. The Secretary shall make the program available to the public and publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Hearings About Meeting Remedy Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the motion of the Secretary or on application by any interested person, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the remedy requirements under this section. Any interested person may make written and oral presentations of information, views, and arguments on whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the remedy requirements. If the Secretary decides a manufacturer has not reasonably met the remedy requirements, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer to take specified action to meet those requirements and may take any other action authorized under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Fair Reimbursement to Dealers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A manufacturer shall pay fair reimbursement to a dealer providing a remedy without charge under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The requirement that a remedy be provided without charge does not apply if the motor vehicle or replacement equipment was bought by the first purchaser more than 8 calendar years, or the tire, including an original equipment tire, was bought by the first purchaser more than 3 calendar years, before notice is given under section 30118(c) of this title or an order is issued under section 30118(b) of this title, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not apply during any period in which enforcement of an order under section 30118(b) of this title is restrained or the order is set aside in a civil action to which section 30121(d) of this title applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary shall exempt the manufacturer from this section if the Secretary decides a defect or noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. The Secretary may take action under this subsection only after notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for any interested person to present information, views, and arguments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Sale or Lease</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If notification is required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title or is required under section 30118(c) of this title and the manufacturer has provided to a dealer notification about a new motor vehicle or new item of replacement equipment in the dealer's possession at the time of notification that contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter, the dealer may sell or lease the motor vehicle or item of replacement equipment only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the defect or noncompliance is remedied as required by this section before delivery under the sale or lease; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the notification is required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title, enforcement of the order is restrained or the order is set aside in a civil action to which section 30121(d) of this title applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not prohibit a dealer from offering for sale or lease the vehicle or equipment.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Provisional Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may order a manufacturer to issue a provisional notification if a civil action about an order issued under section 30118(b) of this title has been brought under section 30163 of this title. The provisional notification shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement that the Secretary has decided that a defect related to motor vehicle safety or noncompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter exists and that the manufacturer is contesting the decision in a civil action in a United States district court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a clear description of the Secretary's stated basis for the decision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary's evaluation of the risk to motor vehicle safety reasonably related to the defect or noncompliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) measures the Secretary considers necessary to avoid an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety resulting from the defect or noncompliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a statement that the manufacturer will remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge under section 30120 of this title, but that the requirement to remedy without charge is conditioned on the outcome of the civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) other information the Secretary prescribes by regulation or includes in the order requiring the notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A notification under this subsection does not relieve a manufacturer of liability for not giving notification required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions for Not Notifying</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer that does not notify owners and purchasers under section 30119(c) and (d) of this title is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty, unless the manufacturer prevails in a civil action referred to in subsection (a) of this section or the court in that action enjoins enforcement of the order. Enforcement may be enjoined only if the court decides that the failure to notify is reasonable and that the manufacturer has demonstrated the likelihood of prevailing on the merits. If enforcement is enjoined, the manufacturer is not liable during the time the order is stayed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A manufacturer that does not notify owners and purchasers as required under subsection (a) of this section is liable for a civil penalty regardless of whether the manufacturer prevails in an action on the validity of the order issued under section 30118(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Orders to Manufacturers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary prevails in a civil action referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to notify each owner, purchaser, and dealer described in section 30119(d) of this title of the outcome of the action and other information the Secretary requires, and notification under this clause may be combined with notification required under section 30118(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to specify the earliest date under section 30119(b) of this title on which the defect or noncompliance will be remedied without charge under section 30120 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if notification was required under subsection (a) of this section, to reimburse an owner or purchaser for reasonable and necessary expenses (in an amount that is not more than the amount specified in the order of the Secretary under subsection (a)) incurred for repairing the defect or noncompliance during the period beginning on the date that notification was required to be issued and ending on the date the owner or purchaser receives the notification under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 30163(c) of this title, a civil action about an order issued under section 30118(b) of this title must be brought in the United States district court for a judicial district in the State in which the manufacturer is incorporated or the District of Columbia. On motion of a party, the court may transfer the action to another district court if good cause is shown. All actions related to the same order under section 30118(b) shall be consolidated in an action in one judicial district <!-- PDFPage:497 -->under an order of the court in which the first action was brought. If the first action is transferred to another court, that court shall issue the consolidation order.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inflatable Restraint Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than September 1, 1993, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe under this chapter an amendment to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 issued under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. The amendment shall require that the automatic occupant crash protection system for both of the front outboard seating positions for each of the following vehicles be an inflatable restraint (with lap and shoulder belts) complying with the occupant protection requirements under section 4.1.2.1 of Standard 208:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 95 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of passenger cars manufactured after August 31, 1996, and before September 1, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 80 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks (except walk-in van-type trucks and vehicles designed to be sold only to the United States Postal Service) with a gross vehicle weight rating of not more than 8,500 pounds and an unloaded vehicle weight of not more than 5,500 pounds manufactured after August 31, 1997, and before September 1, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 100 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of passenger cars manufactured after August 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 100 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of vehicles described in clause (B) of this paragraph manufactured after August 31, 1998.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Manufacturers may not use credits and incentives available before September 1, 1998, under the provisions of Standard 208 (as amended by this section) to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection after August 31, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Owner Manual Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In amending Standard 208, the Secretary of Transportation shall require, to be effective as soon as possible after the amendment is prescribed, that owner manuals for passenger cars, buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks equipped with an inflatable restraint include a statement in an easily understandable format stating that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) either or both of the front outboard seating positions of the vehicle are equipped with an inflatable restraint referred to as an &ldquo;airbag&rdquo; and a lap and shoulder belt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the &ldquo;airbag&rdquo; is a supplemental restraint and is not a substitute for lap and shoulder belts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) lap and shoulder belts also must be used correctly by an occupant in a front outboard seating position to provide restraint or protection from frontal crashes as well as other types of crashes or accidents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) occupants should always wear their lap and shoulder belts, if available, or other safety belts, whether or not there is an inflatable restraint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Seat Belt Use Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that it is in the public interest for each State to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use laws and for the United States Government to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Temporary Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary of Transportation may exempt, on a temporary basis, motor vehicles of that manufacturer from any requirement under subsections (b) and (c) of this section on terms the Secretary considers appropriate. An exemption may be renewed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may grant an exemption under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the Secretary finds that there has been a disruption in the supply of any component of an inflatable restraint or in the use and installation of that component by the manufacturer because of an unavoidable event not under the control of the manufacturer that will prevent the manufacturer from meeting its anticipated production volume of vehicles with those restraints.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Only an affected manufacturer may apply for an exemption. The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe in the amendment to Standard 208 required under this section the information an affected manufacturer must include in its application under this subsection. The manufacturer shall specify in the application the models, lines, and types of vehicles affected. The Secretary may consolidate similar applications from different manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An exemption or renewal of an exemption is conditioned on the commitment of the manufacturer to recall the exempted vehicles for installation of the omitted inflatable restraints within a reasonable time that the manufacturer proposes and the Secretary of Transportation approves after the components become available in sufficient quantities to satisfy both anticipated production and recall volume requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of Transportation shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of each application under this subsection and each decision to grant or deny a temporary exemption and the reasons for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary of Transportation shall require a label for each exempted vehicle that can be removed only after recall and installation of the required inflatable restraint. The Secretary shall require that written notice of the exemption be provided to the dealer and the first purchaser of each exempted vehicle other than for resale, with the notice being provided in a way, and containing the information, the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) This section revises, but does not replace, Standard 208 as in effect on December 18, 1991, including the amendment of March 26, 1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 12472), to Standard 208, extending the requirements for automatic <!-- PDFPage:501 -->crash protection, with incentives for more innovative automatic crash protection, to trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles. This section may not be construed as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) affecting another provision of law carried out by the Secretary of Transportation applicable to passenger cars, buses, multipurpose passenger vehicles, or trucks; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establishing a precedent related to developing or prescribing a Government motor vehicle safety standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section and amendments to Standard 208 made under this section may not be construed as indicating an intention by Congress to affect any liability of a motor vehicle manufacturer under applicable law related to vehicles with or without inflatable restraints.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On October 1, 1992, and every 6 months after that date through October 1, 2000, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit reports on the effectiveness of occupant restraint systems expressed as a percentage reduction in fatalities or injuries of restrained occupants compared to unrestrained occupants for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a combination of inflated restraints and lap and shoulder belts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inflated restraints only; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) lap and shoulder belts only.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Defense, the Secretary of Transportation also shall provide information and analysis on lap and shoulder belt use, nationally and in each State by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) military personnel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Government, State, and local law enforcement officers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) other Government and State employees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the public.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Airbags for Government Cars</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In cooperation with the Administrator of General Services and the heads of appropriate departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish a program, consistent with applicable procurement laws of the Government and available appropriations, requiring that all passenger cars acquired&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after September 30, 1994, for use by the Government be equipped, to the maximum extent practicable, with driver-side inflatable restraints; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after September 30, 1996, for use by the Government be equipped, to the maximum extent practicable, with inflatable restraints for both front outboard seating positions.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 30112(a) of this title does not apply to a motor vehicle if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on petition of a manufacturer or importer registered under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary decides&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the vehicle is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for import into and sale in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) certified under section 30115 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the same model year (as defined under regulations of the Secretary of Transportation) as the model of the motor vehicle it is being compared to; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) capable of being readily altered to comply with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if there is no substantially similar United States motor vehicle, the safety features of the vehicle comply with or are capable of being altered to comply with those standards based on destructive test information or other evidence the Secretary of Transportation decides is adequate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the vehicle is imported by a registered importer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the registered importer pays the annual fee the Secretary of Transportation establishes under subsection (e) of this section to pay for the costs of carrying out the registration program for importers under subsection (c) of this section and any other fees the Secretary of Transportation establishes to pay for the costs of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) processing bonds provided to the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) making the decisions under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Procedures on Deciding on Motor Vehicle Capability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall establish by regulation procedures for making a decision under subsection (a)(1) of this section and the information a petitioner must provide to show clearly that the motor vehicle is capable of being brought into compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter. In establishing the procedures, the Secretary shall provide for a minimum period of public notice and written comment consistent with ensuring expeditious, but complete, consideration and avoiding delay by any person. In making a decision under those procedures, the Secretary shall consider test information and other information available to the Secretary, including any information provided by the manufacturer. If the Secretary makes a negative decision, the Secretary may not make another decision for the same model until at least 3 calendar months have elapsed after the negative decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall publish each year in the Federal Register a list of all decisions made under subsection (a)(1) of this section. Each published decision applies to the model of the motor vehicle for which the decision was made. A positive decision permits another importer registered under subsection (c) of this section to import a vehicle of the same model under this section if the importer complies with all the terms of the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Registration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall establish procedures for registering a person who complies with requirements prescribed by the Secretary by regulation under this subsection, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) recordkeeping requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inspection of records and facilities related to motor vehicles the person has imported, altered, or both; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) requirements that ensure that the importer (or a successor in interest) will be able technically and financially to carry out responsibilities under sections 30117(b), 30118&ndash;30121, and 30166(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall deny registration to a person whose registration is revoked under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Transportation may deny registration to a person that is or was owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or control with, a person whose registration was revoked under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Transportation shall establish procedures for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) revoking or suspending a registration issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection for not complying with a requirement of this subchapter or any of sections 30112, 30115, 30117&ndash;30122, 30125(c), 30127, or 30166 of this title or regulations prescribed under this subchapter or any of those sections;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) automatically suspending a registration for not paying a fee under subsection (a)(3) of this section in a timely manner or for knowingly filing a false or misleading certification under section 30146 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) reinstating suspended registrations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Bonds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person importing a motor vehicle under this section shall provide a bond to the Secretary of the Treasury (acting for the Secretary of Transportation) and comply with the terms the Secretary of Transportation decides are appropriate to ensure that the vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will comply with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter within a reasonable time (specified by the Secretary of Transportation) after the vehicle is imported; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will be exported (at no cost to the United States Government) by the Secretary of the Treasury or abandoned to the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of the bond provided under this subsection shall be at least equal to the dutiable <!-- PDFPage:503 -->value of the motor vehicle (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury) but not more than 150 percent of that value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Fee Review, Adjustment, and Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall review and make appropriate adjustments at least every 2 years in the amounts of the fees required to be paid under subsection (a)(3) of this section. The Secretary of Transportation shall establish the fees for each fiscal year before the beginning of that year. All fees collected remain available until expended without fiscal year limit to the extent provided in advance by appropriation laws. The amounts are only for use by the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in carrying out this section and sections 30146(a)&ndash;(c)(1), (d), and (e) and 30147(b) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in advancing to the Secretary of the Treasury amounts for costs incurred under this section and section 30146 of this title to reimburse the Secretary of the Treasury for those costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compliance Certification and Bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, an importer registered under section 30141(c) of this title may license or register an imported motor vehicle for use on public streets, roads, or highways, or release custody of a motor vehicle imported by the registered importer or imported by an individual under section 30142 of this title and altered by the registered importer to meet applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter to a person for license or registration for use on public streets, roads, or highways, only after 30 days after the registered importer certifies to the Secretary of Transportation, in the way the Secretary prescribes, that the motor vehicle complies with each standard prescribed in the year the vehicle was manufactured and that applies in that year to that vehicle. A vehicle may not be released if the Secretary gives written notice before the end of the 30-day period that the Secretary will inspect the vehicle under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretaries of Transportation and the Treasury shall prescribe regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensuring the release of a motor vehicle and bond required under section 30141(d) of this title at the end of the 30-day period, unless the Secretary of Transportation issues a notice of an inspection under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) providing that the Secretary of Transportation shall release the vehicle and bond promptly after an inspection under subsection (c) of this section showing compliance with the standards applicable to the vehicle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each registered importer shall include on each motor vehicle released under this subsection a label prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation identifying the importer and stating that the vehicle has been altered by the importer to comply with the standards applicable to the vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reliance on Manufacturer's Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the registered importer may rely on the manufacturer's certification for the model to which the motor vehicle involved is substantially similar if the importer certifies that any alteration made by the importer did not affect the compliance of the safety features of the vehicle and the importer keeps records verifying the certification for the period the Secretary of Transportation prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Evidence of Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may require that the certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section be accompanied by evidence of compliance the Secretary considers appropriate or may inspect the certified motor vehicle, or both. If the Secretary gives notice of an inspection, an importer may release the vehicle only after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an inspection showing the motor vehicle complies with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter for which the inspection was made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) release of the vehicle by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall inspect periodically a representative number of motor vehicles for which certifications have been filed under subsection (a)(1) of this section. <!-- PDFPage:506 -->In carrying out a motor vehicle testing program under this chapter, the Secretary shall include a representative number of motor vehicles for which certifications have been filed under subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Challenging the Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A motor vehicle or bond may not be released under subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary of Transportation, not later than 30 days after receiving a certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section, gives written notice that the Secretary believes or has reason to believe that the certification is false or contains a mispresentation. The vehicle and bond may be released only after the Secretary is satisfied with the certification and any modification of the certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Bond Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A release of a bond required under section 30141(d) of this title is deemed an acceptance of a certification or completion of an inspection under this section but is not a decision by the Secretary of Transportation under section 30118(a) or (b) of this title of compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;31105. Employee protections</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may not discharge an employee, or discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding pay, terms, or privileges of employment, because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employee, or another person at the employee's request, has filed a complaint or begun a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety regulation, standard, or order, or has testified or will testify in such a proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employee refuses to operate a vehicle because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the operation violates a regulation, standard, or order of the United States related to commercial motor vehicle safety or health; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle's unsafe condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection, an employee's apprehension of serious injury is reasonable only if a reasonable individual in the circumstances then confronting the employee would conclude that the unsafe condition establishes a real danger of accident, injury, or serious impairment to health. To qualify for protection, the employee must have sought from the employer, and been unable to obtain, correction of the unsafe condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Filing Complaints and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An employee alleging discharge, discipline, or discrimination in violation of subsection (a) of this section, or another person at the employee's request, may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor not later than 180 days after the alleged violation occurred. On receiving the complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person alleged to have committed the violation of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than 60 days after receiving a complaint, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation, decide whether it is reasonable to believe the complaint has merit, and notify the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation of the findings. If the Secretary decides it is reasonable to believe a violation occurred, the Secretary shall include with the decision findings and a preliminary order for the relief provided under paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 30 days after the notice under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of objections does not stay a reinstatement ordered in the preliminary order. If a hearing is not requested within the 30 days, the preliminary order is final and not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A hearing shall be conducted expeditiously. Not later than 120 days after the end of the hearing, the Secretary shall issue a final <!-- PDFPage:528 -->order. Before the final order is issued, the proceeding may be ended by a settlement agreement made by the Secretary, the complainant, and the person alleged to have committed the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the Secretary decides, on the basis of a complaint, a person violated subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall order the person to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) take affirmative action to abate the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) reinstate the complainant to the former position with the same pay and terms and privileges of employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) pay compensatory damages, including back pay.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary issues an order under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the complainant requests, the Secretary may assess against the person against whom the order is issued the costs (including attorney's fees) reasonably incurred by the complainant in bringing the complaint. The Secretary shall determine the costs that reasonably were incurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Review and Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person adversely affected by an order issued after a hearing under subsection (b) of this section may file a petition for review, not later than 60 days after the order is issued, in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the violation occurred or the person resided on the date of the violation. The review shall be heard and decided expeditiously. An order of the Secretary subject to review under this subsection is not subject to judicial review in a criminal or other civil proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Enforce</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person fails to comply with an order issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall bring a civil action to enforce the order in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the violation occurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) imposes a vehicle length limitation of less than 45 feet on a bus, of less than 48 feet on a semitrailer operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer combination, or of less than 28 feet on a semitrailer or trailer operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination, on any segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways (except a segment exempted under subsection (f) of this section) and those classes of qualifying Federal-aid Primary System highways designated by the Secretary of Transportation under subsection (e) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) imposes an overall length limitation on a commercial motor vehicle operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer or truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) has the effect of prohibiting the use of a semitrailer or trailer of the same dimensions as those that were in actual and lawful use in that State on December 1, 1982; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) has the effect of prohibiting the use of an existing semitrailer or trailer, of not more than 28.5 feet in length, in a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination if the semitrailer or trailer was operating lawfully on December 1, 1982, within a 65-foot overall length limit in any State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A length limitation prescribed or enforced by a State under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection applies only to a semitrailer or trailer and not to a truck tractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Maxi-Cube and Vehicle Combination Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may not prohibit a maxi-cube vehicle or a commercial motor vehicle combination consisting of a truck tractor and 2 trailing units on any segment of the Dwight D.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before making a decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the chief executive officer shall consult with units of local government in the State in which the segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is located and with the chief executive officer of any adjacent State that may be directly affected by the exemption. As part of the consultations, consideration shall be given to any potential alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located and can safely accommodate a commercial motor vehicle having a length described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section or the motor vehicle combination described in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A chief executive officer's notification under this subsection must include specific evidence of safety problems supporting the officer's decision and the results of consultations about alternative routes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the Secretary decides, on request of a chief executive officer or on the Secretary's own initiative, a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is not capable of safely accommodating a commercial motor vehicle having a length described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section or the motor vehicle combination described in subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall exempt the segment from either or both of those provisions. Before making a decision under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider any possible alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make a decision about a specific segment not later than 120 days after the date of receipt of notification from a chief executive officer under paragraph (1) of this subsection or the date on which the Secretary initiates action under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, whichever is applicable. If the Secretary finds the decision will not be made in time, the <!-- PDFPage:531 -->Secretary immediately shall notify Congress, giving the reasons for the delay, information about the resources assigned, and the projected date for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Before making a decision, the Secretary shall give an interested person notice and an opportunity for comment. If the Secretary exempts a segment under this subsection before the final regulations under subsection (e) of this section are prescribed, the Secretary shall include the exemption as part of the final regulations. If the Secretary exempts the segment after the final regulations are prescribed, the Secretary shall publish the exemption as an amendment to the final regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Accommodating Specialized Equipment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In prescribing regulations to carry out this section, the Secretary may make decisions necessary to accommodate specialized equipment, including automobile and vessel transporters and maxi-cube vehicles.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may not allow by any means the operation, on any segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and those classes of qualifying Federal-aid Primary System highways designated by the Secretary of Transportation under section 31111(e) of this title, of any commercial motor vehicle combination (except a vehicle or load that cannot be dismantled easily or divided easily and that has been issued a special permit under applicable State law) with more than one property-carrying unit (not including the truck tractor) whose property-carrying units are more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the maximum combination trailer, semitrailer, or other type of length limitation al<!-- PDFPage:532 -->lowed by law or regulation of that State before June 2, 1991; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the length of the property-carrying units of those commercial motor vehicle combinations, by specific configuration, in actual, lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) in that State before June 2, 1991.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Special Rules for Wyoming, Ohio, and Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to the vehicles allowed under subsection (b) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Wyoming may allow the operation of additional vehicle configurations not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but authorized by State law not later than November 3, 1992, if the vehicle configurations comply with the single axle, tandem axle, and bridge formula limits in section 127(a) of title 23 and are not more than 117,000 pounds gross vehicle weight;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Ohio may allow the operation of commercial motor vehicle combinations with 3 property-carrying units of 28.5 feet each (not including the truck tractor) not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, to be operated in Ohio on the 1-mile segment of Ohio State Route 7 that begins at and is south of exit 16 of the Ohio Turnpike; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Alaska may allow the operation of commercial motor vehicle combinations that were not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but were in actual operation before July 6, 1991.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

However, subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (g)(2) of this section, the State may make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency nature to route designations and vehicle operating restrictions in effect on June 1, 1991, for specific safety purposes and road construction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not prevent a State from further restricting in any way or prohibiting the operation of any commercial motor vehicle combination subject to this section, except that a restriction or prohibition shall be consistent with this section and sections 31113(a) and (b) and 31114 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State making a minor adjustment of a temporary and emergency nature as authorized by paragraph (1) of this subsection or further restricting or prohibiting the operation of a commercial motor vehicle combination as authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection shall advise the Secretary not later than 30 days after the action. The Secretary shall publish a notice of the action in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>List of State Length Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than February 16, 1992, each State shall submit to the Secretary for publication a complete list of State length limitations applicable to commercial motor vehicle combinations operating in the State on the highways described in subsection (b) of this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A law or regulation may not be included on the list submitted by a State or published by the Secretary merely because it authorized, or could have authorized, by permit or otherwise, the operation of commercial motor vehicle combinations not in actual operation on a regular or periodic basis before June 2, 1991.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except as revised under this paragraph or paragraph (5) of this subsection, the list shall be published as final in the Federal Register not later than June 15, 1992. In publishing the final list, the Secretary shall make any revisions necessary to correct inaccuracies identified under paragraph (2) of this subsection. After publication of the final list, commercial motor vehicle combinations prohibited under subsection (b) of this section may not operate on the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and other Federal-aid Primary System highways designated by the Secretary except as published on the list. The list may be combined by the Secretary with the list required under section 127(d) of title 23.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) On the Secretary's own motion or on request by any person (including a State), the Secretary shall review the list published under paragraph (4) of this subsection. If the Secretary decides there is reason to believe a mistake was made in the accuracy of the list, the Secretary shall begin a proceeding to decide whether a mistake was made. If the Secretary decides there was a mistake, the Secretary shall publish the correction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to allow the operation on any segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways of a longer combination vehicle prohibited under section 127(d) of title 23;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to affect in any way the operation of a commercial motor vehicle having only one property-carrying unit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to affect in any way the operation in a State of a commercial motor vehicle with more than one property-carrying unit if the vehicle was in actual operation on a regular or periodic basis (including seasonal operation) in that State before June 2, 1991, that was authorized under State law or regulation or lawful State permit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In carrying out this section only, the Secretary shall define by regulation loads that cannot be dismantled easily or divided easily.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than June 15, 1992, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations establishing criteria <!-- PDFPage:533 -->for a State to follow in making minor adjustments under subsection (d) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a qualifying Federal-aid Primary System highway designated by the Secretary if the Secretary decides the designation is consistent with highway safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a State may continue to enforce a regulation of commerce in effect on April 6, 1983, that applies to a commercial motor vehicle of more than 102 inches in width, until the date on which the State prescribes a regulation of commerce that complies with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A Federal-aid highway (except an interstate highway) not designated under this subsection on June 5, 1984, may be designated under this subsection only with the agreement of the chief executive officer of the State in which the highway is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of Safety and Energy Conservation Devices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Width calculated under this section does not include a safety or energy conservation device the Secretary decides is necessary for safe and efficient operation of a commercial motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Special Use Permits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may grant a special use permit to a commercial motor vehicle that is more than 102 inches in width.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the chief executive officer of a State, after consulting under paragraph (2) of this subsection, decides a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is not capable of safely accommodating a commercial motor vehicle having the width provided in subsection (a) of this section, the chief executive officer may notify the Secretary of that decision and request the Secretary to exempt that segment from subsection (a) to allow the State to impose a width limitation of less than 102 inches for a vehicle (except a bus) on that segment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before making a decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the chief executive officer shall consult with units of local government in the State in which the segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is located and with the chief executive officer of any adjacent State that may be directly affected by the exemption. As part of the consultations, consideration shall be given to any potential alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located and can safely accommodate a commercial motor vehicle having the width provided for in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A chief executive officer's notification under this subsection must include specific evidence of safety problems supporting the officer's decision and the results of consultations about alternative routes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the Secretary decides, on request of a chief executive officer or on the Secretary's own initiative, a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is not capable of safely accommodating a commercial motor vehicle having a width provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall exempt the segment from subsection (a) to allow the State to impose a width limitation of less than 102 inches for a vehicle (except a bus) on that segment. Before making a decision under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider any possible alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make a decision about a specific segment not later than 120 days after the date of receipt of notification from a chief executive officer under paragraph (1) of this subsection or the date on which the Secretary initiates action under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, whichever is applicable. If the Secretary finds the decision will not be made in time, the Secretary immediately shall notify Congress, giving the reasons for the delay, information about the resources assigned, and the projected date for the decision.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:534 --><p class="statutory-body">(C) Before making a decision, the Secretary shall give an interested person notice and an opportunity for comment. If the Secretary exempts a segment under this subsection before the final regulations under subsection (a) of this section are prescribed, the Secretary shall include the exemption as part of the final regulations. If the Secretary exempts the segment after the final regulations are prescribed, the Secretary shall publish the exemption as an amendment to the final regulations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Safety Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to section 30103(a) of this title, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety. The regulations shall prescribe minimum safety standards for commercial motor vehicles. At a minimum, the regulations shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) commercial motor vehicles are maintained, equipped, loaded, and operated safely;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the responsibilities imposed on operators of commercial motor vehicles do not impair their ability to operate the vehicles safely;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the physical condition of operators of commercial motor vehicles is adequate to enable them to operate the vehicles safely; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the operation of commercial motor vehicles does not have a deleterious effect on the physical condition of the operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Eliminating and Amending Existing Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not eliminate or amend an existing motor carrier safety regulation related only to the maintenance, equipment, loading, or operation (including routing) of vehicles carrying material found to be hazardous under section 5103 of this title until an equivalent or more stringent regulation has been prescribed under section 5103.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures and Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A regulation under this section shall be prescribed under section 553 of title 5 (without regard to sections 556 and 557 of title 5).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) costs and benefits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) State laws and regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety, to minimize their unnecessary preemption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Existing Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary does not prescribe regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety under this section, regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety prescribed by the Secretary before October 30, 1984, and in effect on October 30, 1984, shall be deemed in this subchapter to be regulations prescribed by the Secretary under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After notice and an opportunity for comment, the Secretary may waive any part of a regulation prescribed under this section as it applies to a person or class of persons, if the Secretary decides that the waiver is consistent with the public interest and the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. Under this subsection, the Secretary shall waive the regulations prescribed under this section as they apply to schoolbuses (as defined in section 30125(a) of this title) unless the Secretary decides that making the regulations applicable to schoolbuses is necessary for public safety, considering all laws of the United States and States applicable to schoolbuses. A waiver under this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register, with the reasons for the waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on Municipality and Commercial Zone Exemptions and Waivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) exempt a person or commercial motor vehicle from a regulation related to commercial motor vehicle safety only because the operations of the person or vehicle are entirely in a municipality or commercial zone of a municipality; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) waive application to a person or commercial motor vehicle of a regulation related to commercial motor vehicle safety only because the operations of the person or vehicle are entirely in a municipality or commercial zone of a municipality.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a person was authorized to operate a commercial motor vehicle in a municipality or commercial zone of a municipality in the United States for the entire period from November 19, 1987, through November 18, 1988, and if the person is otherwise qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle, the person may operate a commercial motor vehicle entirely in a municipality or commercial zone of a municipality notwithstanding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a minimum age requirement of the United States Government for operation of the vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a medical or physical condition that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) would prevent an operator from operating a commercial motor vehicle under the <!-- PDFPage:538 -->commercial motor vehicle safety regulations in title 49, Code of Federal Regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) existed on July 1, 1988;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) has not substantially worsened; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) does not involve alcohol or drug abuse.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Inspection of Safety Equipment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the instruction of an authorized enforcement official of a State or of the United States Government, a commercial motor vehicle is required to pass an inspection of all safety equipment required under part 393 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inspection of Vehicles and Record Retention</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations on Government standards for inspection of commercial motor vehicles and retention by employers of records of an inspec<!-- PDFPage:543 -->tion. The standards shall provide for annual or more frequent inspections of a commercial motor vehicle unless the Secretary finds that another inspection system is as effective as an annual or more frequent inspection system. Regulations prescribed under this subsection are deemed to be regulations prescribed under section 31136 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, this subchapter and section 31102 of this title do not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prevent a State or voluntary group of States from imposing more stringent standards for use in their own periodic roadside inspection programs of commercial motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prevent a State from enforcing a program for inspection of commercial motor vehicles that the Secretary decides is as effective as the Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) prevent a State from enforcing a program for inspection of commercial motor vehicles that meets the requirements for membership in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, as those requirements were in effect on October 30, 1984; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) require a State that is enforcing a program described in clause (B) or (C) of this paragraph to enforce a Government standard prescribed under subsection (b) of this section or to adopt a provision on inspection of commercial motor vehicles in addition to that program to comply with the Government standards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section shall preempt a program of a State described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection as the program applies to the inspection of commercial motor vehicles in that State. The State may not enforce the program if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decides, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that the State is not enforcing the program in a way that achieves the objectives of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after making a decision under clause (A) of this paragraph, provides the State with a 6-month period to improve the enforcement of the program to achieve the objectives of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Inspection To Be Accepted as Adequate in All States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A periodic inspection of a commercial motor vehicle under the Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section or a program described in subsection (c)(1)(B) or (C) of this section that is being enforced shall be recognized as adequate in every State for the period of the inspection. This subsection does not prohibit a State from making random inspections of commercial motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Government Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section may not be enforced as the standards apply to the inspection of commercial motor vehicles in a State enforcing a program described in subsection (c)(1)(B) or (C) of this section if the Secretary decides that it is in the public interest and consistent with public safety for the Government standards not to be enforced as they apply to that inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application of State Regulations to Government-Leased Vehicles and Operators</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State receiving financial assistance under section 31102 of this title in a fiscal year may enforce in that fiscal year a regulation on commercial motor vehicle safety adopted by the State as the regulation applies to commercial motor vehicles and operators leased to the Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; means any substance under section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802) specified by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Testing Program for Operators of Commercial Motor Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In the interest of commercial motor vehicle safety, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations not later than October 28, 1992, that establish a program requiring motor carriers to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of operators of commercial motor vehicles for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a United States Government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When the Secretary of Transportation considers it appropriate in the interest of safety, the Secretary may prescribe regulations for conducting periodic recurring testing of operators of commercial motor vehicles for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall require that post-accident testing of an operator of a commercial motor vehicle be conducted when loss of human life occurs in an accident involving a commercial motor vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may require that post-accident testing of such an operator be conducted when bodily injury or significant property damage occurs in any other serious accident involving a commercial motor vehicle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Testing and Laboratory Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall develop requirements that shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote, to the maximum extent practicable, individual privacy in the collection of specimens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for laboratories and testing procedures for controlled substances, incorporate the Department of Health and Human Services scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11, 1988, and any amendments to those guidelines, including mandatory guidelines establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comprehensive standards for every aspect of laboratory controlled substances testing and laboratory procedures to be applied in carrying out this section, including standards requiring the use of the best available technology to ensure the complete reliability and accuracy of controlled substances tests and strict procedures governing the chain of custody of specimens collected for controlled substances testing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the minimum list of controlled substances for which individuals may be tested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) appropriate standards and procedures for periodic review of laboratories and criteria for certification and revocation of certification of laboratories to perform controlled substances testing in carrying out this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require that a laboratory involved in testing under this section have the capability and facility, at the laboratory, of performing screening and confirmation tests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that any test indicating the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable of providing quantitative information about alcohol or a controlled substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the confidentiality of test results and medical information (except information about alcohol or a controlled sub<!-- PDFPage:549 -->stance) of employees, except that this clause does not prevent the use of test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) ensure that employees are selected for tests by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that no employee is harassed by being treated differently from other employees in similar circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Testing as Part of Medical Examination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may provide that testing under subsection (a) of this section for operators subject to subpart E of part 391 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, be conducted as part of the medical examination required under that subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Rehabilitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations establishing requirements for rehabilitation programs that provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of operators of commercial motor vehicles who are found to have used alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation. The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which those operators shall be required to participate in a program. This section does not prevent a motor carrier from establishing a program under this section in cooperation with another motor carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Sanctions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall decide on appropriate sanctions for a commercial motor vehicle operator who is found, based on tests conducted and confirmed under this section, to have used alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation but who is not under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance as provided in this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Effect on State and Local Government Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State or local government may not prescribe or continue in effect a law, regulation, standard, or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this section. However, a regulation prescribed under this section may not be construed to preempt a State criminal law that imposes sanctions for reckless conduct leading to loss of life, injury, or damage to property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>International Obligations and Foreign Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In prescribing regulations under this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall establish only requirements that are consistent with international obligations of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall consider applicable laws and regulations of foreign countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Other Regulations Allowed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not prevent the Secretary of Transportation from continuing in effect, amending, or further supplementing a regulation prescribed before October 28, 1991, governing the use of alcohol or a controlled substance by commercial motor vehicle employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Application of Penalties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not supersede a penalty applicable to an operator of a commercial motor vehicle under this chapter or another law.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;as provided in this chapter&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The term &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;common carriers by motor vehicle&rdquo; and &ldquo;contract carriers by motor vehicle&rdquo; because they are inclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;when needed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;if need therefor is found&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;establish&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;for a total distance of&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;more than&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;line&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;possession of the United States&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;a foreign country&rdquo; and &ldquo;the District of Columbia&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because a carrier crossing the boundary of a foreign country or the District of Columbia into or from the United States would necessarily cross the boundary of a State and be covered by the provision related to a State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a make, model, or class of a passenger motor vehicle manufactured for a special use, if the standard would interfere unreasonably with the special use of the vehicle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Cost Reduction and Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a standard under this section, the Secretary shall design the standard to obtain the maximum feasible reduction of costs to the public, considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the costs and benefits of carrying out the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the effect of the standard on insurance costs and legal fees and costs;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 553 of title 5 applies to a standard prescribed under this section. However, the Secretary shall give an interested person an opportunity to make oral and written presentations of information, views, and arguments. A transcript of each oral presentation shall be kept. Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to resolve an issue of fact material to a standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe an effective date for a standard under this section. That date may not be earlier than the date the standard is prescribed nor later than 18 months after the date the standard is prescribed. However, the Secretary may prescribe a later date when the Secretary submits to Congress and publishes the reasons for the later date. A standard only applies to a passenger motor vehicle or passenger motor vehicle equipment manufactured on or after the effective date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Research</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall conduct research necessary to carry out this chapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Written Disclosure Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, a person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle shall give the transferee a written disclosure&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) of the cumulative mileage registered by the odometer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the mileage is unknown if the transferor knows that the mileage registered by the odometer is incorrect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person making a written disclosure required by a regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not make a false statement in the disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person acquiring a motor vehicle for resale may accept a disclosure under this section only if it is complete.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The regulations prescribed by the Secretary shall provide the way in which information is disclosed and retained under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Mileage Statement Requirement for Licensing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A motor vehicle the ownership of which is transferred may not be licensed for use in a State unless the transferee, in submitting an application to a State for the title on which the license will be issued, includes with the ap<!-- PDFPage:576 -->plication the transferor's title and, if that title contains the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection, a statement, signed and dated by the transferor, of the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. This paragraph does not apply to a transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle that has not been licensed before the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the title to a motor vehicle issued to a transferor by a State is in the possession of a lienholder when the transferor transfers ownership of the vehicle, the transferor may use a written power of attorney (if allowed by State law) in making the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. Regulations prescribed under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall prescribe the form of the power of attorney;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall provide that the form be printed by means of a secure printing process (or other secure process);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall provide that the State issue the form to the transferee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) shall provide that the person exercising the power of attorney retain a copy and submit the original to the State with a copy of the title showing the restatement of the mileage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) may require that the State retain the power of attorney and the copy of the title for an appropriate period or that the State adopt alternative measures consistent with section 32701(b) of this title, after considering the costs to the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) shall ensure that the mileage at the time of transfer be disclosed on the power of attorney document;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) shall ensure that the mileage be restated exactly by the person exercising the power of attorney in the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) may not require that a motor vehicle be titled in the State in which the power of attorney was issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ix) shall consider the need to facilitate normal commercial transactions in the sale or exchange of motor vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(x) shall provide other conditions the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Section 32709(a) and (b) applies to a person granting or granted a power of attorney under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A motor vehicle the ownership of which is transferred may be licensed for use in a State only if the title issued by the State to the transferee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is produced by means of a secure printing process (or other secure process);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) indicates the mileage disclosure required to be made under subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) contains a space for the transferee to disclose the mileage at the time of a future transfer and to sign and date the disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph does not require a State to verify, or preclude a State from verifying, the mileage information contained in the title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Leased Motor Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For a leased motor vehicle, the regulations prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall require written disclosure about mileage to be made by the lessee to the lessor when the lessor transfers ownership of that vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under those regulations, the lessor shall provide written notice to the lessee of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the lessee's mileage disclosure requirements under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The lessor shall retain the disclosures made by a lessee under paragraph (1) of this subsection for at least 4 years following the date the lessor transfers the leased motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the lessor transfers ownership of a leased motor vehicle without obtaining possession of the vehicle, the lessor, in making the disclosure required by subsection (a) of this section, may indicate on the title the mileage disclosed by the lessee under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the lessor has reason to believe that the disclosure by the lessee does not reflect the actual mileage of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Alternate Vehicle Mileage Disclosure Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirements of subsections (b) and (c)(1) of this section on the disclosure of motor vehicle mileage when motor vehicles are transferred or leased apply in a State unless the State has in effect alternate motor vehicle mileage disclosure requirements approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall approve alternate motor vehicle mileage disclosure requirements submitted by a State unless the Secretary decides that the requirements are not consistent with the purpose of the disclosure required by subsection (b) or (c), as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Auction Sales</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a motor vehicle is sold at an auction, the auction company conducting the auction shall maintain the following records for at least 4 years after the date of the sale:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the name of the most recent owner of the motor vehicle (except the auction company) and the name of the buyer of the motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the vehicle identification number required under chapter 301 or 331 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the odometer reading on the date the auction company took possession of the motor vehicle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application and Revision of State Law</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, subsections (b)&ndash;(e) of this section apply to the transfer of a motor vehicle after April 28, 1989.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a State requests, the Secretary shall assist the State in revising its laws to comply with subsection (b) of this section. If a State requires time beyond April 28, 1989, to revise its laws to achieve compliance, the Secretary, on request of the State, may grant additional time that the Secretary considers reasonable by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. The notice shall include the reasons for granting the additional time. In granting additional time, the Secretary shall ensure that the State is making reasonable efforts to achieve compliance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; means a valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter sufficient to justify the inspection or impoundment in the circumstances stated in an application for a warrant under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Warrant Requirement and Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, an inspection or impoundment under section 32706 of this title may be carried out only after a warrant is obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A judge of a court of the United States or a State court of record or a United States magistrate may issue a warrant for an inspection or impoundment under section 32706 of this title within the territorial jurisdiction of the court or magistrate. The warrant must be based on an affidavit that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establishes probable cause to issue the warrant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is sworn to before the judge or magistrate by an officer or employee who knows the facts alleged in the affidavit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The judge or magistrate shall issue the warrant when the judge or magistrate decides there is a reasonable basis for believing that probable cause exists to issue the warrant. The warrant must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identify the premises, property, or motor vehicle to be inspected and the items or type of property to be impounded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) state the purpose of the inspection, the basis for issuing the warrant, and the name of the affiant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) direct an individual authorized under section 32706 of this title to inspect the premises, property, or vehicle for the purpose stated in the warrant and, when appropriate, to impound the property specified in the warrant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) direct that the warrant be served during the hours specified in the warrant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) name the judge or magistrate with whom proof of service is to be filed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A warrant under this section is not required when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the premises consents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is reasonable to believe that the mobility of the motor vehicle to be inspected makes it impractical to obtain a warrant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an application for a warrant cannot be made because of an emergency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) records are to be inspected and copied under section 32706(e)(1)(A) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a warrant is not constitutionally required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service and Impoundment of Property</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A warrant issued under this section must be served and proof of service filed not later than 10 days after its issuance date. The judge or magistrate may allow additional time in the warrant if the Secretary of Transportation demonstrates a need for additional time. Proof of service must be filed promptly with a written inventory of the property impounded under the warrant. The inventory shall be made in the presence of the individual serving the warrant and the individual from whose possession or premises the property was impounded, or if that individual is not present, a credible individual except the individual making the inventory. The individual serving the warrant shall verify the inventory. On request, the judge or magistrate shall send a copy of the inventory to the individual from whose possession or premises the property was impounded and to the applicant for the warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When property is impounded under a warrant, the individual serving the warrant shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give the person from whose possession or premises the property was impounded a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the property was impounded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The judge or magistrate shall file the warrant, proof of service, and all documents filed about the warrant with the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which the inspection is made.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;32902. Average fuel economy standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Non-Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 18 months before the beginning of each model year, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by regulation average fuel economy standards for automobiles (except passenger automobiles) manufactured by a manufacturer in that model year. Each standard shall be the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretary decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year. The Secretary may prescribe separate standards for different classes of automobiles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a model year after model year 1984 shall be 27.5 miles a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Amending Passenger Automobile Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending the standard under subsection (b) of this section for a model year to a level that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for that model year. Section 553 of title 5 applies to a proceeding to amend the standard. However, any interested person may make an oral presentation and a transcript shall be taken of that presentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an amendment increases the standard above 27.5 miles a gallon or decreases the standard below 26.0 miles a gallon, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit the amendment to Congress. The procedures of section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6421) apply to an amendment, except that the 15 calendar days referred to in section 551(c) and (d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(c), (d)) are deemed to be 60 calendar days, and the 5 calendar days referred to in section 551(f)(4)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(f)(4)(A)) are deemed to be 20 calendar days. If either House of Congress disapproves the amendment under those procedures, the amendment does not take effect.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:585 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, on application of a manufacturer that manufactured (whether in the United States or not) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the model year 2 years before the model year for which the application is made, the Secretary of Transportation may exempt by regulation the manufacturer from a standard under subsection (b) or (c) of this section. An exemption for a model year applies only if the manufacturer manufactures (whether in the United States or not) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the model year. The Secretary may exempt a manufacturer only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) finds that the applicable standard under those subsections is more stringent than the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the manufacturer can achieve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prescribes by regulation an alternative average fuel economy standard for the passenger automobiles manufactured by the exempted manufacturer that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for the manufacturers to which the alternative standard applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alternative average fuel economy standard the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection may apply to an individually exempted manufacturer, to all automobiles to which this subsection applies, or to classes of passenger automobiles, as defined under regulations of the Secretary, manufactured by exempted manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, an importer registered under section 30141(c) of this title may not be exempted as a manufacturer under paragraph (1) for a motor vehicle that the importer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) imports; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) brings into compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under chapter 301 of this title for an individual under section 30142 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe the contents of an application for an exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;emergency vehicle&rdquo; means an automobile manufactured primarily for use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as an ambulance or combination ambulance-hearse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by the United States Government or a State or local government for law enforcement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for other emergency uses prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A manufacturer may elect to have the fuel economy of an emergency vehicle excluded in applying a fuel economy standard under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section. The election is made by providing written notice to the Secretary of Transportation and to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Considerations on Decisions on Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When deciding maximum feasible average fuel economy under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to conserve energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Requirements for Other Amendments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending an average fuel economy standard prescribed under subsection (a) or (d) of this section if the amended standard meets the requirements of subsection (a) or (d), as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary of Transportation prescribes an amendment under this section that makes an average fuel economy standard more stringent, the Secretary shall prescribe the amendment (and submit the amendment to Congress when required under subsection (c)(2) of this section) at least 18 months before the beginning of the model year to which the amendment applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsections (c), (f), and (g) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not consider the fuel economy of dedicated automobiles; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Earning and Period for Applying Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the average fuel economy of passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a particular model year exceeds an applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title (determined by the Secretary of Transportation without regard to credits under this section), the manufacturer earns credits. The credits may be applied to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any of the 3 consecutive model years immediately before the model year for which the credits are earned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent not used under clause (1) of this subsection, any of the 3 consecutive model years immediately after the model year for which the credits are earned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Period of Availability and Plan for Future Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, credits under this section are available to a manufacturer at the end of the model year in which earned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Before the end of a model year, if a manufacturer has reason to believe that its average fuel economy for passenger automobiles will be less than the applicable standard for that model year, the manufacturer may submit a plan to the Secretary of Transportation demonstrating that the manufacturer will earn sufficient credits under this section within the next 3 model years to allow the manufacturer to meet that standard for the model year involved. Unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer is unlikely to earn sufficient credits under the plan, the Secretary shall approve the plan. Those credits are available for the model year involved if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:587 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary approves the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the manufacturer earns those credits as provided by the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer is less than the applicable standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title after applying credits under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the manufacturer and give the manufacturer a reasonable time (of at least 60 days) to submit a plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determining Number of Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The number of credits a manufacturer earns under this section equals the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of tenths of a mile a gallon by which the average fuel economy of the passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer in the model year in which the credits are earned exceeds the applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title; times</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the number of passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer during that model year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Applying Credits for Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall apply credits to a model year on the basis of the number of tenths of a mile a gallon by which the manufacturer involved was below the applicable average fuel economy standard for that model year and the number of passenger automobiles manufactured that model year by the manufacturer. Credits applied to a model year are no longer available for another model year. Before applying credits, the Secretary shall give the manufacturer written notice and reasonable opportunity to comment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applying Credits for Non-Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Credits for a manufacturer of automobiles that are not passenger automobiles are earned and applied to a model year in which the average fuel economy of that class of automobiles is below the applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(a) of this title, to the same extent and in the same way as provided in this section for passenger automobiles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Refund of Collected Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a civil penalty has been collected under this chapter from a manufacturer that has earned credits under this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall refund to the manufacturer the amount of the penalty to the extent the penalty is attributable to credits available under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Transportation shall grant the exemption unless the Secretary finds that the exemption would result in reduced employment in the United States related to motor vehicle manufacturing during the period of the exemption. An exemption under this paragraph is effective for 5 model years or, if requested by the manufacturer, a longer period provided by the Secretary in the order granting the exemption. The exemption applies to passenger automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer during the period of the exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Before granting an exemption, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide notice of, and reasonable opportunity for, written or oral comment about the petition. The period for comment shall end not later than 60 days after the petition is filed, except that the Secretary may extend the period for not more than another 30 days. The Secretary shall decide whether to grant or deny the exemption, and publish notice of the decision in the Federal Register, not later than 90 days after the petition is filed, except that the Secretary may extend the time for decision to a later date (not later than 150 days after the petition is filed) if the Secretary publishes notice of, and reasons for, the extension in the Federal Register. If the Secretary does not make a decision within the time provided in this subparagraph, the petition is deemed to have been granted. Not later than 30 days after the end of the decision period, the Secretary shall submit a written statement of the reasons for not making a decision to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) A person adversely affected by a decision of the Secretary of Transportation granting or denying an exemption may file, not later than 30 days after publication of the notice of the decision, a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court has exclusive jurisdiction to review the decision and to affirm, remand, or set aside the decision under section 706(2)(A)&ndash;(D) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A judgment of the court under this subparagraph may be reviewed by the Supreme Court under section 1254 of title 28. Application for review by the Supreme Court must be made not later than 30 days after entry of the court's judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A decision of the Secretary of Transportation on a petition for an exemption under this paragraph may be reviewed administratively or judicially only as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Notwithstanding section 32903 of this title, during a model year when an exemption under this paragraph is effective for a manufacturer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) credit may not be earned under section 32903(a) of this title by the manufacturer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) credit may not be made available under section 32903(b)(2) of this title for the manufacturer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Testing and Calculation Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall measure fuel economy for each model and calculate average fuel economy for a manufacturer under testing and calculation procedures prescribed by the Administrator. However, except under section 32908 of this title, the Administrator shall use the same procedures for passenger automobiles the Administrator used for model year 1975 (weighted 55 percent urban cycle and 45 percent highway cycle), or procedures that give comparable results. A measurement of fuel economy or a calculation of average fuel economy (except under section 32908) shall be rounded off to the nearest .1 of a mile a gallon. The Administrator shall decide on the quantity of other fuel that is equivalent to one gallon of gasoline. To the extent practicable, fuel economy tests shall be carried out with emissions tests under section 206 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7525).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date of Procedure or Amendment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe a procedure under this section, or an amendment (except a technical or clerical amendment) in a procedure, at least 12 months before the beginning of the model year to which the procedure or amendment applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Reports and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall report measurements and calculations under this section to the Secretary of Transportation and shall consult and coordinate with the Secretary in carrying out this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Increases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) For each of the model years 1993&ndash;2004 for each category of automobile (except an electric automobile), the maximum increase in average fuel economy for a manufacturer attributable to dual fueled automobiles is 1.2 miles a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the application of section 32905(b) and (d) of this title is extended under section 32905(f) of this title, for each category of automobile (except an electric automobile) the maximum increase in average fuel economy for a manufacturer for each of the model years 2005&ndash;2008 attributable to dual fueled automobiles is .9 mile a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In applying paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall determine the increase in a manufacturer's average fuel economy attributable to dual fueled automobiles by subtracting from the manufacturer's average fuel economy calculated under section 32905(e) of this title the number equal to what the manufacturer's average fuel economy would be if it were calculated by the formula in section 32904(a)(1) of this title by including as the denominator for each model of dual fueled automobile the fuel economy when the automobiles are operated on gasoline or diesel fuel. If the increase attributable to dual fueled automobiles for any model year described&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection is more than 1.2 miles a gallon, the limitation in paragraph (1)(A) applies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection is more than .9 mile a gallon, the limitation in paragraph (1)(B) applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Offsets</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding this section and sections 32901(c) and 32905 of this title, if the Secretary of Transportation reduces the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles for any model year below 27.5 miles a gallon, an increase in average fuel economy for passenger automobiles of more than .7 mile a gallon to which a manufacturer of dual fueled automobiles would otherwise be entitled is reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the reduction in the standard. However, the increase may not be reduced to less than .7 mile a gallon.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) necessary to prevent the insolvency or bankruptcy of the manufacturer of automobiles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the manufacturer shows that the violation was caused by an act of God, a strike, or a fire; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Federal Trade Commission certifies under subsection (b)(1) of this section that a reduction in the penalty is necessary to prevent a substantial lessening of competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Certification by Commission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer liable for a civil penalty under section 32912(b) of this title may apply to the Commission for a certification that a reduction in the penalty is necessary to prevent a substantial lessening of competition in the segment of the motor vehicle industry subject to the standard that was violated. The Commission shall make the certification when it finds that reduction is necessary to prevent the lessening. The Commission shall state in the certification the maximum amount by which the penalty may be reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application under this subsection must be made not later than 30 days after the Secretary decides that the manufacturer has violated section 32911(b) of this title. To the maximum extent practicable, the Commission shall make a decision on an application by the 90th day after the application is filed. A proceeding under this subsection may not delay the manufacturer's liability for the penalty for more than 90 days after the application is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a civil penalty is collected in a civil action under this chapter before a decision of the Commission under this subsection is final, the payment shall be paid to the court in which the action was brought. The court shall deposit the payment in the general fund of the Treasury on the 90th day after the decision of the Commission becomes final.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Extension of Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than 3 years after the standard is prescribed under subsection (a) of this section and based on the finding of the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section to apply the standard, the Secretary shall apply that standard to covered major parts and major replacement parts for covered parts that manufacturers install in the lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks)&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;33104. Designation of high theft vehicle lines and parts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Designation, Nonapplication, Selection, and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For purposes of the standard under section 33102 of this title, the following are high theft lines:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a passenger motor vehicle line determined under subsection (b) of this section to have had a new passenger motor vehicle theft rate in the 2-year period covering calendar years 1990 and 1991 greater than the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts in that 2-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a passenger motor vehicle line initially introduced into commerce in the United States after December 31, 1989, that is selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as likely to have a theft rate greater than the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a passenger motor vehicle line having (for existing lines) or likely to have (for new lines) a theft rate below the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph, if the major parts in the vehicles are selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as interchangeable with the majority of the major parts that are subject to the standard and are contained in the motor vehicles of a line described in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standard may not apply to any major part of a line described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection if all the passenger motor vehicles of lines that are, or are likely to be, below the median theft rate, and that contain parts interchangeable with the major parts of the line involved, account (for existing lines), or the Secretary of Transportation determines they are likely to account (for new lines), for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all lines of that manufacturer containing those interchangeable parts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The lines, and the major parts of the passenger motor vehicles in those lines, that are to be subject to the standard may be selected by agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary. If the manufacturer and the Secretary disagree on the selection, the Secretary shall select the lines and parts, after notice to the manufacturer and opportunity for written comment, and subject to the confidentiality requirements of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall prescribe reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection is made at least 6 months before the first applicable model year beginning after the selection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A manufacturer may not be required to comply with the standard under a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection for a model year beginning earlier than 6 months after the date of the selection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A passenger motor vehicle line subject on October 25, 1992, to parts marking requirements under sections 602 and 603 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92&ndash;513, 86 Stat. 947), as added by section 101(a) of the Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;547, 98 Stat. 2756), continues to be subject to the requirements of this section and section 33102 of this title unless the line is exempted under section 33106 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determining Theft Rate for Passenger Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;new passenger motor vehicle thefts&rdquo;, when used in reference to a calendar year, means thefts in the United States in that year of passenger motor vehicles with the same model-year designation as that calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under subsection (a) of this section, the theft rate for passenger motor vehicles of a line shall be determined by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the numerator of which is the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line during the 2-year period referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the denominator of which is the sum of the respective production volumes of all passenger motor vehicles of that line (as reported to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under chapter 329 of this title) that are of model years 1990 and 1991 and are distributed for sale in commerce in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Under subsection (a) of this section, the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts during that 2-year period is the theft rate midway between the highest and the lowest theft rates determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection. If there is an even number of theft rates determined under paragraph (2), the median theft rate is the arithmetic average of the 2 adjoining theft rates midway between the highest and the lowest of those theft rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary periodically shall obtain from the most reliable source accurate and timely theft and recovery information and publish the information for review and comment. To the greatest extent possible, the Secretary shall use theft information reported by United States Government, State, and local police. After publication and opportunity for comment, the Secretary shall use the theft information to determine the median theft rate under this subsection. The Secretary and the Director shall take any necessary actions to improve the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the information, including ensuring that vehicles represented as stolen are really stolen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary periodically (but not more often than once every 2 years) may redetermine and prescribe by regulation the median theft rate under this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:607 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Providing Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary by regulation shall require each manufacturer to provide information necessary to select under subsection (a)(3) of this section the high theft lines and the major parts to be subject to the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in section 33106 of this title, the Secretary may not make the standard inapplicable to a line that has been subject to the standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this section are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to prevent or discourage the theft of motor vehicles, particularly those stolen for the removal of certain parts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to prevent or discourage the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of used parts that are removed from those vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to help reduce the cost to consumers of comprehensive insurance coverage for motor vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; includes a person (except a governmental authority) having a fleet of at least 20 motor vehicles that are used primarily for rental or lease and are not covered by a theft insurance policy issued by an insurer of passenger motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; includes a truck, a multipurpose passenger vehicle, and a motorcycle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Annual Information Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An insurer providing comprehensive coverage for motor vehicles shall provide annually to the Secretary of Transportation information on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the thefts and recoveries (in any part) of motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the number of vehicles that have been recovered intact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the rating rules and plans, such as loss information and rating characteristics, used by the insurer to establish premiums for comprehensive coverage, including the basis for the premiums, and premium penalties for motor vehicles considered by the insurer as more likely to be stolen;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the actions taken by the insurer to reduce the premiums, including changing rate levels for comprehensive coverage because of a reduction in thefts of motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the actions taken by the insurer to assist in deterring or reducing thefts of motor vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) other information the Secretary requires to carry out this chapter and to make the report and findings required by this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The information on thefts and recoveries shall include an explanation on how the information is obtained, the accuracy and timeliness of the information, and the use made of the information, including the extent and frequency of reporting the information to national, public, and private entities such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State and local police.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Reports on Reduced Claims Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An insurer shall report promptly in writing to the Secretary if the insurer, in paying a claim under an adjustment or negotiation between the insurer and the insured for a stolen motor vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reduces the payment to the insured by the amount of the value, salvage or otherwise, of a recovered part subject to a standard prescribed under section 33102 or 33103 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the reduction is not made at the express election of the insured.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>General Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall exempt from this section, for one or more years, an insurer that the Secretary decides should be exempted because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the cost of preparing and providing the information is excessive in relation to the size of the insurer's business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the information from that insurer will not contribute significantly to carrying out this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Small Insurer Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;small insurer&rdquo; means an insurer whose premiums for motor vehicle insurance issued directly or through an affiliate, including a pooling arrangement established under State law or regulation for the issuance of motor vehicle insurance, account for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) less than 10 percent of the total premiums for all forms of motor vehicle insurance issued by insurers in any State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall exempt by regulation a small insurer from this section if the Secretary finds that the exemption will not significantly affect the validity or usefulness of the information collected and compiled under this section, nationally or State-by-State. However, the Secretary may not exempt an insurer under this paragraph that is considered an insurer only because of subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations under this subsection shall provide that eligibility as a small insurer shall be based on the most recent calendar year for which adequate information is available, and that, once attained, the eligibility shall con<!-- PDFPage:613 -->tinue without further demonstration of eligibility for one or more years, as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Prescribed Form</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Information required by this section shall be provided in the form the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Periodic Compilations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to section 552 of title 5, the Secretary periodically shall compile and publish information obtained by the Secretary under this section, in a form that will be helpful to the public, the police, and Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Attorney General shall bring a civil action in a United States district court to collect a civil penalty imposed under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) bring a civil action for a temporary or permanent injunction to restrain a person violating section 33114(a)(5) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) impose and recover the penalty described in paragraph (1) of this subsection; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When practicable, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall notify a person against whom an action under this subsection is planned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall give the person an opportunity to present that person's views; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) except for a knowing and willful violation, shall give the person a reasonable opportunity to comply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The failure of the Secretary to comply with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph does not prevent a court from granting appropriate relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Jury Trial Demand</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a trial for criminal contempt for violating an injunction or restraining order issued under subsection (c) of this section, the violation of which is also a violation of this chapter, the defendant may demand a jury trial. The defendant shall be tried <!-- PDFPage:616 -->as provided in rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 App. U.S.C.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil action under subsection (a) or (c) of this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the violation occurred or the defendant resides, is found, or transacts business. Process in the action may be served in any other judicial district in which the defendant resides or is found. A subpena for a witness in the action may be served in any judicial district.</p>
