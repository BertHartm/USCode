<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Labeling Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall require that a pneumatic tire subject to a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter be labeled permanently and conspicuously with safety information the Secretary decides is necessary to carry out section 30101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents of Label</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Labeling required on a tire under subsection (a) of this section shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) identification of the manufacturer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for a retreaded tire, identification of the retreader; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for a tire containing a brand name (other than the name of the manufacturer), a code mark allowing a seller to identify the manufacturer to the purchaser;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the composition of material used in the ply of the tire;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the number of plies in the tire;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the maximum allowable load for the tire; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) a statement that the tire complies with minimum safe performance standards prescribed under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a mark or symbol the Secretary prescribes for use by a manufacturer or retreader complying with those standards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Additional Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may require that additional safety information be disclosed to a purchaser when a tire is sold.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may authorize the sale, offer for sale, introduction for sale, or delivery for introduction in interstate commerce, of a regrooved tire or a motor vehicle equipped with regrooved tires if the Secretary decides the tires are designed and made in a way consistent with section 30101 of this title. A person may not sell, offer for sale, introduce for sale, or deliver for introduction in interstate commerce, a regrooved tire or a vehicle equipped with regrooved tires unless authorized by the Secretary.</p>
