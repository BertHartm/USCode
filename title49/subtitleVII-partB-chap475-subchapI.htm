<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consulting with public agencies and planning authorities in the area surrounding the airport, United States Government officials having local responsibility for the airport, and air carriers using the airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A program submitted under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall state the measures the operator has taken or proposes to take to reduce existing noncompatible uses and prevent introducing additional noncompatible uses in the area covered by the map.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establishing a preferential runway system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) restricting the use of the airport by a type or class of aircraft because of the noise characteristics of the aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) constructing barriers and acoustical shielding and soundproofing public buildings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) using flight procedures to control the operation of aircraft to reduce exposure of individuals to noise in the area surrounding the airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) acquiring land, air rights, easements, development rights, and other interests to ensure that the property will be used in ways compatible with airport operations.</p>

The Secretary shall approve the program (except as the program is related to flight procedures referred to in subsection (a)(2)(D)) if the program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) does not place an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is reasonably consistent with achieving the goal of reducing noncompatible uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible uses; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A program (except as the program is related to flight procedures referred to in subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section) is deemed to be approved if the Secretary does not act within the 180-day period.</p>
