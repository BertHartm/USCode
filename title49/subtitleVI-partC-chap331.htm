<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than October 25, 1994, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe a vehicle theft standard that conforms to the requirements of this chapter for covered major parts that manufacturers install in passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) in not more than 50 percent of the lines not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Extension of Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than 3 years after the standard is prescribed under subsection (a) of this section and based on the finding of the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section to apply the standard, the Secretary shall apply that standard to covered major parts and major replacement parts for covered parts that manufacturers install in the lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Initial Review of Effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Secretary begins a regulatory proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall make a finding that the Secretary shall apply the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section unless the Attorney General finds, based on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title and other information the Attorney General develops after providing notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that applying the standard prescribed in subsection (a) to the remaining lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) not covered by that standard would not substantially inhibit chop shop operations and motor vehicle thefts. The Attorney General also shall consider and include in the record additional costs, effectiveness, competition, and available alternative factors. The Attorney General shall submit to the Secretary the finding and record on which the finding is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Long Range Review of Effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than December 31, 1999, the Attorney General shall make separate findings, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, on the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this subsection, or both, have been effective in substantially inhibiting the operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the anti-theft devices for which the Secretary has granted exemptions under section 33106 of this title are an effective substitute for parts marking in substantially inhibiting motor vehicle theft.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In making the finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) base that finding on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) consider the effectiveness, the extent of use, and the extent to which civil and criminal penalties under section 33115(b) of this title and section 2322 of title 18 on chop shops have been effective in substantially inhibiting operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) base that finding on the 3-year and 5-year reports issued by the Secretary under section 33113 of this title; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall submit a finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection promptly to the Secretary. If the Attorney General finds that the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or both, has not been effective, the Secretary shall issue, not later than 180 days after receiving that finding, an order terminating the standard the Attorney General found was ineffective. The termination is effective for the model year beginning after the order is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making a finding under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives. If the Attorney General finds that the anti-theft devices are an effective substitute, the Secretary shall continue to grant exemptions under section 33106 of this title for the model years after model year 2000 at one of the following levels that the Attorney General decides: at the level authorized before October 25, 1992, or at the level provided in section 33106(b)(2)(C) of this title for model year 2000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date of Standard</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard prescribed under this section takes effect at least 6 months after the date the standard is prescribed, except that the Secretary may prescribe an earlier effective date if the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publishes the reasons for the decision.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Notification of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary and the Attorney General shall inform the appropriate legislative committees of Congress with jurisdiction over this part and section 2322 of title 18 of actions taken or planned under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;33104. Designation of high theft vehicle lines and parts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Designation, Nonapplication, Selection, and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For purposes of the standard under section 33102 of this title, the following are high theft lines:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a passenger motor vehicle line determined under subsection (b) of this section to have had a new passenger motor vehicle theft rate in the 2-year period covering calendar years 1990 and 1991 greater than the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts in that 2-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a passenger motor vehicle line initially introduced into commerce in the United States after December 31, 1989, that is selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as likely to have a theft rate greater than the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a passenger motor vehicle line having (for existing lines) or likely to have (for new lines) a theft rate below the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph, if the major parts in the vehicles are selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as interchangeable with the majority of the major parts that are subject to the standard and are contained in the motor vehicles of a line described in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standard may not apply to any major part of a line described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection if all the passenger motor vehicles of lines that are, or are likely to be, below the median theft rate, and that contain parts interchangeable with the major parts of the line involved, account (for existing lines), or the Secretary of Transportation determines they are likely to account (for new lines), for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all lines of that manufacturer containing those interchangeable parts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The lines, and the major parts of the passenger motor vehicles in those lines, that are to be subject to the standard may be selected by agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary. If the manufacturer and the Secretary disagree on the selection, the Secretary shall select the lines and parts, after notice to the manufacturer and opportunity for written comment, and subject to the confidentiality requirements of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall prescribe reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection is made at least 6 months before the first applicable model year beginning after the selection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A manufacturer may not be required to comply with the standard under a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection for a model year beginning earlier than 6 months after the date of the selection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A passenger motor vehicle line subject on October 25, 1992, to parts marking requirements under sections 602 and 603 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92&ndash;513, 86 Stat. 947), as added by section 101(a) of the Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;547, 98 Stat. 2756), continues to be subject to the requirements of this section and section 33102 of this title unless the line is exempted under section 33106 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determining Theft Rate for Passenger Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;new passenger motor vehicle thefts&rdquo;, when used in reference to a calendar year, means thefts in the United States in that year of passenger motor vehicles with the same model-year designation as that calendar year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:698 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Under subsection (a) of this section, the theft rate for passenger motor vehicles of a line shall be determined by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the numerator of which is the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line during the 2-year period referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the denominator of which is the sum of the respective production volumes of all passenger motor vehicles of that line (as reported to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under chapter 329 of this title) that are of model years 1990 and 1991 and are distributed for sale in commerce in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Under subsection (a) of this section, the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts during that 2-year period is the theft rate midway between the highest and the lowest theft rates determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection. If there is an even number of theft rates determined under paragraph (2), the median theft rate is the arithmetic average of the 2 adjoining theft rates midway between the highest and the lowest of those theft rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary periodically shall obtain from the most reliable source accurate and timely theft and recovery information and publish the information for review and comment. To the greatest extent possible, the Secretary shall use theft information reported by United States Government, State, and local police. After publication and opportunity for comment, the Secretary shall use the theft information to determine the median theft rate under this subsection. The Secretary and the Director shall take any necessary actions to improve the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the information, including ensuring that vehicles represented as stolen are really stolen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary periodically (but not more often than once every 2 years) may redetermine and prescribe by regulation the median theft rate under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Providing Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary by regulation shall require each manufacturer to provide information necessary to select under subsection (a)(3) of this section the high theft lines and the major parts to be subject to the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in section 33106 of this title, the Secretary may not make the standard inapplicable to a line that has been subject to the standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;anti-theft device&rdquo; means a device to reduce or deter theft that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is in addition to the theft-deterrent devices required by motor vehicle safety standard numbered 114 in section 571.114 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the manufacturer believes will be effective in reducing or deterring theft of motor vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) does not use a signaling device reserved by State law for use on police, emergency, or official vehicles, or on schoolbuses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;standard equipment&rdquo; means equipment already installed in a motor vehicle when it is delivered from the manufacturer and not an accessory or other item that the first purchaser customarily has the option to have installed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Granting Exemptions and Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer may petition the Secretary of Transportation for an exemption from a requirement of a standard prescribed under section 33102 or 33103 of this title for a line of passenger motor vehicles equipped as standard equipment with an anti-theft device that the Secretary decides is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this section are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to prevent or discourage the theft of motor vehicles, particularly those stolen for the removal of certain parts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to prevent or discourage the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of used parts that are removed from those vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to help reduce the cost to consumers of comprehensive insurance coverage for motor vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; includes a person (except a governmental authority) having a fleet of at least 20 motor vehicles that are used primarily for rental or lease and are not covered by a theft insurance policy issued by an insurer of passenger motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; includes a truck, a multipurpose passenger vehicle, and a motorcycle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Annual Information Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An insurer providing comprehensive coverage for motor vehicles shall provide annually to the Secretary of Transportation information on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the thefts and recoveries (in any part) of motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the number of vehicles that have been recovered intact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the rating rules and plans, such as loss information and rating characteristics, used by the insurer to establish premiums for comprehensive coverage, including the basis for the premiums, and premium penalties for motor vehicles considered by the insurer as more likely to be stolen;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the actions taken by the insurer to reduce the premiums, including changing rate levels for comprehensive coverage because of a reduction in thefts of motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the actions taken by the insurer to assist in deterring or reducing thefts of motor vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) other information the Secretary requires to carry out this chapter and to make the report and findings required by this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The information on thefts and recoveries shall include an explanation on how the information is obtained, the accuracy and timeliness of the information, and the use made of the information, including the extent and frequency of reporting the information to national, public, and private entities such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State and local police.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Reports on Reduced Claims Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An insurer shall report promptly in writing to <!-- PDFPage:704 -->the Secretary if the insurer, in paying a claim under an adjustment or negotiation between the insurer and the insured for a stolen motor vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reduces the payment to the insured by the amount of the value, salvage or otherwise, of a recovered part subject to a standard prescribed under section 33102 or 33103 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the reduction is not made at the express election of the insured.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>General Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall exempt from this section, for one or more years, an insurer that the Secretary decides should be exempted because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the cost of preparing and providing the information is excessive in relation to the size of the insurer's business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the information from that insurer will not contribute significantly to carrying out this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Small Insurer Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;small insurer&rdquo; means an insurer whose premiums for motor vehicle insurance issued directly or through an affiliate, including a pooling arrangement established under State law or regulation for the issuance of motor vehicle insurance, account for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) less than 10 percent of the total premiums for all forms of motor vehicle insurance issued by insurers in any State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall exempt by regulation a small insurer from this section if the Secretary finds that the exemption will not significantly affect the validity or usefulness of the information collected and compiled under this section, nationally or State-by-State. However, the Secretary may not exempt an insurer under this paragraph that is considered an insurer only because of subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations under this subsection shall provide that eligibility as a small insurer shall be based on the most recent calendar year for which adequate information is available, and that, once attained, the eligibility shall continue without further demonstration of eligibility for one or more years, as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Prescribed Form</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Information required by this section shall be provided in the form the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Periodic Compilations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to section 552 of title 5, the Secretary periodically shall compile and publish information obtained by the Secretary under this section, in a form that will be helpful to the public, the police, and Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Penalty and Civil Actions To Collect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person that violates section 33114(a)(1)&ndash;(4) of this title is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each violation. The failure of more than one part of a single motor vehicle to conform to an applicable standard under section 33102 or 33103 of this title is only a single violation. The maximum penalty under this subsection for a related series of violations is $250,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation imposes a civil penalty under this subsection. The Secretary may compromise the amount of a penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining the amount of a civil penalty or compromise under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the size of the person's business and the gravity of the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Attorney General shall bring a civil action in a United States district court to collect a civil penalty imposed under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Government may deduct the amount of a civil penalty imposed or compromised under this subsection from amounts it owes the person liable for the penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Chop Shop Penalty and Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person that violates section 33114(a)(5) of <!-- PDFPage:707 -->this title is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of not more than $100,000 a day for each violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As appropriate and in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) bring a civil action for a temporary or permanent injunction to restrain a person violating section 33114(a)(5) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) impose and recover the penalty described in paragraph (1) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take both the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Enforce</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Attorney General may bring a civil action in a United States district court to enjoin a violation of this chapter or the sale, offer for sale, introduction or delivery for introduction in interstate commerce, or importation into the United States, of a passenger motor vehicle containing a major part, or of a major replacement part, that is subject to the standard and is determined before the sale of the vehicle or part to a first purchaser not to conform to the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When practicable, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall notify a person against whom an action under this subsection is planned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall give the person an opportunity to present that person's views; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) except for a knowing and willful violation, shall give the person a reasonable opportunity to comply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The failure of the Secretary to comply with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph does not prevent a court from granting appropriate relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Jury Trial Demand</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a trial for criminal contempt for violating an injunction or restraining order issued under subsection (c) of this section, the violation of which is also a violation of this chapter, the defendant may demand a jury trial. The defendant shall be tried as provided in rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 App. U.S.C.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil action under subsection (a) or (c) of this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the violation occurred or the defendant resides, is found, or transacts business. Process in the action may be served in any other judicial district in which the defendant resides or is found. A subpena for a witness in the action may be served in any judicial district.</p>
