<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A household goods freight forwarder, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a household goods freight forwarder, providing service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter IV of chapter 105 of this title, may not acquire control of a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of that chapter. However, this subsection does not prohibit a carrier providing transportation under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 from acquiring control of another such carrier under subchapter III of this chapter but subject to section 11321.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A director, officer, employee, or agent of a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with one of those carriers, may not, for that person's pecuniary benefit, own, lease, control, or hold stock in a household goods freight forwarder providing service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter IV of that chapter. However, this subsection does not prohibit the holding of a director's qualifying shares of stock from which no personal pecuniary benefit is derived by the holder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This subtitle does not prohibit a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with one of those carriers from controlling a household goods freight forwarder. When that control exists, a rate, classification, rule, or practice of one of those carriers may not be found to be unlawful because of the relationship.</p>
