<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Notwithstanding any provision of this section or of section 303 of this title&rdquo; in 49:302(c) are omitted as surplus because section 10521 of the revised title codifies the pertinent provisions of 49:302 and 303 or incorporates the terms of 49:303 related to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and section 10521 begins with the words &ldquo;Subject to&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;except the provisions of section 304 of this title relative to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees and safety of operation and equipment&rdquo; are omitted because, under section 6(e)(6)(C) of Public Law 89&ndash;670, those provisions were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsections (a) and (b), before each clause (1), the words &ldquo;does not have jurisdiction under this subchapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the provisions of this chapter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall not apply&rdquo; for clarity and to conform to the terms used in chapter 105 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a)(2) and (b)(2), the words &ldquo;is subject to&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be considered to be and <!-- PDFPage:203 -->shall be regulated as transportation subject to&rdquo; for clarity and to conform to the revised title.</p>
