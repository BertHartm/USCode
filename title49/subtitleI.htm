<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13330. Human Service Transportation Coordination</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13330, Feb. 24, 2004, 69 F.R. 9185, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to enhance access to transportation to improve mobility, employment opportunities, and access to community services for persons who are transportation-disadvantaged, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. This order is issued consistent with the following findings and principles:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) A strong America depends on citizens who are productive and who actively participate in the life of their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Transportation plays a critical role in providing access to employment, medical and health care, education, and other community services and amenities. The importance of this role is underscored by the variety of transportation programs that have been created in conjunction with health and human service programs, and by the significant Federal investment in accessible public transportation systems throughout the Nation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) These transportation resources, however, are often difficult for citizens to understand and access, and are more costly than necessary due to inconsistent and unnecessary Federal and State program rules and restrictions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) A broad range of Federal program funding allows for the purchase or provision of transportation services and resources for persons who are transportation-disadvantaged. Yet, in too many communities, these services and resources are fragmented, unused, or altogether unavailable.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Federally assisted community transportation services should be seamless, comprehensive, and accessible to those who rely on them for their lives and livelihoods. For persons with mobility limitations related to advanced age, persons with disabilities, and persons struggling for self-sufficiency, transportation within and between our communities should be as available and affordable as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The development, implementation, and maintenance of responsive, comprehensive, coordinated community transportation systems is essential for persons with disabilities, persons with low incomes, and older adults who rely on such transportation to fully participate in their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. (a) As used in this order, the term &ldquo;agency&rdquo; means an executive department or agency of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) For the purposes of this order, persons who are transportation-disadvantaged are persons who qualify for Federally conducted or Federally assisted transportation-related programs or services due to disability, income, or advanced age.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Establishment of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility</em>. (a) There is hereby established, within the Department of Transportation for administrative purposes, the &ldquo;Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility&rdquo; (&ldquo;Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council&rdquo; or &ldquo;Council&rdquo;). The membership of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council shall consist of:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) the Secretaries of Transportation, Health and Human Services, Education, Labor, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and the Interior, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Social Security; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) such other Federal officials as the Chairperson of the Council may designate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary's designee, shall serve as the Chairperson of the Council. The Chairperson shall convene and preside at meetings of the Council, determine its agenda, direct its work, and, as appropriate to particular subject matters, establish and direct subgroups of the Council, which shall consist exclusively of the Council's members.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) A member of the Council may designate any person who is part of the member's agency and who is an officer appointed by the President or a full-time employee serving in a position with pay equal to or greater than the minimum rate payable for GS&ndash;15 of the General Schedule to perform functions of the Council or its subgroups on the member's behalf.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Functions of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council</em>. The Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) promote interagency cooperation and the establishment of appropriate mechanisms to minimize duplication and overlap of Federal programs and services so that transportation-disadvantaged persons have access to more transportation services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) facilitate access to the most appropriate, cost-effective transportation services within existing resources;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) encourage enhanced customer access to the variety of transportation and resources available;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) formulate and implement administrative, policy, and procedural mechanisms that enhance transportation services at all levels; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) develop and implement a method for monitoring progress on achieving the goals of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Report</em>. In performing its functions, the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council shall present to me a report not later than 1 calendar year from the date of this order. The report shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Identify those Federal, State, Tribal and local laws, regulations, procedures, and actions that have proven to be most useful and appropriate in coordinating transportation services for the targeted populations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Identify substantive and procedural requirements of transportation-related Federal laws and regulations that are duplicative or restrict the laws&rsquo; and regulations&rsquo; most efficient operation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Describe the results achieved, on an agency and program basis, in: (i) simplifying access to transportation services for persons with disabilities, persons with low income, and older adults; (ii) providing the most appropriate, cost-effective transportation services within existing resources; and (iii) reducing duplication to make funds available for more services to more such persons;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:17 --><p class="note-body">(d) Provide recommendations to simplify and coordinate applicable substantive, procedural, and administrative requirements; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Provide any other recommendations that would, in the judgment of the Council, advance the principles set forth in section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>General</em>. (a) Agencies shall assist the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council and provide information to the Council consistent with applicable law as may be necessary to carry out its functions. To the extent permitted by law, and as permitted by available agency resources, the Department of Transportation shall provide funding and administrative support for the Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Internet Availability of Information</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;181, title IX, &sect;903, Apr. 5, 2000, 114 Stat. 196, provided that: &ldquo;The Administrator [of the Federal Aviation Administration] shall make available through the Internet home page of the Federal Aviation Administration the abstracts relating to all research grants and awards made with funds authorized by the amendments made by this Act [see Tables for classification]. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require or permit the release of any information prohibited by law or regulation from being released to the public.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 221 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;264 provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In many respects the Administration is a unique agency, being one of the few non-defense government agencies that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, while continuing to rely on outdated technology to carry out its responsibilities for a state-of-the-art industry.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Until January 1, 1996, users of the air transportation system paid 70 percent of the budget of the Administration, with the remaining 30 percent coming from the General Fund. The General Fund contribution over the years is one measure of the benefit received by the general public, military, and other users of Administration's services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Administration must become a more efficient, effective, and different organization to meet future challenges.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The need to balance the Federal budget means that it may become more and more difficult to obtain sufficient General Fund contributions to meet the Administration's future budget needs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Congress must keep its commitment to the users of the national air transportation system by seeking to spend all moneys collected from them each year and deposited into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Existing surpluses representing past receipts must also be spent for the purposes for which such funds were collected.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The aviation community and the employees of the Administration must come together to improve the system. The Administration must continue to recognize who its customers are and what their needs are, and to design and redesign the system to make safety improvements and increase productivity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Administration projects that commercial operations will increase by 18 percent and passenger traffic by 35 percent by the year 2002. Without effective airport expansion and system modernization, these needs cannot be met.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Absent significant and meaningful reform, future challenges and needs cannot be met.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Administration must have a new way of doing business.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) There is widespread agreement within government and the aviation industry that reform of the Administration is essential to safely and efficiently accommodate the projected growth of aviation within the next decade.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) To the extent that Congress determines that certain segments of the aviation community are not required to pay all of the costs of the government services which they require and benefits which they receive, Congress should appropriate the difference between such costs and any receipts received from such segment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Prior to the imposition of any new charges or user fees on segments of the industry, an independent review must be performed to assess the funding needs and assumptions for operations, capital spending, and airport infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) An independent, thorough, and complete study and assessment must be performed of the costs to the Administration and the costs driven by each segment of the aviation system for safety and operational services, including the use of the air traffic control system and the Nation's airports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Because the Administration is a unique Federal entity in that it is a participant in the daily operations of an industry, and because the national air transportation system faces significant problems without significant changes, the Administration has been authorized to change the Federal procurement and personnel systems to ensure that the Administration has the ability to keep pace with new technology and is able to match resources with the real personnel needs of the Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The existing budget system does not allow for long-term planning or timely acquisition of technology by the Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Without reforms in the areas of procurement, personnel, funding, and governance, the Administration will continue to experience delays and cost overruns in its major modernization programs and needed improvements in the performance of the air traffic management system will not occur.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) All reforms should be designed to help the Administration become more responsive to the needs of its customers and maintain the highest standards of safety.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 222 of title II of Pub. L. 104&ndash;264 provided that: &ldquo;The purposes of this title [see Effective Date of 1996 Amendment note set out above] are&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to permit the Administration, with Congressional review, to establish a program to improve air traffic management system performance and to establish appropriate levels of cost accountability for air traffic management services provided by the Administration;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:37 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to establish a more autonomous and accountable Administration within the Department of Transportation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to make the Administration a more efficient and effective organization, able to meet the needs of a dynamic, growing industry, and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Preservation of Existing Authority</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 223(b) of title II of Pub.

<p class="note-body">(g) establish strong incentives to managers for achieving results; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) formulate and recommend to the Administrator any management, fiscal, or legislative changes necessary for the organization to achieve its performance goals.</p>

Not later than 5 years after the date of this order, the Aviation Management Advisory Committee shall provide to the Secretary and the Administrator a report on the operation and effectiveness of the ATO, together with any recommendations for management, fiscal, or legislative changes to enable the organization to achieve its goals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Definitions</em>. The term &ldquo;air traffic control system&rdquo; has the same meaning as the term defined by section 40102(a)(42) [now 40102(a)(47)] of title 49, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Judicial Review</em>.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The current rate, number, and severity of crashes involving motor carriers in the United States are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The number of Federal and State commercial motor vehicle and operator inspections is insufficient and civil penalties for violators must be utilized to deter future violations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Department of Transportation is failing to meet statutorily mandated deadlines for completing rulemaking proceedings on motor carrier safety and, in some significant safety rulemaking proceedings, including driver hours-of-service regulations, extensive periods have elapsed without progress toward resolution or implementation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Too few motor carriers undergo compliance reviews and the Department's data bases and information systems require substantial improvement to enhance the Department's ability to target inspection and enforcement resources toward the most serious safety problems and to improve States&rsquo; ability to keep dangerous drivers off the roads.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Additional safety inspectors and inspection facilities are needed in international border areas to ensure that commercial motor vehicles, drivers, and carriers comply with United States safety standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Department should rigorously avoid conflicts of interest in federally funded research.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Meaningful measures to improve safety must be implemented expeditiously to prevent increases in motor carrier crashes, injuries, and fatalities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Proper use of Federal resources is essential to the Department's ability to improve its research, rulemaking, oversight, and enforcement activities related to commercial motor vehicles, operators, and carriers.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;333. Responsibility for rail transportation unification and coordination projects</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Transportation may develop and make available to interested persons any plans, proposals, and recommendations for mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, and other unification or coordination projects for rail transportation (including arrangements for joint use of tracks and other facilities and acquisition or sale of assets) that the Secretary believes will result in a rail system that is more efficient and consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) To achieve a more efficient, economical, and viable rail system in the private sector, the Secretary, when requested by a rail carrier and under this section, may assist in planning, negotiating, and carrying out a unification or coordination of operations and facilities of at least 2 rail carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary may conduct studies to determine the potential cost savings and possible improvements in the quality of rail transportation that are likely to result from unification or coordination of at least 2 rail carriers, through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) elimination of duplicating or overlapping operations and facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) reducing switching operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) using the shortest or more efficient and economical routes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) exchanging trackage rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) combining trackage and terminal or other facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) upgrading tracks and other facilities used by at least 2 rail carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) reducing administrative and other expenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) other measures likely to reduce costs and improve rail transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary requests information for a study under this section, a rail carrier shall provide the information requested. In carrying out this section, the Secretary may designate an officer or employee to get from a rail carrier information on the kind, quality, origin, destination, consignor, consignee, and routing of property. This information may be obtained without the consent of the consignor or consignee notwithstanding section 11904 of this title. When appropriate, the designated officer or employee has the powers described in section 203(c) of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 to carry out this section, but a subpena must be issued under the signature of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) When requested by a rail carrier, the Secretary may hold conferences on and mediate disputes resulting from a proposed unification or coordination project. The Secretary may invite to a conference&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) officers and directors of an affected rail carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) representatives of rail carrier employees who may be affected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) representatives of the Interstate Commerce Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) State and local government officials, shippers, and consumer representatives; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) representatives of the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person attending or represented at a conference on a proposed unification or coordination project is not liable under the antitrust laws of the United States for any discussion at the conference and for any agreements reached at the conference, that are entered into with the approval of the Secretary to achieve or determine a plan of action to carry out the unification or coordination project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the approval of a proposal submitted by a rail carrier for a merger or other action is subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under section 11323(a) of this title, the Secretary may study the proposal to decide whether it satisfies section 11324(b) of this title. When the proposal is the subject of an application and proceeding before the Commission, the Secretary may appear in any proceeding related to the application.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the chapter, the source provisions are those in effect on March 31, 1967, the day before the effective date of the Department of Transportation Act (Pub. L. 89&ndash;670, 80 Stat. 931), because 49:1655(f)(2) gave the Secretary of Transportation the same powers enumerated in 49:1655(f)(2) that the Interstate Commerce Commission had before certain duties and powers under 49:1655(e) were transferred on April 1, 1967, from the Commission to the Secretary. All references to brokers in the source provisions are omitted as not being applicable to the duties and powers transferred to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is included to ensure that the identical definitions that are relevant are used without repeating them. The source provisions for the definitions are found in the revision notes for sections 3101, 3102(c), and 10102 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the provisions of law to which the chapter applies are only certain laws listed in 49:1655(e). Those laws include the source provisions restated in chapter 31 of the revised title and 45:4, 5, 6 (in carrying out 45:4 and 5), 11, 12, 13 (proviso), 13 (less proviso in carrying out 45:11, 12, and 13 (proviso)), and 61&ndash;64b, and 49:26(a)&ndash;(f) (words before last semicolon) and (h). The administrative powers of the Secretary under the chapter are based on the administrative powers of 49:1655(f)(2). That provision lists administrative powers the Commission had under the Interstate Commerce Act (ch. 104, 24 Stat. 379) to carry out the Act, and certain other laws authorized the Commission to use its powers under the Act to carry out those other laws. The administrative powers listed in 49:1655(f)(2) and codified in the chapter therefore apply only to a law listed in 49:1655(e) that was a part of the Interstate Commerce Act or to which the powers of the Commission under the Act were applied. The text of 45:61&ndash;64b is included because section 4 of the Act of March 4, 1907 (ch. 2939, 34 Stat. 1417), stated, &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Interstate Commerce Commission to execute and enforce the provisions of this Act, and all powers granted to the Interstate Commerce Commission are hereby extended to it in the execution of this Act&rdquo;. The transfer to the Secretary was executed on March 31, 1967. The Act of March 4, 1907, was restated by the Act of December 26, 1969 (Pub. L. 91&ndash;169, 83 Stat. 463); section 4 was not included in the restatement. However, repeal by implication is not favored and the transfer was completed on March 31, 1967. Therefore, the text of 45:61&ndash;64b is included within the scope of the chapter. The text of 49:304(a)(3) (last sentence 1st&ndash;7th words) and (3a) (last sentence 1st&ndash;5th words) is omitted as executed.</p>

The designation shall be in writing and filed with the Secretary.

Service by mail on the designated agent is made at the address filed for the agent. When notice is given by mail, the date of mailing is considered to be the time when the notice is served. If the carrier does not have a designated agent, service may be made by posting a copy of the notice in the office of the secretary or clerk of the authority having jurisdiction to regulate transportation by motor vehicle in intrastate commerce on the highways of the State in which the carrier maintains headquarters and with the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each of those carriers, including such a carrier operating in the United States while providing transportation between places in a foreign country or between a place in one foreign country and a place in another foreign country, shall designate an agent in each State in which it operates by name and post office address on whom process issued by a court with subject matter jurisdiction may be served in an action brought against that carrier. The designation shall be in writing and filed with the Secretary and with the authority of each State in which the carrier operates having jurisdiction to regulate transportation by motor vehicle in intrastate commerce on the highways of that State.
