The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is issued. The court may allow the petition to be filed after the 60th day only if there are reasonable grounds for not filing by the 60th day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a petition is filed under subsection (a) of this section, the clerk of the court immediately shall send a copy of the petition to the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator, as appropriate. The Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator shall file with the court a record of any proceeding in which the order was issued, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Authority of Court</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the petition is sent to the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator, the court has exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, amend, modify, or set aside any part of the order and may order the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator to conduct further proceedings. After reasonable notice to the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator, the court may grant interim relief by staying the order or taking other appropriate action when good cause for its action exists. Findings of fact by the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Requirement for Prior Objection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In reviewing an order under this section, the court may consider an objection to an order of the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator only if the objection was made in the proceeding conducted by the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Administrator or if there was a reasonable ground for not making the objection in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Supreme Court Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A decision by a court under this section may be reviewed only by the Supreme Court under section 1254 of title 28.</p>
