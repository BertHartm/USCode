<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;reported to, or otherwise&rdquo; and &ldquo;or the Secretary's representative&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;related to a confidential matter referred to&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;contains or relates to a trade secret or other matter referred to&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;or in section 552(b)(4) of title 5&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because the language in 18:1905 is broader than the language in 5:552(b)(4) and for consistency with similar provisions in other chapters in this part. The words &ldquo;shall be considered confidential for the purpose of the applicable section of this subchapter&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;for use in carrying out&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;concerned with carrying out&rdquo; for consistency with similar provisions in other chapters in this <!-- PDFPage:499 -->part. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;when relevant&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The cross-reference to 15:2023(a)(3) is omitted. The text of 15:2023(a)(3), originally enacted as section 603(a)(3) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92&ndash;513, 86 Stat. 947), was repealed by section 303(2) of the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&ndash;519, 106 Stat. 3396). Section 303(2) also redesignated subsection (a)(4) as subsection (a)(3). However, a corresponding amendment to correct the cross-reference in the source provisions restated in this section was not made.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;authorized to have the information&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency with similar provisions in other chapters in this part.</p>
