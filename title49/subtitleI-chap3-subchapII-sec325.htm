<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;provisions of title 5 governing appointment in the competitive service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;civil service laws&rdquo; in 49:1657(<em>o</em>) for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;as shall be appropriate for the purpose of&rdquo; before &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; in 49:1657(<em>o</em>) are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;the Secretary in carrying out the duties and powers of the Secretary&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the Department in performance of its functions&rdquo; in 49:1657(<em>o</em>) and &ldquo;the Administration in performance of its functions hereunder&rdquo; in 49:1343(g) for clarity and consistency because the duties and powers are vested in the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; after &ldquo;may be paid&rdquo; in 49:1657(<em>o</em>) is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;not more than $100 a day&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;at rates not exceeding those authorized for individuals under subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; in 49:1657(<em>o</em>) for clarity because that is the rate under 49:1657(b). The words &ldquo;A member is entitled to reimbursement for expenses under section 5703 of title 5&rdquo; are substituted for 49:1343(g) (last sentence) and 49:1657(<em>o</em>) (last sentence words after 4th comma) for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;A member of an advisory committee advising the Secretary&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in the case of any individual&rdquo; in 49:1343(g) for clarity. The words &ldquo;may serve&rdquo; are added for clarity and because of the restatement of the section. The words &ldquo;in carrying out aviation duties and powers&rdquo; are added because the source provisions being restated only applies to carrying out duties and powers related to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
