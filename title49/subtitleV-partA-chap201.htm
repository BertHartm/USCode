<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Ordering Restrictions and Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, through testing, inspection, investigation, or research carried out under this chapter, the Secretary of Transportation decides that an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, causes an emergency situation involving a hazard of death, personal injury, or significant harm to the environment, the Secretary immediately may order restrictions and prohibitions, without regard to section 20103(e) of this title, that may be necessary to abate the situation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The order shall describe the condition or practice, or a combination of conditions and practices, that causes the emergency situation and prescribe standards and procedures for obtaining relief from the order. This paragraph does not affect the Secretary's discretion under this section to maintain the order in effect for as long as the emergency situation exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After issuing an order under this section, the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for review of the order under section 554 of title 5. If a petition for review is filed and the review is not completed by the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the order was issued, the order stops being effective at the end of that period unless the Secretary decides in writing that the emergency situation still exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Compel Issuance of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An employee of a railroad carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce who may be exposed to imminent physical injury during that employment because of the Secretary's failure, without any reasonable basis, to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section, or the employee's authorized representative, may bring a civil action against the Secretary in a district court of the United States to compel the Secretary to issue an order. The action must be brought in the judicial district in which the emergency situation is alleged to exist, in which that employing carrier has its principal executive office, or for the District of Columbia. The Secretary's failure to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section may be reviewed only under section 706 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Investigative and Surveillance Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary concerned may prescribe investigative and surveillance activities necessary to enforce the safety regulations prescribed and orders issued by the Secretary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#20105_1_target" name="20105_1">1</a></sup> that apply to railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in a State. The State may participate in those activities when the safety practices for railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in the State are regulated by a State authority and the authority submits to the Secretary concerned an annual certification as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Annual Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State authority's annual certification must include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a certification that the authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has regulatory jurisdiction over the safety practices for railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) was given a copy of each safety regulation prescribed and order issued by the Secretary concerned, that applies to the equipment, facilities, rolling stock, or operations, as of the date of certification; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the record maintenance, reporting, and inspection practices conducted by the <!-- PDFPage:406 -->authority to aid the Secretary concerned in enforcing railroad safety regulations prescribed and orders issued by the Secretary concerned, including the number of inspections made of railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations by the authority during the prior 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) other information the Secretary concerned requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annual certification applies to a safety regulation prescribed or order issued after the date of the certification only if the State authority submits an appropriate certification to provide the necessary investigative and surveillance activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, after receipt of an annual certification, the Secretary concerned decides the State authority is not complying satisfactorily with the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary concerned may reject any part of the certification or take other appropriate action to achieve adequate enforcement.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may terminate any part of an agreement made under this subsection on finding that the authority has not provided every part of the investigative and surveillance activities to which the agreement relates. The Secretary concerned must give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before making such a finding. The finding and termination shall be published in the Federal Register and may not become effective for at least 15 days after the date of publication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Agreement for Investigative and Surveillance Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to providing for State participation under this section, the Secretary concerned may make an agreement with a State to provide investigative and surveillance activities related to the duties under chapters 203&ndash;213 of this title (in the case of the Secretary of Transportation) and duties under section 114 of this title (in the case of the Secretary of Homeland Security).</p>

However, the Secretary concerned may pay an authority only when the authority assures the Secretary concerned that it will provide the remaining cost of the safety program and that the total State money expended for the safety program, excluding grants of the United States Government, will be at least as much as the average amount expended for the fiscal years that ended June 30, 1969, and June 30, 1970.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary concerned may monitor State investigative and surveillance practices and carry out other inspections and investigations necessary to help enforce this chapter (in the case of the Secretary of Transportation) and duties under section 114 of this title (in the case of the Secretary of Homeland Security).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;At the request of the Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;at the request of the Secretary&rdquo; in 45:439(a), and are made applicable to all of the source provisions restated in this subsection, for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;at the request of the Secretary&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are interpreted and restated to mean that the Secretary's request is to the Attorney General rather than to the district court. See H.R. Rept. No. 91&ndash;1194, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20 (1970). The words &ldquo;the Attorney General may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such district court shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (last sentence), &ldquo;The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(d)(2), and &ldquo;The United States district court shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon petition by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have jurisdiction&rdquo; in 45:439(a) for clarity and consistency. It is not necessary to restate that the district court has jurisdiction because of 28:1331 and 1345. See also the statement of Senator Prouty in 115 Cong. Rec. 40205 (1969) explaining that similar language in section 110 of S. 1933, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (the derivative source for 45:439) would grant the Attorney General the power to seek injunctions. Clauses (1)&ndash;(3) are substituted for the source provisions to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of rules 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are omitted as surplus because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.) apply in the district court unless otherwise provided. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;or an amount agreed on in compromise&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the text of 45:439(c) (words before 1st comma) is omitted because it applies only to actions brought by a State authority. See discussion of the cross-reference in the note for section 20113(c) of the revised title. The last sentence is substituted for &ldquo;in which the individual resides&rdquo; in 45:438(c) because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;compliance order issued under section 20111(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;order, or directive&rdquo; because the latter words are interpreted as referring to &ldquo;orders directing compliance&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (2d sentence), restated in section 20111(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>

The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which employees shall be required to participate in a program. Each railroad carrier is encouraged to make such a program available to all of its employees in addition to employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Interim Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than December 31, 1992, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe temporary regulations identifying ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights as temporary locomotive visibility measures and authorizing and encouraging the installation and use of those lights. Subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 does not apply to a temporary regulation or to an amendment to a temporary regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Review of Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review the Secretary's regulations on locomotive visibility. Not later than December 31, 1993, the Secretary shall complete the current research of the Department of Transportation on locomotive visibility. In conducting the review, the Secretary shall collect relevant information from operational experience by rail carriers using enhanced visibility measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Regulatory Proceeding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than June 30, 1994, the Secretary shall begin a regulatory proceeding to prescribe final regulations requiring substantially enhanced locomotive visibility measures. In the proceeding, the Secretary shall consider at least&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) revisions to the existing locomotive headlight standards, including standards for placement and intensity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring the use of reflective material to enhance locomotive visibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requiring the use of additional alerting lights, including ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) requiring the use of auxiliary lights to enhance locomotive visibility when viewed from the side;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the effect of an enhanced visibility measure on the vision, health, and safety of train crew members; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) separate standards for self-propelled, push-pull, and multi-unit passenger operations without a dedicated head end locomotive.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Final Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than June 30, 1995, the Secretary shall prescribe final regulations requiring enhanced locomotive visibility measures. The Secretary shall require that not later than December 31, 1997, a locomotive not excluded from the regulations be equipped with temporary visibility measures under subsection (b) of this section or the visibility measures the final regulations require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may exclude a category of trains or rail operations from a specific visibility requirement if the Secretary decides the exclusion is in the public interest and is consistent with rail safety, including grade-crossing safety.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;highway-rail grade crossing&rdquo; includes any street or highway crossing over a line of railroad at grade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;locomotive horn&rdquo; refers to a train-borne audible warning device meeting standards specified by the Secretary of Transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;supplementary safety measure&rdquo; refers to a safety system or procedure, provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the highway-rail grade crossing, that is determined by the Secretary to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties. A traffic control arrangement that prevents careless movement over the crossing (e.g., as where adequate median barriers prevent movement around crossing gates extending over the full width of the lanes in the particular direction of travel), and that conforms to standards prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection, shall be deemed to constitute a supplementary safety measure. The following do not, individually or in combination, constitute supplementary safety measures within the meaning of this subsection: standard traffic control devices or arrangements such as reflectorized crossbucks, stop signs, flashing lights, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of railroad, or traffic signals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations requiring that a locomotive horn shall be sounded while each train is approaching and entering upon each public highway-rail grade crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In issuing such regulations, the Secretary may except from the requirement to sound the locomotive horn any categories of rail operations or categories of highway-rail grade crossings (by train speed or other factors specified by regulation)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the Secretary determines not to present a significant risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for which use of the locomotive horn as a warning measure is impractical; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:429 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for which, in the judgment of the Secretary, supplementary safety measures fully compensate for the absence of the warning provided by the locomotive horn.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to provide for safety and the quiet of communities affected by train operations, the Secretary may specify in such regulations that any supplementary safety measures must be applied to all highway-rail grade crossings within a specified distance along the railroad in order to be excepted from the requirement of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application for Waiver or Exemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may not entertain an application for waiver or exemption of the regulations issued under this section unless such application shall have been submitted jointly by the railroad carrier owning, or controlling operations over, the crossing and by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority. The Secretary shall not grant any such application unless, in the judgment of the Secretary, the application demonstrates that the safety of highway users will not be diminished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Development of Supplementary Safety Measures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In order to promote the quiet of communities affected by rail operations and the development of innovative safety measures at highway-rail grade crossings, the Secretary may, in connection with demonstration of proposed new supplementary safety measures, order railroad carriers operating over one or more crossings to cease temporarily the sounding of locomotive horns at such crossings.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;20161. Fostering introduction of new technology to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Collisions between highway users and trains at highway-rail grade crossings continue to cause an unacceptable loss of life, serious personal injury, and property damage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) While elimination of at-grade crossings through consolidation of crossings and grade separations offers the greatest long-term promise for optimizing the safety and efficiency of the two modes of transportation, over 140,000 public grade crossings remain on the general rail system&mdash;approximately one for each route mile on the general rail system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Conventional highway traffic control devices such as flashing lights and gates are often effective in warning motorists of a train's approach to an equipped crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Since enactment of the Highway Safety Act of 1973, over $4,200,000,000 of Federal funding has been invested in safety improvements at highway-rail grade crossings, yet a majority of public highway-rail grade crossings are not yet equipped with active warning systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The emergence of new technologies presents opportunities for more effective and affordable warnings and safer passage of highway users and trains at remaining highway-rail grade crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Implementation of new crossing safety technology will require extensive cooperation between highway authorities and railroad carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal Railroad Administration regulations establishing performance standards for processor-based signal and train control systems provide a suitable framework for qualification of new or novel technology at highway-rail grade crossings, and the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides an appropriate means of determining highway user interface with such new technology.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States to encourage the development of new technology that can prevent loss of life and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary of Transportation is designated to carry out this policy in consultation with States and necessary public and private entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Submission of New Technology Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Railroad carriers and railroad suppliers may submit for review and approval to the Secretary such new technology designed to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary shall approve by order the new technology designed to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings in accordance with Federal Railroad Administration standards for the development and use of processor-based signal and train control systems and shall consider the effects on safety of highway-user interface with the new technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Secretarial Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary approves by order new technology to provide warning to highway users at a highway-rail grade crossing and such technology is installed at a highway-rail grade crossing in accordance with the conditions of the approval, this determination preempts any State statute or regulation concerning the adequacy of the technology in providing warning at the crossing.</p>
