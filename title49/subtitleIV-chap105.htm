<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) only by railroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by railroad and water, when the transportation is under common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by pipeline or by pipeline and railroad or water when transporting a commodity other than water, gas, or oil; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent such jurisdiction is not limited by subsection (b) of this section or the extent the transportation is in the United States and is between a place in&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the District of Columbia and another place in the District of Columbia;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a State and a place in a territory or possession of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a territory or possession of the United States and a place in another such territory or possession;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a territory or possession of the United States and another place in the same territory or possession;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the United States and another place in the United States through a foreign country; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the United States and a place in a foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission does not have jurisdiction under subsection (a) of this section over&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the transportation of passengers or property, or the receipt, delivery, storage, or handling of property, entirely in a State (other than the District of Columbia) and not transported between a place in the United States and a place in a foreign country except as otherwise provided in this subtitle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) transportation by a water common carrier when that transportation would be subject to this subchapter only because the water common carrier absorbs, out of its port-to-port water rates or out of its proportional through rates, a switching, terminal, lighterage, car rental, trackage, handling, or other charge by a rail carrier for services in the switching, drayage, lighterage, or corporate limits of a port terminal or district.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This subtitle does not affect the power of a State, in exercising its police power, to require reasonable intrastate transportation by carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter unless (1) the transportation is deemed to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission pursuant to section 11501(b)(4)(B) of this title, or (2) the State requirement is inconsistent with an order of the Commission issued under this subtitle or is prohibited under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The jurisdiction of the Commission and of State authorities (to the extent such authorities are authorized to administer the standards and procedures of this subtitle pursuant to this sec<!-- PDFPage:197 -->tion and section 11501(b) of this title) over transportation by rail carriers, and the remedies provided in this subtitle with respect to the rates, classifications, rules, and practices of such carriers, is exclusive.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Subject to this chapter and other provisions of law&rdquo; are inserted to inform the reader that other sections of the chapter and subtitle qualify the grant of jurisdiction to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the section. The words &ldquo;the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The provisions of this chapter shall apply to&rdquo; in 49:1(1) and (2) to eliminate surplus language and for clarity because the intent of the words is to grant the Commission jurisdiction. The words &ldquo;over transportation&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;to common carriers engaged in&rdquo; in 49:1(1) and &ldquo;to such transportation of passengers and property&rdquo; in 49:1(2) to eliminate redundancy and for consistency with the other general jurisdictional statements at the beginning of each of the subchapters of chapter 105 of the revised title, giving the Commission jurisdiction over transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;rail carrier, express carrier, sleeping car carrier, water common carrier, and pipeline carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;common carriers&rdquo; for clarity and because a definition of &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; has been adopted for the subtitle that is broader and includes common carriers other than those to which 49:1(1) and (2) apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(A), the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;wholly&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(B), the word &ldquo;partly&rdquo; is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(C), the words &ldquo;natural or artificial&rdquo; in 49:1(1)(b), before &ldquo;gas&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;and&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;except water and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gas&rdquo; in 49:1(1)(b), for clarification because the exemption does not require the pipeline transportation of both water and gas before the exception applies. The exclusion of pipeline transportation of oil from the jurisdiction of the Commission is inserted in view of section 306 of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&ndash;91), transferring the functions of the Commission related to transporting oil by pipeline to the Department of Energy. The conferees of the 2 Houses explain in their joint statement that the transfer is intended to include &ldquo;pipeline transportation of crude and refined petroleum and petroleum byproducts, derivatives or petrochemicals.&rdquo; See House Report 95&ndash;539, page 69.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words &ldquo;District of Columbia&rdquo; are omitted in view of the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;a State (other than the District of Columbia)&rdquo; are inserted to exclude the District of Columbia from the jurisdictional exemption in view of 49:1(2) that does not now exempt the District of Columbia but would become exempt, but for the exclusion, as the result of the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; adopted for the revised title. The words &ldquo;except as otherwise provided in this subtitle&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;passengers or property&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; that applies to the subtitle.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;does not affect&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;nothing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall impair or affect&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate redundancy. The word &ldquo;power&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;right&rdquo; for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;freight and passenger service&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;unless&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;except insofar&rdquo; and &ldquo;except&rdquo; for clarity. The word &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;just and&rdquo; are omitted for consistency with other provisions of the revised title. See the revision note to section 10101 of the revised title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a rail carrier and a water common carrier may or do provide jointly, transportation, not entirely in one State from a place in the United States to another place in the United States, even if part of the transportation is outside the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission has the following jurisdiction over that transportation:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To establish a physical connection between the railroad lines of the rail carrier and the dock at which an interchange is to be made, the Commission may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require the rail carrier to make a suitable connection between its lines and tracks that have been constructed from the dock to the limits of the railroad right-of-way;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subject to the same restrictions on findings of public convenience and necessity and other matters that are imposed on construction under sections 10901, 10902, and 10907 of this title, require the rail carrier or water common carrier, or both, to construct to the dock at least one track connecting with the lines of the rail carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) determine and prescribe the conditions under which a connecting track is to be operated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the construction or operation of the track, determine the sum to be paid to, or by, either carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commission may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prescribe proportional rates, maximum proportional rates, minimum proportional rates, or maximum and minimum proportional rates, of a rail carrier to and from the ports to which the passengers or property is transported by the water common carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determine the passengers, property, vessels, and on which conditions those rates apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In this paragraph, &ldquo;proportional rates&rdquo; means those rates that differ from the corresponding local rates to and from a port and apply only to passengers or property brought to the port or carried from the port by a water common carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may act under this section only after a full hearing. An order entered as the result of an action may be conditioned on giving security for the payment of an amount of money or the discharge of an obligation that is required to be paid or discharged under that order.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10525. Exempt motor carrier transportation entirely in one State</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall exempt transportation of a motor carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter from compliance with this subtitle when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the motor carrier provides transportation entirely in one State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Commission finds that the nature or quantity of transportation provided by the motor carrier does not substantially affect or impair uniform regulation by the Commission of motor carrier transportation in carrying out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application of a motor carrier, a State authority having jurisdiction to regulate intrastate transportation by motor vehicle on the highways of that State, or an interested party. An application must be under oath and must contain information required by Commission regulation. The Commission may exempt the transportation by motor carrier or class of motor carriers. When an exemption is granted, the Commission shall issue a certificate of exemption describing the conditions required by the public interest under which the certificate is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When an application for exemption is accompanied by a certificate of the authority of the State in which the applicant provides transportation stating the finding of the State authority that the applicant is entitled to a certificate of exemption under this section, the exemption is effective on the 60th day after the application is filed with the Commission unless the Commission denies the application before that date. If not denied before that date, the exemption remains effective until the Commission thereafter denies or revokes it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may revoke any part of an exemption granted under this section when it finds that the nature or quantity of the transportation by the motor carrier or class of motor carriers affects or impairs, or is likely substantially to affect or impair uniform regulation by the Commission of motor carrier transportation in carrying out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. If the exemption is revoked, the Commission shall restore without further proceedings the authority any such motor carrier had to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter at the time the exemption was effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commission has no jurisdiction under this subchapter over transportation, except transportation of household goods, by a motor carrier operating solely within the State of Hawaii. The State of Hawaii may regulate transportation exempt from the jurisdiction of the <!-- PDFPage:204 -->Commission under this subsection and, to the extent provided by a motor carrier operating solely within the State of Hawaii, transportation exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission under section 10523 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) State regulation of the operations of a motor carrier covered by an exemption under this section is not a burden on interstate or foreign commerce.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction over transportation insofar as water carriers are concerned&rdquo; are based on 49:chapter 12 and are inserted to inform the reader of the general jurisdiction of the Commission in the water carrier area and to conform to the approach of sections 10501 and 10521 that are based on existing law. The words &ldquo;Subject to this chapter and other provisions of law&rdquo; are inserted to inform the reader that other sections of the subtitle qualify the grant of jurisdiction to the Commission under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), (3), the words &ldquo;wholly&rdquo;, and &ldquo;partly&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;water carrier&rdquo;, &ldquo;rail carrier&rdquo;, and &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;water&rdquo;, &ldquo;railroad&rdquo;, and &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo;, respectively, as more precise because the purpose of the language of the section is to state the jurisdiction of the Commission over transportation by the 3 types of carriers, and the terms &ldquo;railroad&rdquo; and &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; are defined terms incorporated into the definitions of &ldquo;rail carrier&rdquo; and &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo;, respectively.</p>

The word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;intrastate transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;intrastate commerce&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;within the jurisdiction of such State&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rate, fare, or charge&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;rate&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title. The words after &ldquo;intrastate transportation&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because services are included in the word &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; and because of the restatement of the source provisions.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10544. Miscellaneous water carrier transportation exemptions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except to the extent the Interstate Commerce Commission finds it necessary to exercise jurisdiction to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title, the Commission does not have jurisdiction under this subchapter over transportation by water carrier when the transportation is provided&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) entirely in one harbor or between places in contiguous harbors, other than transportation under common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment to or from a place outside the limits of the harbor or the contiguous harbors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by a vessel of not more than 100 tons carrying capacity or 100 indicated horsepower;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by a vessel carrying only passengers and equipped to carry not more than 16 passengers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) by a ferry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) by a water carrier transporting equipment of contractors used, or to be used, in construction or repair for the water carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to carry out salvage operations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may exempt from its jurisdiction under this subchapter the transportation of passengers between places in the United States through a foreign port when the Commission finds its jurisdiction is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on its own initiative or on application of an interested party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall exempt from its jurisdiction under this subchapter the transportation of commodities by water contract carrier when the Commission finds that the transportation is not actually and substantially competitive with transportation provided by a carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or II of this chapter because of the inherent nature of the commodities transported, their requirement of special equipment, or their shipment in bulk. The Commission may prescribe conditions applicable to an exemption under this subsection. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a water contract carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission does not have jurisdiction under this subtitle over transportation by a water common carrier provided between the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia, and Alaska if, before January 3, 1959&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier provided that transportation, was also a motor common carrier, and has continued to provide the transportation since before that date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the transportation was subject to the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 801 et seq.) or the Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933 (46 App. U.S.C. 843 et seq.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The transportation remains subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall exempt the transportation of property on a vessel furnished by a water contract carrier to a person not a carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subtitle when the person uses the vessel to transport its own property and the Commission finds its jurisdiction is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application of an interested party. The Commission may exempt the transportation by person or class of persons. The Commission shall specify the period of time during which the exemption is effective. The Commission may revoke the exemption when it finds that its jurisdiction over the transportation of the property is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101. The Commission may deny or revoke an exemption only after an opportunity for a proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Commission shall exempt the transportation of property by a water carrier under this subchapter when the Commission finds that the carrier is transporting only the property of a person owning substantially all of the voting stock of the carrier. When an exemption is granted, the Commission shall issue a certificate of exemption. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on its own initiative or on application of an interested party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may revoke an exemption granted under this subsection when it finds the water carrier is no longer entitled to the exemption. If the exemption is revoked, the Commission shall restore without further proceedings the authority the water carrier had to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter at the time the exemption became effective.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction over service that a freight forwarder&rdquo; are based on 49:chapter 13 and the words preceding &ldquo;undertakes&rdquo; in 49:1002(a)(7). They are inserted to inform the reader of the general jurisdiction of the Commission in the freight forwarder area and to conform to the approach of sections 10501 and 10521 that are based on existing law. The words &ldquo;Subject to this chapter and other provisions of law&rdquo; are inserted to inform the reader that other sections of the subtitle qualify the grant of jurisdiction of the Commission under section 10561. The words &ldquo;or all&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;freight forwarder&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any person .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a freight forwarder&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy and because the definition of &ldquo;freight forwarder&rdquo; applies to a person.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1) and (2), the words &ldquo;perform or&rdquo; are omitted as redundant.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;air carrier subject to chapter 20 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;air carrier subject to the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended&rdquo; because the 1938 Act was repealed and replaced by the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, and the 1958 act is included in the United States Code as chapter 20 of title 49.</p>
