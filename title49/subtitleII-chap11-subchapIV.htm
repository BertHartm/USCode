A separate violation occurs for each day a violation continues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not apply to a member of the armed forces of the United States or an employee of the Department of Defense subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice when the member or employee is performing official duties.

The text of 49 App.:1473(b)(1) (1st sentence words after 1st comma and last sentence) is omitted as unnecessary because penalties imposed by the National Transportation Safety Board do not involve liens on aircraft.
