The words &ldquo;may extend the period to a date that is not later than 18 months after the regulations are prescribed and the orders are issued&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may extend the deadline for compliance with such requirement, but in no event shall such deadline be extended past 18 months after such rules, regulations, orders, and standards are issued&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
