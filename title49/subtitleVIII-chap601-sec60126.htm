<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Risk Management Program Demonstration Projects.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish risk management demonstration projects&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to demonstrate, through the voluntary participation by owners and operators of gas pipeline facilities and hazardous liquid pipe<!-- PDFPage:1183 -->line facilities, the application of risk management; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to evaluate the safety and cost-effectiveness of the program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out a demonstration project under this subsection, the Secretary, by order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may exempt an owner or operator of the pipeline facility covered under the project (referred to in this subsection as a &ldquo;covered pipeline facility&rdquo;), from the applicability of all or a portion of the requirements under this chapter that would otherwise apply to the covered pipeline facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall exempt, for the period of the project, an owner or operator of the covered pipeline facility, from the applicability of any new standard that the Secretary promulgates under this chapter during the period of that participation, with respect to the covered facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out a demonstration project under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) invite owners and operators of pipeline facilities to submit risk management plans for timely approval by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) require, as a condition of approval, that a risk management plan submitted under this subsection contain measures that are designed to achieve an equivalent or greater overall level of safety than would otherwise be achieved through compliance with the standards contained in this chapter or promulgated by the Secretary under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) collaborative government and industry training;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) methods to measure the safety performance of risk management plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the development and application of new technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the promotion of community awareness concerning how the overall level of safety will be maintained or enhanced by the demonstration project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the development of models that categorize the risks inherent to each covered pipeline facility, taking into consideration the location, volume, pressure, and material transported or stored by that pipeline facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the application of risk assessment and risk management methodologies that are suitable to the inherent risks that are determined to exist through the use of models developed under subparagraph (E);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the development of project elements that are necessary to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the owners and operators that participate in the demonstration project demonstrate that they are effectively managing the risks referred to in subparagraph (E); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the risk management plans carried out under the demonstration project under this subsection can be audited;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) a process whereby an owner or operator of a pipeline facility is able to terminate a risk management plan or, with the approval of the Secretary, to amend, modify, or otherwise adjust a risk management plan referred to in paragraph (1) that has been approved by the Secretary pursuant to that paragraph to respond to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) changed circumstances; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a determination by the Secretary that the owner or operator is not achieving an overall level of safety that is at least equivalent to the level that would otherwise be achieved through compliance with the standards contained in this chapter or promulgated by the Secretary under this chapter;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) such other elements as the Secretary, with the agreement of the owners and operators that participate in the demonstration project under this section, determines to further the purposes of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) an opportunity for public comment in the approval process; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in selecting participants for the demonstration project, take into consideration the past safety and regulatory performance of each applicant who submits a risk management plan pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Emergencies and Revocations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section diminishes or modifies the Secretary's authority under this title to act in case of an emergency.
