<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Non-Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 18 months before the beginning of each model year, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by regulation average fuel economy standards for automobiles (except passenger automobiles) manufactured by a manufacturer in that model year. Each standard shall be the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretary decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year. The Secretary may prescribe separate standards for different classes of automobiles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a model year after model year 1984 shall be 27.5 miles a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Amending Passenger Automobile Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending the standard under subsection (b) of this section for a model year to a level that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for that model year. Section 553 of title 5 applies to a proceeding to amend the standard. However, any interested person may make an oral presentation and a transcript shall be taken of that presentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an amendment increases the standard above 27.5 miles a gallon or decreases the standard below 26.0 miles a gallon, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit the amendment to Congress. The procedures of section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6421) apply to an amendment, except that the 15 calendar days referred to in section 551(c) and (d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(c), (d)) are deemed to be 60 calendar days, and the 5 calendar days referred to in section 551(f)(4)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(f)(4)(A)) are deemed to be 20 calendar days. If either House of Congress disapproves the amendment under those procedures, the amendment does not take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, on application of a manufacturer that manufactured (whether in the United States or not) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the model year 2 years before the model year for which the application is made, the Secretary of Transportation may exempt by regulation the manufacturer from a standard under subsection (b) or (c) of this section. An exemption for a model year applies only if the manufacturer manufactures (whether in the United States or not) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the model year. The Secretary may exempt a manufacturer only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) finds that the applicable standard under those subsections is more stringent than the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the manufacturer can achieve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prescribes by regulation an alternative average fuel economy standard for the passenger automobiles manufactured by the exempted manufacturer that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for the manufacturers to which the alternative standard applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alternative average fuel economy standard the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection may apply to an individually exempted manufacturer, to all automobiles to which this subsection applies, or to classes of passenger automobiles, as defined under regulations of the Secretary, manufactured by exempted manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, an importer registered under section 30141(c) of this title may not be exempted as a manufacturer under paragraph (1) for a motor vehicle that the importer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) imports; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) brings into compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under chapter 301 of this title for an individual under section 30142 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe the contents of an application for an exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;emergency vehicle&rdquo; means an automobile manufactured primarily for use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as an ambulance or combination ambulance-hearse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by the United States Government or a State or local government for law enforcement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for other emergency uses prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:530 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) A manufacturer may elect to have the fuel economy of an emergency vehicle excluded in applying a fuel economy standard under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section. The election is made by providing written notice to the Secretary of Transportation and to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Considerations on Decisions on Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When deciding maximum feasible average fuel economy under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to conserve energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Requirements for Other Amendments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending an average fuel economy standard prescribed under subsection (a) or (d) of this section if the amended standard meets the requirements of subsection (a) or (d), as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary of Transportation prescribes an amendment under this section that makes an average fuel economy standard more stringent, the Secretary shall prescribe the amendment (and submit the amendment to Congress when required under subsection (c)(2) of this section) at least 18 months before the beginning of the model year to which the amendment applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsections (c), (f), and (g) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not consider the fuel economy of dedicated automobiles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall consider dual fueled automobiles to be operated only on gasoline or diesel fuel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in carrying out this section and section 32903 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Secretary of Energy Comments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Before issuing a notice proposing to prescribe or amend an average fuel economy standard under subsection (a), (c), or (g) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall give the Secretary of Energy at least 10 days from the receipt of the notice during which the Secretary of Energy may, if the Secretary of Energy concludes that the proposed standard would adversely affect the conservation goals of the Secretary of Energy, provide written comments to the Secretary of Transportation about the impact of the standard on those goals. To the extent the Secretary of Transportation does not revise a proposed standard to take into account comments of the Secretary of Energy on any adverse impact of the standard, the Secretary of Transportation shall include those comments in the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before taking final action on a standard or an exemption from a standard under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the Secretary of Energy and provide the Secretary of Energy a reasonable time to comment.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Earning and Period for Applying Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the average fuel economy of passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a particular model year exceeds an applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title (determined by the Secretary of Transportation without regard to credits under this section), the manufacturer earns credits. The credits may be applied to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any of the 3 consecutive model years immediately before the model year for which the credits are earned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent not used under clause (1) of this subsection, any of the 3 consecutive model years immediately after the model year for which the credits are earned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Period of Availability and Plan for Future Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, credits under this section are available to a manufacturer at the end of the model year in which earned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Before the end of a model year, if a manufacturer has reason to believe that its average fuel economy for passenger automobiles will be less than the applicable standard for that model year, the manufacturer may submit a plan to the Secretary of Transportation demonstrating that the manufacturer will earn sufficient credits under this section within the next 3 model years to allow the manufacturer to meet that standard for the model year involved. Unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer is unlikely to earn sufficient credits under the plan, the Secretary shall approve the plan. Those credits are available for the model year involved if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary approves the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the manufacturer earns those credits as provided by the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer is less than the applicable standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title after applying credits under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the manufacturer and give the manufacturer a reasonable time (of at least 60 days) to submit a plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determining Number of Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The number of credits a manufacturer earns under this section equals the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of tenths of a mile a gallon by which the average fuel economy of the passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer in the model year in which the credits are earned exceeds the applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title; times</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the number of passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer during that model year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Applying Credits for Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall apply credits to a model year on the basis of the number of tenths of a mile a gallon by which the manufacturer involved was below the applicable average fuel economy standard for that model year and the number of passenger automobiles manufactured that model year by the manufacturer. Credits applied to a model year are no longer available for another model year. Before applying credits, the Secretary shall give the manufacturer written notice and reasonable opportunity to comment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applying Credits for Non-Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Credits for a manufacturer of automobiles that are not passenger automobiles are earned and applied to a model year in which the average fuel economy of that class of automobiles is below the applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(a) of this title, to the same extent and in the same way as provided in this section for passenger automobiles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Refund of Collected Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a civil penalty has been collected under this chapter from a manufacturer that has earned credits under this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall refund to the manufacturer the amount of the penalty to the extent the penalty is attributable to credits available under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the application of section 32905(b) and (d) of this title is extended under section 32905(f) of this title, for each category of automobile (except an electric automobile) the maximum increase in average fuel economy for a manufacturer for each of the model years 2005&ndash;2008 attributable to dual fueled automobiles is .9 mile a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In applying paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall determine the increase in a manufacturer's average fuel economy attributable to dual fueled automobiles by subtracting from the manufacturer's average fuel economy calculated under section 32905(e) of this title the number equal to what the manufacturer's average fuel economy would be if it were calculated by the formula in section 32904(a)(1) of this title by including as the denominator for each model of dual fueled automobile the fuel economy when the automobiles are operated on gasoline or diesel fuel. If the increase attributable to dual fueled automobiles for any model year described&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection is more than 1.2 miles a gallon, the limitation in paragraph (1)(A) applies; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;retrofit device&rdquo; means any component, equipment, or other device&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that is designed to be installed in or on an automobile (as an addition to, as a replacement for, or through alteration or modification of, any original component, equipment, or other device); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that any manufacturer, dealer, or distributor of the device represents will provide higher fuel economy than would have resulted with the automobile as originally equipped,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">as determined under regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term also includes a fuel additive for use in an automobile.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Examination of Fuel Economy Representations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Trade Commission shall establish a program for systematically examining fuel economy representations made with respect to retrofit devices. Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any representation may be inaccurate, the Commission shall request the Administrator to evaluate, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the retrofit device with respect to which the representation was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Evaluation of Retrofit Devices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On application of any manufacturer of a retrofit device (or prototype of a retrofit device), on request of the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, or on the motion of the Administrator, the Administrator shall evaluate, in accordance with regulations prescribed under subsection (e) of this section, any retrofit device to determine whether the retrofit device increases fuel economy and to determine whether the representations, if any, made with respect to the retrofit device are accurate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator tests, or causes to be tested, any retrofit device on the application of a manufacturer of the device, the manufacturer shall supply, at the manufacturer's expense, one or more samples of the device to the Administrator <!-- PDFPage:547 -->and shall be liable for the costs of testing incurred by the Administrator. The procedures for testing retrofit devices so supplied may include a requirement for preliminary testing by a qualified independent testing laboratory, at the expense of the manufacturer of the device.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Results of Tests and Publication in Federal Register</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a summary of the results of all tests conducted under this section, together with the Administrator's conclusions as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of any retrofit device on fuel economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect of the device on emissions of air pollutants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any other information the Administrator determines to be relevant in evaluating the device.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The summary and conclusions shall also be submitted to the Secretary of Transportation and the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Regulations Establishing Tests and Procedures for Evaluation of Retrofit Devices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe regulations establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) testing and other procedures for evaluating the extent to which retrofit devices affect fuel economy and emissions of air pollutants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) criteria for evaluating the accuracy of fuel economy representations made with respect to retrofit devices.</p>
