<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 26, 2009, 74 F.R. 4907, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation [and] the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</p>
<p class="note-body">In 2007, the Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA). This law mandates that, as part of the Nation's efforts to achieve energy independence, the Secretary of Transportation prescribe annual fuel economy increases for automobiles, beginning with model year 2011, resulting in a combined fuel economy fleet average of at least 35 miles per gallon by model year 2020. On May 2, 2008, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled <em>Average Fuel Economy Standards, Passenger Cars and Light Trucks; Model Years 2011&ndash;2015, 73 Fed. Reg.</em> 24352. In the notice and comment period, the NHTSA received numerous comments, some of them contending that certain aspects of the proposed rule, including appendices providing for preemption of State laws, were inconsistent with provisions of EISA and the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency</em>, 549 U.S. 497 (2007).</p>
<p class="note-body">Federal law requires that the final rule regarding fuel economy standards be adopted at least 18 months before the beginning of the model year (49 U.S.C. 32902(g)(2)). In order for the model year 2011 standards to meet this requirement, the NHTSA must publish the final rule in the Federal Register by March 30, 2009. To date, the NHTSA has not published a final rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, I request that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) in order to comply with the EISA requirement that fuel economy increases begin with model year 2011, you take all measures consistent with law, and in coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency, to publish in the Federal Register by March 30, 2009, a final rule prescribing increased fuel economy for model year 2011;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) before promulgating a final rule concerning model years after model year 2011, you consider the appropriate legal factors under the EISA, the comments filed in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the relevant technological and scientific considerations, and to the extent feasible, the forthcoming report by the National Academy of Sciences mandated under section 107 of EISA; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) in adopting the final rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, you consider whether any provisions regarding preemption are consistent with the EISA, the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Massachusetts v. EPA</em> and other relevant provisions of law and the policies underlying them.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Secretary of Transportation is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 21, 2010, 75 F.R. 29399, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Energy[,] the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency[, and] the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</p>
<p class="note-body">America has the opportunity to lead the world in the development of a new generation of clean cars and trucks through innovative technologies and manufacturing that will spur economic growth and create high-quality domestic jobs, enhance our energy security, and improve our environment. We already have made significant strides toward reducing greenhouse gas pollution and enhancing fuel efficiency from motor vehicles with the joint rulemaking issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on April 1, 2010, which regulates these attributes of passenger cars and light-duty trucks for model years 2012&ndash;2016. In this memorandum, I request that additional coordinated steps be taken to produce a new generation of clean vehicles.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Medium- and Heavy-Duty Trucks.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">While the Federal Government and many States have now created a harmonized framework for addressing the fuel economy of and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light-duty trucks, medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses continue to be a major source of fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas pollution. I therefore request that the Administrators of the EPA and the NHTSA immediately begin work on a joint rulemaking under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) to establish fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards for commercial medium- and heavy-duty vehicles beginning with model year 2014, with the aim of issuing a final rule by July 30, 2011. As part of this rule development process, I request that the Administrators of the EPA and the NHTSA:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Propose and take comment on strategies, including those designed to increase the use of existing technologies, to achieve substantial annual progress in reducing transportation sector emissions and fossil fuel consumption consistent with my Administration's overall energy and climate security goals. These strategies should consider whether particular segments of the diverse heavy-duty vehicle sector present special opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel economy. For example, preliminary estimates indicate that large tractor trailers, representing half of all greenhouse gas emissions from this sector, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 20 percent and increase their fuel efficiency by as much as 25 percent with the use of existing technologies;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Include fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards that take into account the market structure of the trucking industry and the unique demands of heavy-duty vehicle applications; seek harmonization with applicable State standards; consider the findings and recommendations published in the National Academy of Science report on medium- and heavy-duty truck regulation; strengthen the industry and enhance job creation in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Seek input from all stakeholders, while recognizing the continued leadership role of California and other States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Passenger Cars and Light-Duty Trucks.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Building on the earlier joint rulemaking, and in order to provide greater certainty and incentives for long-term innovation by automobile and light-duty vehicle manufacturers, I request that the Administrators of the EPA and the NHTSA develop, through notice and comment rulemaking, a coordinated national program under the CAA and the EISA to improve fuel efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of passenger cars and light-duty trucks of model years 2017&ndash;2025. The national program should seek to produce joint Federal standards that are harmonized with applicable State standards, with the goal of ensuring that automobile manufacturers will be able to build a single, light-duty national fleet. The program should also seek to achieve substantial annual progress in reducing transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel consumption, consistent with my Administration's overall energy and climate security goals, through the increased domestic production and use of existing, advanced, and emerging technologies, and should strengthen the industry and enhance job creation in the United States. As part of implementing the national program, I request that the Administrators of the EPA and the NHTSA:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Work with the State of California to develop by September 1, 2010, a technical assessment to inform the rulemaking process, reflecting input from an array of stakeholders on relevant factors, including viable technologies, costs, benefits, lead time to develop and deploy new and emerging technologies, incentives and other flexibilities to encourage development and deployment of new and emerging technologies, impacts on jobs and the automotive manufacturing base in the United States, and infrastructure for advanced vehicle technologies; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Take all measures consistent with law to issue by September 30, 2010, a Notice of Intent to Issue a Proposed Rule that announces plans for setting stringent fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for light-duty vehicles of model year 2017 and beyond, including plans for initiating joint rulemaking and gathering any additional information needed to support regulatory action. The Notice should describe the key elements of the program that the EPA and the NHTSA intend jointly to propose, under their respective statutory authorities, including potential standards that could be practicably implemented nationally for the 2017&ndash;2025 model years and a schedule for setting those standards as expeditiously as possible, consistent with providing sufficient lead time to vehicle manufacturers.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Cleaner Vehicles and Fuels and Necessary Infrastructure.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">The success of our efforts to achieve enhanced energy security and to protect the environment also depends upon the development of infrastructure and promotion of fuels, including biofuels, which will enable the development and widespread deployment of advanced technologies. Therefore, I further request that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Administrator of the EPA review for adequacy the current nongreenhouse gas emissions regulations for new motor vehicles, new motor vehicle engines, and motor vehicle fuels, including tailpipe emissions standards for nitrogen oxides and air toxics, and sulfur standards for gasoline. If the Administrator of the EPA finds that new emissions regulations are required, then I request that the Administrator of the EPA promulgate such regulations as part of a comprehensive approach toward regulating motor vehicles; and [sic]</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Energy promote the deployment of advanced technology vehicles by providing technical assistance to cities preparing for deployment of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Department of Energy work with stakeholders on the development of voluntary standards to facilitate the robust deployment of advanced vehicle technologies and coordinate its efforts with the Department of Transportation, the NHTSA, and the EPA.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>General Provisions.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law, including international trade obligations, and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or proce<!-- PDFPage:692 -->dural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) authority granted by law to a department, agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>

The credits may be applied to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any of the 3 consecutive model years immediately before the model year for which the credits are earned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent not used under paragraph (1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#32903_1_target" name="32903_1">1</a></sup> any of the 5 consecutive model years immediately after the model year for which the credits are earned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Period of Availability and Plan for Future Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, credits under this section are available to a manufacturer at the end of the model year in which earned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Before the end of a model year, if a manufacturer has reason to believe that its average fuel economy for passenger automobiles will be less than the applicable standard for that model year, the manufacturer may submit a plan to the Secretary of Transportation demonstrating that the manufacturer will earn sufficient credits under this section within the next 3 model years to allow the manufacturer to meet that standard for the model year involved. Unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer is unlikely to earn sufficient credits under the plan, the Secretary shall approve the plan. Those credits are available for the model year involved if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary approves the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the manufacturer earns those credits as provided by the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer is less than the applicable standard under subsections (a) through (d) of section 32902 after applying credits under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the manufacturer and give the manufacturer a reasonable time (of at least 60 days) to submit a plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determining Number of Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The number of credits a manufacturer earns under this section equals the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of tenths of a mile a gallon by which the average fuel economy of the passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer in the model year in which the credits are earned exceeds the applicable average fuel economy standard under subsections (a) through (d) of section 32902; times</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the number of passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer during that model year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Applying Credits for Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall apply credits to a model year on the basis of the number of tenths of a mile a gallon by which the manufacturer involved was below the applicable average fuel economy standard for that model year and the number of passenger automobiles manufactured that model year by the manufacturer. Credits applied to a model year are no longer available for another model year. Before applying credits, the Secretary shall give the manufacturer written notice and reasonable opportunity to comment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applying Credits for Non-Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Credits for a manufacturer of automobiles that are not passenger automobiles are earned and applied to a model year in which the average fuel economy of that class of automobiles is below the applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(a) of this title, to the same extent and in the same way as provided in this section for passenger automobiles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Credit Trading Among Manufacturers.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may establish, by regulation, a fuel economy credit trading program to allow manufacturers whose automobiles exceed the average fuel economy standards prescribed under section 32902 to earn credits to be sold to manufacturers whose automobiles fail to achieve the prescribed standards such that the total oil savings associated with manufacturers that exceed the prescribed standards are preserved when trading credits to manufacturers that fail to achieve the prescribed standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The trading of credits by a manufacturer to the category of passenger automobiles manufactured domestically is limited to the extent that the fuel economy level of such automobiles shall comply with the requirements of section 32902(b)(4), without regard to any trading of credits from other manufacturers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Credit Transferring Within a Manufacturer's Fleet.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall establish by regulation a fuel economy credit transferring program to allow any manufacturer whose automobiles exceed any of the average fuel economy standards prescribed under section 32902 to transfer the credits earned under this section and to apply such credits within that manufacturer's fleet to a compliance category of automobiles that fails to achieve the prescribed standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Years for which used</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Credits transferred under this subsection are available to be used in the same model years that the manufacturer could have applied such credits <!-- PDFPage:693 -->under subsections (a), (b), (d), and (e), as well as for the model year in which the manufacturer earned such credits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Dedicated Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section or section 32904(a)(2) of this title, for any model of dedicated automobile manufactured by a manufacturer after model year 1992, the fuel economy measured for that model shall be based on the fuel content of the alternative fuel used to operate the automobile. A gallon of a liquid alternative fuel used to operate a dedicated automobile is deemed to contain .15 gallon of fuel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Dual Fueled Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section or section 32904(a)(2) of this title, for any model of dual fueled automobile manufactured by a manufacturer in model years 1993 through 2019, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall measure the fuel economy for that model by dividing 1.0 by the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) .5 divided by the fuel economy measured under section 32904(c) of this title when operating the model on gasoline or diesel fuel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) .5 divided by the fuel economy&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) measured under subsection (a) when operating the model on alternative fuel; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) measured based on the fuel content of B20 when operating the model on B20, which is deemed to contain 0.15 gallon of fuel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Gaseous Fuel Dedicated Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any model of gaseous fuel dedicated automobile manufactured by a manufacturer after model year 1992, the Administrator shall measure the fuel economy for that model based on the fuel content of the gaseous fuel used to operate the automobile. One hundred cubic feet of natural gas is deemed to contain .823 gallon equivalent of natural gas. The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the appropriate gallon equivalent of other gaseous fuels. A gallon equivalent of gaseous fuel is deemed to have a fuel content of .15 gallon of fuel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Gaseous Fuel Dual Fueled Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any model of gaseous fuel dual fueled automobile manufactured by a manufacturer in model years 1993 through 2019, the Administrator shall measure the fuel economy for that model by dividing 1.0 by the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) .5 divided by the fuel economy measured under section 32904(c) of this title when operating the model on gasoline or diesel fuel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) .5 divided by the fuel economy measured under subsection (c) of this section when operating the model on gaseous fuel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Fuel Economy Calculations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall calculate the manufacturer's average fuel economy under section 32904(a)(1) of this title for each model described under subsections (a)&ndash;(d) of this section by using as the denominator the fuel economy measured for each model under subsections (a)&ndash;(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Fuel Economy Incentive Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order for any model of dual fueled automobile to be eligible to receive the fuel economy incentives included in section 32906(a) and (b), a label shall be attached to the fuel compartment of each dual fueled automobile of that model, notifying that the vehicle can be operated on an alternative fuel and on gasoline or diesel, with the form of alternative fuel stated on the notice. This requirement applies to dual fueled automobiles manufactured on or after September 1, 2006.</p>

However, the amount of a penalty imposed under section 32912(b) may be compromised or remitted only to the extent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) necessary to prevent the insolvency or bankruptcy of the manufacturer of automobiles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the manufacturer shows that the violation was caused by an act of God, a strike, or a fire; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Federal Trade Commission certifies under subsection (b)(1) of this section that a reduction in the penalty is necessary to prevent a substantial lessening of competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Certification by Commission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer liable for a civil penalty under section 32912(b) of this title may apply to the Commission for a certification that a reduction in the penalty is necessary to prevent a substantial lessening of competition in the segment of the motor vehicle industry subject to the standard that was violated. The Commission shall make the certification when it finds that reduction is necessary to prevent the lessening. The Commission shall state in the certification the maximum amount by which the penalty may be reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application under this subsection must be made not later than 30 days after the Secretary decides that the manufacturer has violated section 32911(b) of this title. To the maximum extent practicable, the Commission shall make a decision on an application by the 90th day after the application is filed. A proceeding under this subsection may not delay the manufacturer's liability for the penalty for more than 90 days after the application is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a civil penalty is collected in a civil action under this chapter before a decision of the Commission under this subsection is final, the payment shall be paid to the court in which the action was brought. The court shall deposit the payment in the general fund of the Treasury on the 90th day after the decision of the Commission becomes final. When the court is holding payment of a penalty reduced under subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary shall direct the court to remit the appropriate amount of the penalty to the manufacturer.</p>
