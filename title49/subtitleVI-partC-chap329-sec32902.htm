<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Non-Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 18 months before the beginning of each model year, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by regulation average fuel economy standards for automobiles (except passenger automobiles) manufactured by a manufacturer in that model year. Each standard shall be the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretary decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year. The Secretary may prescribe separate standards for different classes of automobiles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a model year after model year 1984 shall be 27.5 miles a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Amending Passenger Automobile Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending the standard under subsection (b) of this section for a model year to a level that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for that model year. Section 553 of title 5 applies to a proceeding to amend the standard. However, any interested person may make an oral presentation and a transcript shall be taken of that presentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an amendment increases the standard above 27.5 miles a gallon or decreases the standard below 26.0 miles a gallon, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit the amendment to Congress. The procedures of section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6421) apply to an amendment, except that the 15 calendar days referred to in section 551(c) and (d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(c), (d)) are deemed to be 60 calendar days, and the 5 calendar days referred to in section 551(f)(4)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(f)(4)(A)) are deemed to be 20 calendar days. If either House of Congress disapproves the amendment under those procedures, the amendment does not take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, on application of a manufacturer that manufactured (whether in the United States or not) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the model year 2 years before the model year for which the application is made, the Secretary of Transportation may exempt by regulation the manufacturer from a standard under subsection (b) or (c) of this section. An exemption for a model year applies only if the manufacturer manufactures (whether in the United States or not) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the model year. The Secretary may exempt a manufacturer only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) finds that the applicable standard under those subsections is more stringent than the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the manufacturer can achieve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prescribes by regulation an alternative average fuel economy standard for the passenger automobiles manufactured by the exempted manufacturer that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for the manufacturers to which the alternative standard applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alternative average fuel economy standard the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection may apply to an individually exempted manufacturer, to all automobiles to which this subsection applies, or to classes of passenger automobiles, as defined under regulations of the Secretary, manufactured by exempted manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, an importer registered under section 30141(c) of this title may not be exempted as a manufacturer under paragraph (1) for a motor vehicle that the importer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) imports; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) brings into compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under chapter 301 of this title for an individual under section 30142 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe the contents of an application for an exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;emergency vehicle&rdquo; means an automobile manufactured primarily for use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as an ambulance or combination ambulance-hearse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by the United States Government or a State or local government for law enforcement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for other emergency uses prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:530 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) A manufacturer may elect to have the fuel economy of an emergency vehicle excluded in applying a fuel economy standard under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section. The election is made by providing written notice to the Secretary of Transportation and to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Considerations on Decisions on Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When deciding maximum feasible average fuel economy under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to conserve energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Requirements for Other Amendments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending an average fuel economy standard prescribed under subsection (a) or (d) of this section if the amended standard meets the requirements of subsection (a) or (d), as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary of Transportation prescribes an amendment under this section that makes an average fuel economy standard more stringent, the Secretary shall prescribe the amendment (and submit the amendment to Congress when required under subsection (c)(2) of this section) at least 18 months before the beginning of the model year to which the amendment applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsections (c), (f), and (g) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not consider the fuel economy of dedicated automobiles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall consider dual fueled automobiles to be operated only on gasoline or diesel fuel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in carrying out this section and section 32903 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Secretary of Energy Comments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Before issuing a notice proposing to prescribe or amend an average fuel economy standard under subsection (a), (c), or (g) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall give the Secretary of Energy at least 10 days from the receipt of the notice during which the Secretary of Energy may, if the Secretary of Energy concludes that the proposed standard would adversely affect the conservation goals of the Secretary of Energy, provide written comments to the Secretary of Transportation about the impact of the standard on those goals. To the extent the Secretary of Transportation does not revise a proposed standard to take into account comments of the Secretary of Energy on any adverse impact of the standard, the Secretary of Transportation shall include those comments in the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before taking final action on a standard or an exemption from a standard under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the Secretary of Energy and provide the Secretary of Energy a reasonable time to comment.</p>
