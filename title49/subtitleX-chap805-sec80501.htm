<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;A person .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be fined under title 18&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;It shall be unlawful for any person&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whoever violates any provision of subsection (a) of this section shall be fined not <!-- PDFPage:769 -->more than $5,000&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency with title 18. The word &ldquo;damaging&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;destroy or injure&rdquo; because it is inclusive. The words &ldquo;air carrier, motor carrier, or rail carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;common or contract carrier by railroad, motor vehicle, or aircraft&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;being transported&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;moving&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;In a criminal proceeding under this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;To establish the interstate or foreign commerce character of any property involved in any prosecution under this section&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;shipping document&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;waybill or similar shipping document&rdquo; because they are inclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;A person may not be prosecuted for an act under this section when the person has been convicted or acquitted on the merits for the same act&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;A judgment of conviction or acquittal on the merits .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be a bar to any prosecution under this chapter for the same act or acts&rdquo; for clarity. The word &ldquo;territory&rdquo; is added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of 48:734.</p>
