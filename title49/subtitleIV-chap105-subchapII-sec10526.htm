<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsections (a) and (b), before each clause (1), the words &ldquo;does not have jurisdiction under this subchapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Nothing in this chapter, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be construed to include&rdquo; for clarity and to conform to the terms used in chapter 105 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;except the provisions of section 304 of this title relative to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees and safety of operation or standards of equipment&rdquo; are <!-- PDFPage:206 -->omitted because, under section 6(e)(6)(C) of Public Law 89&ndash;670, those provisions were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;transporting only&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;employed solely in transporting&rdquo; to conform to the terms of the other clauses of the section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the words &ldquo;taxicabs, or other&rdquo; and &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;specified places&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fixed termini&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;railroad or other&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(5), the words &ldquo;so defined&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;between a place in a State and a place in another State, or between a place in a State and another place in the same State through another State&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;interstate transportation&rdquo; for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;any agency or instrumentality thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(5)(A)(i), (ii), and (iii), the words &ldquo;under this subchapter&rdquo; are substituted in each place for &ldquo;under this chapter&rdquo; because of the codification of the motor carrier jurisdictional provisions in subchapter II of chapter 105 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(5)(A)(ii) and (B), the word &ldquo;by&rdquo; is substituted in each place for &ldquo;in terms of&rdquo; to eliminate surplus words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (a)(6), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;or passengers&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement of the introductory matter.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(7), the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(9) restates the source provisions for clarity and consistency. The words following the comma in 49:309(a)(1) (last proviso), and the words &ldquo;under authorization, regulation, and control of the Secretary of the Interior&rdquo; in 49:303(b)(4), are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;in interstate or foreign commerce&rdquo; are omitted for consistency and as unnecessary because the Commission only has jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105 when interstate or foreign commerce is involved. See section 10521 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(B), the words &ldquo;regular or irregular&rdquo;, &ldquo;or routes&rdquo;, &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo;, and &ldquo;such interstate&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;between a place in a State and a place in another State, or a place in a State and another place in the same State through another State&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;interstate commerce&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;through which the route runs&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;having jurisdiction&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;interstate or foreign commerce for compensation&rdquo; are omitted for consistency and as unnecessary because the Commission only has jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105 when interstate or foreign commerce for compensation is concerned. The words &ldquo;passengers or property&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of &ldquo;transportation&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;procured or furnished or arranged for&rdquo; are omitted as surplus in view of the definition of &ldquo;broker&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title.</p>
