<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an airman certificate to an individual when the Administrator finds, after investigation, that the individual is qualified for, and physically able to perform the duties related to, the position to be authorized by the certificate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An airman certificate shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be numbered and recorded by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contain the name, address, and description of the individual to whom the certificate is issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contain terms the Administrator decides are necessary to ensure safety in air commerce, including terms on the duration of the certificate, periodic or special examinations, and tests of physical fitness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) specify the capacity in which the holder of the certificate may serve as an airman with respect to an aircraft; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) designate the class the certificate covers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A certificate issued to a pilot serving in scheduled air transportation shall have the designation &ldquo;airline transport pilot&rdquo; of the appropriate class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An individual whose application for the issuance or renewal of an airman certificate has been denied may appeal the denial to the National Transportation Safety Board, except if the individual holds a certificate that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is suspended at the time of denial; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) was revoked within one year from the date of the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board shall conduct a hearing on the appeal at a place convenient to the place of residence or employment of the applicant. The Board is not bound by findings of fact of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration but is bound by all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations the Administrator carries out unless the Board finds an interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not according to law. At the end of the hearing, the Board shall decide whether the individual meets the applicable regulations and standards. The Administrator is bound by that decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions and Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) restrict or prohibit issuing an airman certificate to an alien; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as provided in section 44710(e)(2) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:666 --><p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Modifications in System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall make modifications in the system for issuing airman certificates necessary to make the system more effective in serving the needs of pilots and officials responsible for enforcing laws related to the regulation of controlled substances (as defined in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802)). The modifications shall ensure positive and verifiable identification of each individual applying for or holding a certificate and shall address at least each of the following deficiencies in, and abuses of, the existing system:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the use of fictitious names and addresses by applicants for those certificates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the use of stolen or fraudulent identification in applying for those certificates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the use by an applicant of a post office box or &ldquo;mail drop&rdquo; as a return address to evade identification of the applicant's address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the use of counterfeit and stolen airman certificates by pilots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the absence of information about physical characteristics of holders of those certificates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations to carry out paragraph (1) of this subsection and provide a written explanation of how the regulations address each of the deficiencies and abuses described in paragraph (1). In prescribing the regulations, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consult with the Administrator of Drug Enforcement, the Commissioner of Customs, other law enforcement officials of the United States Government, representatives of State and local law enforcement officials, representatives of the general aviation aircraft industry, representatives of users of general aviation aircraft, and other interested persons.</p>

On receiving an application for a type certificate, the Administrator shall investigate the application and may conduct a hearing. The Administrator shall make, or require the applicant to make, tests the Administrator considers necessary in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify in regulations those appliances that reasonably require a type certificate in the interest of safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include in a type certificate terms required in the interest of safety; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking an airman certificate issued an individual under section 44703 of this title after the individual is convicted, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance), of an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator has no authority under paragraph (1) of this subsection to review whether an airman violated a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance.</p>

However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a detailed analysis of, and response to, all information the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency submitted with the proposed regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a detailed explanation of why no regulation is being prescribed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation and Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency believes that the action of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under subsection (c)(1)(B) or (2) of this section does not protect the public health and welfare from aircraft noise or sonic boom, consistent with the considerations in subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall consult with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and may request a report on the advisability of prescribing the regulation as originally proposed. The request, including a detailed statement of the information on which the request is based, shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall report to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency within the time, if any, specified in the request. However, the time specified must be at least 90 days after the date of the request. The report shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be accompanied by a detailed statement of the findings of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the reasons for the findings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify any statement related to an action under subsection (c) of this section filed under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C));</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specify whether and where that statement is available for public inspection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be published in the Federal Register unless the request proposes specific action by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the report indicates that action will be taken.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Supplemental Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may request the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to file a supplemental report if the report under subsection (d) of this section indicates that the proposed regulations under subsection (c) of this section, for which a statement under section 102(2)(C) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required, should not be prescribed. The supplemental report shall be published in the Federal Register within the time the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency specifies. However, the time specified must be at least 90 days after the date of the request. The supplemental report shall contain a comparison of the environmental effects, including those that cannot be avoided, of the action of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the proposed regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An exemption from a standard or regulation prescribed under this section may be granted only if, before granting the exemption, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration consults with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. However, if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration finds that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires an exemption before the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency can be consulted, the exemption may be granted. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as soon as practicable after the exemption is granted.</p>
