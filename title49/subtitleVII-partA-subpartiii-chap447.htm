<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include in a type certificate terms required in the interest of safety; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) record on the certificate a numerical specification of the essential factors related to the performance of the aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller for which the certificate is issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Special rules for new aircraft and appliances</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in paragraph (4), if the holder of a type certificate agrees to permit another person to use the certificate to manufacture a new aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance, the holder shall provide the other person with written evidence, in a form acceptable to the Administrator, of that agreement. Such other person may manufacture a new aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance based on a type certificate only if such other person is the holder of the type certificate or has permission from the holder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Limitation for aircraft manufactured before august 5, 2004</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (3) shall not apply to a person who began the manufacture of an aircraft before August 5, 2004, and who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that such manufacture began before August 5, 2004, if the name of the holder of the type certificate for the aircraft does not appear on the airworthiness certificate or identification plate of the aircraft. The holder of the type certificate for the aircraft shall not be responsible for the continued airworthiness of the aircraft. A person may invoke the exception provided by this paragraph with regard to the manufacture of only one aircraft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the holder of a supplemental type certificate agrees to permit an<!-- PDFPage:916 -->other person to use the certificate to modify an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance, the holder shall provide the other person with written evidence, in a form acceptable to the Administrator, of that agreement. A person may change an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance based on a supplemental type certificate only if the person requesting the change is the holder of the supplemental type certificate or has permission from the holder to make the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Production Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall issue a production certificate authorizing the production of a duplicate of an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance for which a type certificate has been issued when the Administrator finds the duplicate will conform to the certificate. On receiving an application, the Administrator shall inspect, and may require testing of, a duplicate to ensure that it conforms to the requirements of the certificate. The Administrator may include in a production certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Airworthiness Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The registered owner of an aircraft may apply to the Administrator for an airworthiness certificate for the aircraft.

The Administrator shall register each airworthiness certificate and may include appropriate information in the certificate. The certificate number or other individual designation the Administrator requires shall be displayed on the aircraft. The Administrator may include in an airworthiness certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person applying for the issuance or renewal of an airworthiness certificate for an aircraft for which ownership has not been recorded under section 44107 or 44110 of this title must submit with the application information related to the ownership of the aircraft the Administrator decides is necessary to identify each person having a property interest in the aircraft and the kind and extent of the interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Design Organization Certificates.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Beginning 7 years after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Administrator may issue a design organization certificate to a design organization to authorize the organization to certify compliance with the requirements and minimum standards prescribed under section 44701(a) for the type certification of aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, or appliances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On receiving an application for a design organization certificate, the Administrator shall examine and rate the design organization submitting the application, in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Administrator, to determine whether the design organization has adequate engineering, design, and testing capabilities, standards, and safeguards to ensure that the product being certificated is properly designed and manufactured, performs properly, and meets the regulations and minimum standards prescribed under section 44701(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of type certificates based on design organization certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may rely on certifications of compliance by a design organization when making a finding under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Public safety</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall include in a design organization certificate issued under this subsection terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>No effect on power of revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection affects the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to revoke a certificate.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; has the same meaning given that term in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking an airman certificate issued an individual under section 44703 of this title after the individual is convicted, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance), of an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an aircraft was used to commit, or facilitate the commission of, the offense; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to answer the charges and be heard why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An individual whose certificate is revoked by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section may appeal the revocation order to the National Transportation Safety Board.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When an individual files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Board shall make a final disposition of the appeal not later than 60 days after the Administrator so advises the Board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator has revoked an airman certificate under this section because of an activity described in subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section, the Administrator shall reissue a certificate to the individual if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the individual otherwise satisfies the requirements for a certificate under section 44703 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the individual subsequently is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the conviction on which a revocation under subsection (b)(1) of this section is based is reversed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Waivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may waive the requirement of subsection (b) of this section that an airman certificate of an individual be revoked if&mdash;</p>

The request, including a detailed statement of the information on which the request is based, shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall report to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency within the time, if any, specified in the request.

The supplemental report shall be published in the Federal Register within the time the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency specifies. However, the time specified must be at least 90 days after the date of the request. The supplemental report shall contain a comparison of the environmental effects, including those that cannot be avoided, of the action of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the proposed regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An exemption from a standard or regulation prescribed under this section may be granted only if, before granting the exemption, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration consults with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
