<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may not fail to comply with a regulation prescribed or order issued by the Secretary of Transportation under chapter 201 of this title. Subject to section 21304 of this title, a person violating a regulation prescribed or order issued by the Secretary under chapter 201 is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty. The Secretary shall impose the penalty applicable under paragraph (2) of this subsection. A separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall include in, or make applicable to, each regulation prescribed and order issued under chapter 201 of this title a civil penalty for a violation. The amount of the penalty shall be at least $500 but not more than $10,000. However, when a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has caused an imminent hazard of death or injury to individuals, or has caused death or injury, the amount may be not more than $20,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may compromise the amount of a civil penalty imposed under this subsection to not less than $500 before referring the matter to the Attorney General for collection. In determining the amount of a compromise, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of violations, the ability to pay, and any effect on the ability to continue to do business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) other matters that justice requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Setoff</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government may deduct the amount of a civil penalty imposed or compromised under this section from amounts it owes the person liable for the penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Deposit in Treasury</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil penalty collected under this section or section 20113(b) of this title shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;impose&rdquo; and &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;assessed&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the first 2 sentences are substituted for 45:438(a) and (c) (1st sentence) for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;(including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, <!-- PDFPage:423 -->lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 1:1 and because the provision being violated indicates to whom it applies. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in 45:438(c) (1st sentence) is retained from the source provisions. For a discussion of whether the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to impose a penalty is mandatory or permissive, see <em>Railway Labor Executives&rsquo; Ass'n</em> v. <em>Dole</em>, 760 F.2d 1021, 1024, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985); H.R. Conf. Rept. No. 100&ndash;637, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20; 134 Cong. Rec. H3470, May 23, 1988 (daily ed.); 134 Cong. Rec. S7510, June 9, 1988 (daily ed.). See also 134 Cong. Rec. E1946, June 10, 1988 (daily ed.). For an extended discussion of FRA's prosecutorial discretion, see <em>Nationwide Rail Safety: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Transportation, Tourism, and Hazardous Materials of the House Energy and Commerce Committee</em>, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 54&ndash;65 (1987). See also section 6 of this bill that provides that this bill restates, without substantive change, the provisions of law replaced by this bill, and that this bill may not be construed as making a substantive change in the law restated. Therefore, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this subsection has the same meaning it has under existing law. The words &ldquo;A separate violation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a separate offense&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;may compromise the amount .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to not less than $500&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may, however, be compromised .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for any amount, but in no event for an amount less than the minimum provided in subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (B), the words &ldquo;prior or subsequent&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;deposited in&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;covered into&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
