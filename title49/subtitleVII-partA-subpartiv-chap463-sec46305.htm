<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A civil penalty under this chapter may be collected by bringing a civil action against the person subject to the penalty, a civil action in rem against an aircraft subject to a lien for a penalty, or both. The action shall conform as nearly as practicable to a civil action in admiralty, regardless of the place an aircraft in a civil action in rem is seized. However, a party may demand a jury trial of an issue of fact in an action involving a civil penalty under this chapter (except a penalty imposed by the Secretary of Transportation that formerly was imposed by the Civil Aeronautics Board) if the value of the matter in controversy is more than $20. Issues of fact tried by a jury may be reexamined only under common law rules.</p>

<p class="note-body">The text of 49 App.:1473(b)(4) is omitted because of 28:ch. 131. The words &ldquo;imposed or assessed&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;bringing a civil action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;proceedings in personam&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;civil action in rem&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;proceedings in rem&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;civil action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;civil suits&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words &ldquo;regardless of the place an aircraft in a civil action in rem is seized&rdquo; are substituted for 49 App.:1473(b)(1) (last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words. The word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; is added after &ldquo;involving a&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;(except a penalty imposed by the Secretary of Transportation that formerly was imposed by the Civil Aeronautics Board)&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;other than those assessed by the Board&rdquo; because the Civil Aeronautics Board went out of existence and its duties and powers were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
