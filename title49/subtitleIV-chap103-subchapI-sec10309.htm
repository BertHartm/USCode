<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate makes a written request for a record in the possession or under the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission related to a matter involving a rail carrier providing transportation subject to this subtitle, the Commission shall send that record or a copy to the committee by the 10th day after the date of receipt of the request. If the record is not sent, the Commission shall send a written report to that committee within the 10-day period stating the reason why the record has not been sent and the anticipated date on which it will be sent. If the Commission transfers a record in its possession or under its control to another department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government, or to a person, it must condition the transfer on the guaranteed return of the record by the transferee to the Commission so that the Commission can comply with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a record obtained by the Commission from a person subject to regulation by it if the record contains trade secrets or commercial or financial information of a privileged or confidential nature. Subsection (a) of this section does not limit other authority of Congress, either House of Congress, or a committee or subcommittee of either House, to obtain a record.</p>

<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Committee on Commerce&rdquo; to conform to the amendment made to Senate Rule XXV changing the name of the committee. The word &ldquo;record&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;document&rdquo; for consistency with other sections of the revised title and with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. In view of the substitution, the last sentence of 49:17(15) is omitted as unnecessary. The word &ldquo;send&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;submit&rdquo; as being more appropriate.</p>
