The Secretary may request and receive appropriate information from any source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make a grant under section 5307 of this title only if the applicant, and any person that will receive benefits directly from the grant, are subject to the reporting and uniform systems.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the State's efforts to extend public mass transportation services to unserved rural areas; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) examine the relative levels of Government mass transportation assistance and services in urban and rural areas in the fiscal year that ended September 30, 1991, and the extent to which the assistance and service has changed in later fiscal years because of mass transportation resources made available under this chapter and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 1914).</p>
