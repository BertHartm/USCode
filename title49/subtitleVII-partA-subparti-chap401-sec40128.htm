<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in accordance with this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in accordance with conditions and limitations prescribed for that operator by the Administrator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in accordance with any applicable air tour management plan for the park or tribal lands.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Application for operating authority.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Application required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before commencing commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands, a commercial air tour operator shall apply to the Administrator for authority to conduct the operations over the park or tribal lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Competitive bidding for limited capacity parks</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever an air tour management plan limits the number of commercial air tour operations over a national park during a specified time frame, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall issue operation specifications to commercial air tour operators that conduct such operations. The operation specifications shall include such terms and conditions as the Administrator and the Director find necessary for management of commercial air tour operations over the park. The Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall develop an open competitive process for evaluating proposals from persons interested in providing commercial air tour operations over the park. In making a selection from among various proposals submitted, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall consider relevant factors, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the safety record of the person submitting the proposal or pilots employed by the person;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for safety requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (c), an existing commercial air tour operator shall apply, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, for operating authority under part 119, 121, or 135 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations. A new entrant commercial air tour operator shall apply for such authority before conducting commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands.
