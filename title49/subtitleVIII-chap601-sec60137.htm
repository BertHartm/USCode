Each plan must include, among the measures to reduce such risks, a maximum limit on the hours of service established by the operator for individ<!-- PDFPage:1090 -->uals employed as controllers in a control center for the pipeline.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review and Approval of the Plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary or, in the case of an operator of an intrastate pipeline located within the boundaries of a State that has in effect an annual certification under section 60105, the head of the appropriate State authority, shall review and approve each plan submitted to the Secretary or the head of such authority under subsection (a). The Secretary and the head of such authority may not approve a plan that does not include a maximum limit on the hours of service established by the operator of the pipeline for individuals employed as controllers in a control center for the pipeline.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With the Plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each operator of a gas or hazardous liquid pipeline shall document compliance with the plan submitted by the operator under subsection (a) and the reasons for any deviation from compliance with such plan.
