However, the Commission may not delegate a matter required to be referred to a joint board under section 10341 of this title, or a function vested in the Commission under this chapter. The Commission may change or rescind a delegation under this subsection at any time. When a Commissioner or employee cannot act on a matter delegated under this section because of absence or another reason, the Chairman of the Commission may designate another Commissioner or employee, as the case may be, to serve temporarily until the Commission otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Delegation to a division of a matter related to the validity of rates shall be made according to the character of regulation exercised. The delegation of any such matter may not be made according to the kind or class of carrier involved or to the form or mode of transportation in which that carrier may be engaged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A division, individual Commissioner, employee board, or an employee may act on a matter delegated under subsection (a) of this section. When acting under this section, a division, individual Commissioner, board, or an employee has the same power and authority and is subject to the same duties and obligations as the Commission. Action taken under this section has the same force and is taken in the same manner as if taken by the Commission.</p>

The deadlines set forth in this section do not apply to the following sections of this title: 10525(c), 10530, 10708(b), 10708(f), 10922(i)(2),<sup><a href="#10322_1_target" name="10322_1">1</a></sup> 10922(i)(4),<sup><a href="#10322_1_target" name="10322_1">1</a></sup> 10928, 10934(c), 10935, 11345a, and 11701(c). In addition, the deadlines set forth in this section do not apply to any application filed under section 10922(c)(2)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10322_1_target" name="10322_1">1</a></sup> of this title for authority to provide regular-route transportation entirely in one State as a motor common carrier of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a division, individual commissioner, employee board, or an employee delegated under section 10305 of this title to make an initial decision in a matter related to a carrier (other than a rail carrier), or, in the case of a matter referred to a joint board under section 10341 of this title, such joint board&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall, in any case in which an oral hearing is held or the Commission has found that an issue of general transportation importance is involved, complete all evidentiary proceedings related to the matter not later than the 180th day following institution of the proceeding and shall issue in writing the initial decision not later than the 270th day following institution of the proceeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall, in the case of all other proceedings subject to this section, issue in writing the initial decision by the 180th day following institution of the proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If evidence is submitted in writing or testimony is taken at an oral hearing, the initial decision shall include specific findings of fact, specific and separate conclusions of law, an order, and justification for the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case involving an application for authority to provide motor carrier transportation incidental to trailer-on-flatcar or container-on-flatcar service by rail under subchapter II of chapter 109 of this subtitle, a final decision on such application shall be issued in writing not later than the 180th day following the date such application is filed with the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the earliest practicable time after the filing of an application for authority under subchapter II of chapter 109 of this title, the Commission shall publish notice of the filing of such application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission, or a division designated by the Commission, may waive the requirement for an initial decision under subsection (b) of this section and may require the matter to be considered by the Commission or such division on finding that the matter involves a question of Commission policy, a new or novel issue of law, or an issue of general transportation importance or that waiver of the initial decision is required for the timely execution of the Commission's functions. If the requirement for an initial decision is waived, a final decision shall be issued in writing within the time limit established for the issuance of the initial decision under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section in which the parties have had at least an opportunity to submit evidence in written form, such parties shall have an opportunity to present arguments to the initial decisionmaker. The decisionmaker shall determine whether the arguments should be presented orally or in writing and may require that written arguments be submitted simultaneously with written submissions of evidence and that oral arguments be presented at an oral hearing. Upon issuance of an initial decision under this section, copies of such decision shall be served on the parties and submitted to the Commission.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Before an initial decision under this section becomes a final decision, the Commission or a division or an employee board designated by the Commission, may review the initial decision on its own initiative and shall review an initial decision if a timely appeal is filed under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An initial decision may be reviewed on the record on which it is based or by a further hearing. If an initial decision is reviewed, it shall be stayed pending final determination of the matter and it becomes a final decision only after the final determination is made. If a timely appeal is filed under subsection (e) of this section, the final determination shall be made not later than the 50th day after the appeal is filed. If an initial decision under this section is reviewed by the Commission or a division or an employee board designated by the Commission on its own initiative, the final decision shall be made not later than the 50th day after initiation of such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, if an initial decision under this section is reviewed by further hearing, such review shall be completed, and a final decision made, not later than the 120th day following the date the further hearing is granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Review of, or appeal from, an initial decision under this section shall be conducted under section 557 of title 5. The Commission may prescribe rules limiting and defining the issues and pleadings on review under subsection (b) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Commission may, at any time on its own initiative because of material error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reopen a proceeding;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action involved a matter of general transportation importance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the action would be affected materially because of clear and convincing new evidence or changed circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission.

<h4 class="note-head">Explanation of Senate Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1(1) of the bill amends section 10324(c) of title 49, United States Code. The amendment mistakenly used the adjective &ldquo;initial&rdquo; in reference to an administrative decision. Secondly, the words &ldquo;an action of the Commission&rdquo; were inadvertently substituted for the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo;. Finally, the words &ldquo;those sections&rdquo; [in section 2 of the bill] were inadvertently substituted for the words &ldquo;that section&rdquo;. These amendments correct the errors in the House passed bill and ensure that the codification conforms to the underlying source laws.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">1980&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 96&ndash;296, &sect;25(c)(1), struck out provision that an action of the Commission in a proceeding involving a motor carrier, a broker, a water carrier, or freight forwarder not take effect for 30 days.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 96&ndash;296, &sect;25(c)(2), substituted provision making an action by the Commission under section 10327 of this title enforceable unless the Commission stays or postpones it for provision making an action by the Commission enforceable unless application for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration was made under section 10323 of this title before the effective date of the action or the Commission stayed or postponed it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If a petition is denied or action is not taken within the 120-day period under subsection (a) of this section, the petitioner may begin a civil action in an appropriate court of appeals of the United States for an order directing the Commission to begin a proceeding to take the action requested in the petition. A civil action under this subsection must be filed by the 60th day after the date of the denial or by the 60th day after the end of the 120-day period, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court of appeals shall order the Commission to begin the action requested in the petition to the Commission if the court finds that the action requested in that petition is necessary and failure to take that action will result in the continuation of practices that are not consistent with the public interest or are not in accordance with this subtitle. The finding of the court must be based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record before the Commission or its delegate, or, if the civil action is based on a petition on which action was not taken, in a new proceeding before the court. The court may not require the Commission to take action under this subtitle other than to begin a rulemaking proceeding.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10327. Commission action and appellate procedure in rail carrier proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) This section applies to a matter before the Interstate Commerce Commission involving a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title. However, other sections of this subtitle related to action of the Commission in proceedings involving rail carriers supersede this section to the extent that they are inconsistent with the provisions of this section related to deadlines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A division, individual Commissioner, employee board, or employee delegated under section 10305 of this title to make an initial decision in a matter related to one of those rail carriers shall complete all evidentiary proceedings related to the matter by the 180th day after assignment of the matter. The initial decision shall be submitted to the Commission in writing. If evidence is submitted in writing or testimony is taken at a public hearing, the initial decision shall be submitted to the Commission in writing by the 120th day after completion of all evidentiary proceedings and shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) specific findings of fact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specific and separate conclusions of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) justification of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission, or a division designated by the Commission, may void the requirement of an initial decision under subsection (b) of this section and may require the matter to be considered by the Commission or that division on finding that the matter involves a question of Commission policy, a new or novel issue of law, or an issue of general transportation importance, or that it is required for the timely execution of its functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section, after the parties have had at least an opportunity to submit evidence in written form, the Commission shall give them an opportunity for briefs, written statements, or conferences of the parties. A conference of the parties must be chaired by a division, an individual Commissioner, an employee board, an employee delegated to act under section 10305 of this title, or an employee designated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Copies of an initial decision under subsection (b) of this section shall be served on the interested parties. An initial decision becomes an action of the Commission on the 20th day after it is served on the interested parties, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an interested party files an appeal during the 20-day period, or by the end of an additional period of not more than 20 days, if authorized by the Commission or division designated by the Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Commission stays or postpones the initial decision under subsection (g)(2) or (j) of this section within the period or additional period referred to in clause (1) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Before an initial decision becomes an action of the Commission, the Commission, or a division or board designated by the Commission, may review the initial decision on its own initiative, and shall review an initial decision if an appeal is filed under subsection (e)(1) of this section. However, a board may not decide an appeal from an initial decision if the appeal may be further appealed to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An initial decision may be reviewed on the record on which it is based or by a further hearing. If an initial decision is reviewed, it shall be stayed pending final determination of the matter, and it is an action of the Commission only after the final determination is made. If an appeal is filed under subsection (e)(1) of this section, the final determination shall be made by the 180th day after the appeal is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Review of, or appeal from, an initial decision shall be conducted under section 557 of title 5. The Commission may prescribe rules limiting and defining the issues and pleadings on review under section 557(b) of that title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Commission may, at any time on its own initiative because of material error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reopen a proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) grant rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:185 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) change an action of the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition to reopen and reconsider an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may grant a rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission that was taken by a division designated by the Commission if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action involves a matter of general transportation importance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the action would be affected materially because of clear and convincing new evidence or changed circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission. The Commission may stay an action pending a final determination under this paragraph. The Commission shall complete reconsideration and take final action by the 120th day after the petition is granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) An action of the Commission under this section and an action of a designated division under subsection (c) of this section is effective on the 30th day after service on the parties to the proceeding unless the Commission provides for it to become effective on an earlier date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Notwithstanding this subtitle, an action of the Commission under this section and an action of a designated division under subsection (c) of this section is final on the date on which it is served, and a civil action to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside the action may be filed after that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Commission may extend a time period established by this section for a period of not more than 90 days. The extension shall be granted if a majority of the Commissioners agree to it by public vote.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) If an extension granted under subsection (j) of this section is not sufficient to allow for completion of necessary proceedings, the Commission may grant a further extension in an extraordinary situation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a majority of the Commissioners agree to the further extension by public vote; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not later than the 15th day before expiration of the extension granted under subsection (j) of this section, the Commission submits a written report to the Congress that a further extension has been granted. The report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a full explanation of the reasons for the further extension;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the anticipated duration of the further extension;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the issues involved in the matter before the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the names of personnel of the Commission working on the matter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A motor carrier, a broker, a water carrier, or a household goods freight forwarder providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 of this title shall designate an agent by name and post office address on whom service of notices in a proceeding before, and of actions of, the Commission may be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A designation under subsection (a) of this section shall be in writing and filed with the Commission. A motor carrier or broker providing transportation under a certificate or permit issued under this subtitle shall also file the designation with the authority of each State in which it operates having jurisdiction to regulate transportation by motor vehicle in intrastate commerce on the highways of that State. The designation may be changed at any time in the same manner as originally made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Except as otherwise provided, notices of the Commission shall be served as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A notice of the Commission to a rail, express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier is served on its designated agent at the office or usual place of residence in the District of Columbia of that agent. A notice of action of the Commission shall be served immediately on the agent or in another manner provided by law. If that carrier does not have a designated agent, service may be made by posting the notice in the office of the Secretary of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A notice to a motor carrier or broker is served personally or by mail on the motor carrier or broker or its designated agent. Service by mail on the designated agent is made at the address filed for the agent. When notice is given by mail, the date of mailing is considered to be the time when the notice is served. If a motor carrier or broker does not have a designated agent, service may be made by posting a copy of the notice in the office of the secretary or clerk of the authority having jurisdiction to regulate transportation by motor vehicle in intrastate commerce on the highways of the State in which the carrier or broker maintains headquarters and in the office of the Secretary of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A notice to a water carrier or household goods freight forwarder is served personally or <!-- PDFPage:187 -->by mail on the water carrier or household goods freight forwarder or its designated agent.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding involving the lawfulness of classifications, rates, or practices of (1) a rail, express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier that has not designated an agent under this section, or (2) a household goods freight forwarder, service of notice of the Commission on an attorney in fact who filed the tariff for the carrier constitutes service of notice on the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In a proceeding involving the lawfulness of classifications, rates, or practices&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) service of notice of the suspension of a tariff on an attorney in fact of a carrier or broker, except a freight forwarder, constitutes service of notice on the carrier or broker if that attorney filed the tariff and, if the carrier is a water carrier, the notice specifies the classifications, rates, or practices involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) service of notice of the suspension of a joint tariff or schedule on a carrier or a broker, except a freight forwarder, that filed that tariff or schedule to which another carrier or broker is a party and, if the carrier is a water carrier, the notice specifies the classifications, rates, or practices involved, constitutes service of notice on all carriers or brokers that are parties to the joint tariff.</p>

If there is no such authority in that State or if that authority does not nominate a member when requested by the Commission, the chief executive officer of the State may nominate the member. If both that State authority and the chief executive officer of that State do not nominate a member when requested, the board is constituted without a member from that State if the Commission has appointed members for at least 2 other States to the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a matter required to be referred to a joint board involves the operation of a motor carrier in or through a place outside the United States, if only one State is involved or if only one State nominates an individual to be a member of the joint board, that State may nominate and the Commission may appoint not more than 3 members to the board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a member of a joint board does not participate in a proceeding referred to that board, after notice of the proceeding, the State from which that member was appointed waives its right to act in that proceeding. The waiver does not affect the duty or power of remaining members of the board to continue the proceeding and make an initial decision.</p>
