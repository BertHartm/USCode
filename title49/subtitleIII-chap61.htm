<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to qualify for a grant under section 6106, each State shall submit to the Secretary a grant application under subsection (b). The State shall submit the application not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Application.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Upon application by a State, the Secretary shall review that State's one-call notification program, including the provisions for the implementation of the program and the record of compliance and enforcement under the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Based on the review under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine whether the State's one-call notification program meets the minimum standards for such a program set forth in section 6103 in order to qualify for a grant under section 6106.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In order to expedite compliance under this section, the Secretary may consult with the State as to whether an existing State one-call notification program, a specific modification thereof, or a proposed State program would result in a positive determination under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary shall prescribe the form and manner of filing an application under this section that shall provide sufficient information about a State's one-call notification program for the Secretary to evaluate its overall effectiveness. Such information may include the nature and reasons for exceptions from required participation, the types of enforcement available, and such other information as the Secretary deems necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The application of a State under paragraph (1) and the record of actions of the Secretary under this section shall be available to the public.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Alternative Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State is eligible to receive a grant under section 6106 if the State maintains an alternative one-call notification program that provides protection for public safety, excavators, and the environment that is equivalent to, or greater than, protection provided under a program that meets the minimum standards set forth in section 6103.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 3 years after the date of the enactment of this chapter, the Secretary shall begin to include the following information in reports submitted under section 60124 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a description of the extent to which each State has adopted and implemented the minimum Federal standards under section 6103 or maintains an alternative program under subsection (c);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an analysis by the Secretary of the overall effectiveness of each State's one-call notification program and the one-call notification systems operating under such program in achieving the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the impact of each State's decisions on the extent of required participation in one-call notification systems on prevention of damage to underground facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) areas where improvements are needed in one-call notification systems in operation in each State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose of Study of Damage Prevention Practices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of the study is to gath<!-- PDFPage:206 -->er information in order to determine which existing one-call notification systems practices appear to be the most effective in protecting the public, excavators, and the environment and in preventing disruptions to public services and damage to underground facilities. As part of the study, the Secretary shall consider, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the methods used by one-call notification systems and others to encourage participation by excavators and owners of underground facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the methods by which one-call notification systems promote awareness of their programs, including use of public service announcements and educational materials and programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the methods by which one-call notification systems receive and distribute information from excavators and underground facility owners;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the use of any performance and service standards to verify the effectiveness of a one-call notification system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the effectiveness and accuracy of mapping used by one-call notification systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the relationship between one-call notification systems and preventing damage to underground facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) how one-call notification systems address the need for rapid response to situations where the need to excavate is urgent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the extent to which accidents occur due to errors in marking of underground facilities, untimely marking or errors in the excavation process after a one-call notification system has been notified of an excavation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the extent to which personnel engaged in marking underground facilities may be endangered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the characteristics of damage prevention programs the Secretary believes could be relevant to the effectiveness of State one-call notification programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the effectiveness of penalties and enforcement activities under State one-call notification programs in obtaining compliance with program requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this chapter, the Secretary shall publish a report identifying those practices of one-call notification systems that are the most and least successful in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) preventing damage to underground facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing effective and efficient service to excavators and underground facility operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall encourage each State and operator of one-call notification programs to adopt and implement those practices identified in the report that the State determines are the most appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Secretarial Discretion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Prior to undertaking the study described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall determine whether timely information described in subsection (b) is readily available.
