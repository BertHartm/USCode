<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Existence and Amounts in Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation has a discretionary fund. The fund consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amounts subject to apportionment for a fiscal year that are not apportioned under section 47114(c)&ndash;(e) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 25 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsection (c) of this section and section 47117(e) of this title, the fund is available for making grants for any purpose for which amounts are made available under section 48103 of this title that the Secretary considers most appropriate to carry out this subchapter. However, 50 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f) and added to the fund is available for making grants for projects at small hub airports (as defined in section 41731 of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Percentage for Primary and Reliever Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 75 percent of the amount in the fund and distributed by the Secretary in a fiscal year shall be used for making grants&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to preserve and enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to carry out airport noise compatibility planning and programs at primary and reliever airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and enhance capacity as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the project benefit and cost; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:812 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport capacity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiving Percentage Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary decides the Secretary cannot comply with the percentage requirement of subsection (c) of this section in a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications to meet that percentage, the amount the Secretary determines will not be distributed as required by subsection (c) is available for obligation during the fiscal year without regard to the requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Diversion of Revenues in Awarding Discretionary Grants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), in deciding whether or not to distribute funds to an airport from the discretionary funds established by subsection (a) of this section and section 47116 of this title, the Secretary shall consider as a factor militating against the distribution of such funds to the airport the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local taxes on aviation fuel for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airports system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport and directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Required finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport's fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport's first fiscal year ending after the date of the enactment of this subsection, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47115_1_target" name="47115_1">1</a></sup> <cap-smallcap>Minimum Amount To Be Credited</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In a fiscal year, at least $325,000,000 of the amount made available under section 48103 of this title shall be credited to the fund. The amount credited is exclusive of amounts that have been apportioned in a prior fiscal year under section 47114 of this title and that remain available for obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a fiscal year in which the amount credited under subsection (a) of this section is less than $325,000,000, the total amount calculated under paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be reduced by an amount that, when credited to the fund, together with the amount credited under subsection (a), equals $325,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a fiscal year, the total amount available to reduce to carry out paragraph (2) of this subsection is the total of the amounts determined under sections 47114(c)(1)(A) and (2) and (d) and 47117(e) of this title. Each amount shall be reduced by an equal percentage to achieve the reduction.</p>
