<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:2226d(e)(1) is omitted because the complete name of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is used the first time the term appears in a section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Subject to subsections (c) and (d) of this section&rdquo; are added to alert the reader to the limitations in those subsections. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;requires making the contract with the domestic firm&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;so requires&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;considering United States international obligations and trade relations&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;In determining under this subsection whether the public interest so requires, the Administrator shall take into account United States international obligations and trade relations&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (4), the words &ldquo;when completely assembled&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;produced in the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;domestically produced&rdquo; for consistency with clause (3).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;(1) such applicability would not be in the public interest&rdquo; are omitted as redundant to subsection (b)(1) of the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e)(1), the words &ldquo;foreign firms&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;foreign entities&rdquo; for consistency in the revised section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:878 --><p class="note-body">Subsection (e)(3) is substituted for &ldquo;the number of contracts covered under this subtitle (including the amendments made by this subtitle) and awarded based upon the parameters of this section&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
