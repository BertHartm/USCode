<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 may establish a rate for the transportation of household goods which is based on the carrier's written, binding estimate of charges for providing such transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Nonpreferential; nonpredatory</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any rate established under this subsection must be available on a nonpreferential basis to shippers and must not result in charges to shippers which are predatory.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Rates for Guaranteed Service.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 may establish rates for the transportation of household goods which guarantee that the carrier will pick up and deliver such household goods at the times specified in the contract for such services and provide a penalty or per diem payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver such household goods at the specified time. The charges, if any, for such guarantee and penalty provision may vary to reflect one or more options available to meet a particular shipper's needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Authority of secretary to require nonguaranteed service rates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before a carrier may establish a rate for any service under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may require such carrier to have in effect and keep in effect, during any period such rate is in effect under paragraph (1), a rate for such service which does not guarantee the pick up and delivery of household goods at the times specified in the contract for such services and which does not provide a penalty or per diem payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver household goods at the specified time.</p>
