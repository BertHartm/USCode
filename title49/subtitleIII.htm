<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) complying with a requirement of the State, political subdivision, or tribe and a requirement of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter is not possible; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement of the State, political subdivision, or tribe, as applied or enforced, is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Substantive Differences</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section and unless authorized by another law of the United States, a law, regulation, order, or other requirement of a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe about any of the following subjects, that is not substantively the same as a provision of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter, is preempted:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the designation, description, and classification of hazardous material.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the design, manufacturing, fabricating, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a packaging or a container represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous material.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary of Transportation prescribes or has prescribed under section 5103(b), 5104, 5110, or 5112 of this title or prior comparable provision of law a regulation or standard related to a subject referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe may prescribe, issue, maintain, and enforce only a law, regulation, standard, or order about the subject that is substantively the same as a provision of this chapter or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter. The Secretary shall decide on and publish in the Federal Register the effective date of section 5103(b) of this title for any regulation or standard about any of those subjects that the Secretary prescribes after November 16, 1990. However, the effective date may not be earlier than 90 days after the Secretary prescribes the regulation or standard nor later than the last day of the 2-year period beginning on the date the Secretary prescribes the regulation or standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe imposes a fine or penalty the Secretary decides is appropriate for a violation related to a subject referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, an additional fine or penalty may not be imposed by any other authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Section</cap-smallcap> 5112(b) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, after the last day of the 2-year period beginning on the date a regulation is prescribed under section 5112(b) of this title, a State or Indian tribe may establish, maintain, or enforce a highway routing designation over which hazardous material may or may not be transported by motor vehicles, or a limitation or requirement related to highway routing, only if the designation, limitation, or requirement complies with section 5112(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A highway routing designation, limitation, or requirement established before the date a regulation is prescribed under section 5112(b) of this title does not have to comply with section 5112(b)(1)(B), (C), and (F).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This subsection and section 5112 of this title do not require a State or Indian tribe to comply with section 5112(b)(1)(I) if the highway routing designation, limitation, or requirement was established before November 16, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may allow a highway routing designation, limitation, or requirement to continue in effect until a dispute related to the designation, limitation, or requirement is resolved under section 5112(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Decisions on Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person (including a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe) directly affected by a re<!-- PDFPage:124 -->quirement of a State, political subdivision, or tribe may apply to the Secretary, as provided by regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for a decision on whether the requirement is preempted by subsection (a), (b)(1), or (c) of this section. The Secretary shall publish notice of the application in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall issue a decision on an application for a determination within 180 days after the date of the publication of the notice of having received such application, or the Secretary shall publish a statement in the Federal Register of the reason why the Secretary's decision on the application is delayed, along with an estimate of the additional time necessary before the decision is made. After notice is published, an applicant may not seek judicial relief on the same or substantially the same issue until the Secretary takes final action on the application or until 180 days after the application is filed, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After consulting with States, political subdivisions of States, and Indian tribes, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations for carrying out paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subsection (a) of this section does not prevent a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe, or another person directly affected by a requirement, from seeking a decision on preemption from a court of competent jurisdiction instead of applying to the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe may apply to the Secretary for a waiver of preemption of a requirement the State, political subdivision, or tribe acknowledges is preempted by subsection (a), (b)(1), or (c) of this section. Under a procedure the Secretary prescribes by regulation, the Secretary may waive preemption on deciding the requirement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides the public at least as much protection as do requirements of this chapter and regulations prescribed under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not an unreasonable burden on commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A party to a proceeding under subsection (d) or (e) of this section may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States for judicial review of the decision of the Secretary not later than 60 days after the decision becomes final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe may impose a fee related to transporting hazardous material only if the fee is fair and used for a purpose related to transporting hazardous material, including enforcement and planning, developing, and maintaining a capability for emergency response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A State or political subdivision thereof or Indian tribe that levies a fee in connection with the transportation of hazardous materials shall, upon the Secretary's request, report to the Secretary on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the basis on which the fee is levied upon persons involved in such transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the purposes for which the revenues from the fee are used;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the annual total amount of the revenues collected from the fee; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Development of Transportation Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is in the interest of the United States to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems that embrace various modes of transportation and efficiently maximize mobility of individuals and goods in and through urbanized areas and minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) more than 70 percent of the population of the United States is located in rapidly expanding urban areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into at least 2 States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the welfare and vitality of urban areas, the satisfactory movement of people and goods within those areas, and the effectiveness of programs aided by the United States Govern<!-- PDFPage:127 -->ment are jeopardized by deteriorating or inadequate urban transportation service and facilities, the intensification of traffic congestion, and the lack of coordinated, comprehensive, and continuing development planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) transportation is the lifeblood of an urbanized society, and the health and welfare of an urbanized society depend on providing efficient, economical, and convenient transportation in and between urban areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for many years the mass transportation industry capably and profitably satisfied the transportation needs of the urban areas of the United States but in the early 1970's continuing even minimal mass transportation service in urban areas was threatened because maintaining that transportation service was financially burdensome;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ending that transportation, or the continued increase in its cost to the user, is undesirable and may affect seriously and adversely the welfare of a substantial number of lower income individuals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) some urban areas were developing preliminary plans for, or carrying out, projects in the early 1970's to revitalize their mass transportation operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) significant mass transportation improvements are necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, international competitiveness, and mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals in urban and rural areas of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) financial assistance by the Government to develop efficient and coordinated mass transportation systems is essential to solve the urban transportation problems referred to in clause (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) immediate substantial assistance by the Government is needed to enable mass transportation systems to continue providing vital transportation service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rapid Urbanization and Continuing Population Dispersal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Rapid urbanization and continuing dispersal of the population and activities in urban areas have made the ability of all citizens to move quickly and at a reasonable cost an urgent problem of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Elderly Individuals and Individuals With Disabilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Government that elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities have the same right as other individuals to use mass transportation service and facilities. Special efforts shall be made in planning and designing mass transportation service and facilities to ensure that mass transportation can be used by elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities. All programs of the Government assisting mass transportation shall carry out this policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Preserving the Environment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Government that special effort shall be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside, public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and important historical and cultural assets when planning, designing, and carrying out an urban mass transportation capital project with assistance from the Government under sections 5309 and 5310 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>General Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assist in developing improved mass transportation equipment, facilities, techniques, and methods with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the planning and establishment of areawide urban mass transportation systems needed for economical and desirable urban development with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to assist States and local governments and their authorities in financing areawide urban mass transportation systems that are to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies as decided by local needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide financial assistance to State and local governments and their authorities to help carry out national goals related to mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish a partnership that allows a community, with financial assistance from the Government, to satisfy its urban mass transportation requirements.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [June 9, 1998], the Secretary [of Transportation] shall enter into an agreement with the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of the effect of contracting out mass transportation operation and administrative functions on cost, availability and level of service, efficiency, safety, quality of services provided to transit-dependent populations, and employer-employee relations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Terms of Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agreement entered into in subsection (a) shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Transportation Research Board, in conducting the study, consider the number of grant recipients that have contracted out services, the size of the population served by such grant recipients, the basis for decisions regarding contracting out, and the extent to which contracting out was affected by the integration and coordination of resources of transit agencies and other Federal agencies and programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the panel conducting the study shall include representatives of transit agencies, employees of transit agencies, private contractors, academic and policy analysts, and other interested persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 24 months after the date of entry into the agreement under subsection (a), the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a report containing the results of the study.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;240, title VIII, &sect;8004, Dec. 18, 1991, 105 Stat. 2206, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) current Federal policy places commuter transit benefits at a disadvantage compared to drive-to-work benefits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) this Federal policy is inconsistent with important national policy objectives, including the need to conserve energy, reduce reliance on energy imports, lessen congestion, and clean our Nation's air;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) commuter transit benefits should be part of a comprehensive solution to national transportation and air pollution problems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) current Federal law allows employers to provide only up to $21 per month in employee benefits for transit or van pools;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the current &lsquo;cliff provision&rsquo;, which treats an entire commuter transit benefit as taxable income if it exceeds $21 per month, unduly penalizes the most effective employer efforts to change commuter behavior;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) employer-provided commuter transit incentives offer many public benefits, including increased access of low-income persons to good jobs, inexpensive reduction of roadway and parking congestion, and cost-effective incentives for timely arrival at work; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) legislation to provide equitable treatment of employer-provided commuter transit benefits has been introduced with bipartisan support in both the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress strongly supports Federal policy that promotes increased use of employer-provided commuter transit benefits. Such a policy &lsquo;levels the playing field&rsquo; between transportation modes and is consistent with important national objectives of energy conservation, reduced reliance on energy imports, lessened congestion, and clean air.&rdquo;</p>

The reference to subsection (c)(2) is omitted as obsolete because section 201(d)(1) of the Housing and Community Development Technical Amendments Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;479, 98 Stat. 2228) repealed 12:1749a(c)(2).

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;regulatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulatory proceeding&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;rulemaking&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and because &ldquo;rule&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; are synonymous.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;Federal Transit Administration&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Urban Mass Transportation Administration&rdquo; because of section 3004(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 2088).

<p class="note-body">Subsection (i) is substituted for section 1(a)(1) (related to authority and functions reserved to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1968 to eliminate unnecessary words. The reference to 49 App.:1602(c)(1) is translated as a reference to 49 App.:1602(e)(1) because section 2(1) of the Urban Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970 (Public Law 91&ndash;453, 84 Stat. 962) redesignated subsection (c) as subsection (e). The references to 49 App.:1603(a) (1st sentence), 1604, and 1607c(b) and former 49 App.:1607a are omitted as obsolete because of section 103(a) of the National Mass Transportation Act of 1974 (Public Law 93&ndash;503, 88 Stat. 1567) and sections 303(b), 305(a), and 307 of the Federal Public Transportation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;599, 92 Stat. 2737, 2743, 2747).

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States Government to develop a National Intermodal Transportation System that is economically efficient and environmentally sound, provides the foundation for the United States to compete in the global economy, and will move individuals and property in an energy efficient way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>System Characteristics</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The National Intermodal Transportation System shall consist of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected manner, including the transportation systems of the future, to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development and supporting the United States&rsquo; preeminent position in international commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The National Intermodal Transportation System shall include a National Highway System consisting of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and those principal arterial roads that are essential for interstate and regional commerce and travel, national defense, intermodal transfer facilities, and international commerce and border crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The National Intermodal Transportation System shall include significant improvements in public transportation necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, international competitiveness, and mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals in urban and rural areas of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The National Intermodal Transportation System shall provide improved access to ports and airports, the Nation's link to commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The National Intermodal Transportation System shall give special emphasis to the contributions of the transportation sectors to increased productivity growth. Social benefits must be considered with particular attention to the external benefits of reduced air pollution, reduced traffic congestion, and other aspects of the quality of life in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The National Intermodal Transportation System must be operated and maintained with insistent attention to the concepts of innovation, competition, energy efficiency, productivity, growth, and accountability. Practices that resulted in the lengthy and overly costly construction of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways must be confronted and stopped.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The National Intermodal Transportation System shall be adapted to &ldquo;intelligent vehicles&rdquo;, &ldquo;magnetic levitation systems&rdquo;, and other new technologies, wherever feasible and economical, with benefit cost estimates given special emphasis on safety considerations and techniques for cost allocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) When appropriate, the National Intermodal Transportation System will be financed, as regards Government apportionments and reimbursements, by the Highway Trust Fund. Financial assistance will be provided to State and local governments and their instrumentalities to help carry out national goals related to mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The National Intermodal Transportation System must be the centerpiece of a national investment commitment to create the new wealth of the United States for the 21st century.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Distribution and Posting</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall distribute copies of the policy in subsections (a) and (b) of this section to each employee of the Department of Transportation and ensure that the policy is posted in all offices of the Department.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prior Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the first carrier to which any loaded container or trailer having a projected gross cargo weight of more than 29,000 pounds is tendered for intermodal transportation is a motor carrier, the person tendering the container or trailer shall give the motor carrier a notification of the gross cargo weight and a reasonable description of the contents of the container or trailer before the tendering of the container or trailer. The notification may be transmitted electronically or by telephone. This subsection applies to any person within the United States who tenders a container or trailer subject to this chapter for intermodal transportation if the first carrier is a motor carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Certification.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who tenders a loaded container or trailer with an actual gross cargo weight of more than 29,000 pounds to a first carrier for intermodal transportation shall provide a certification of the contents of the container or trailer in writing, or electronically, before or when the container or trailer is so tendered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents of certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The certification required by paragraph (1) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the actual gross cargo weight;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a reasonable description of the contents of the container or trailer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the identity of the certifying party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the container or trailer number; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the date of certification or transfer of data to another document, as provided for in paragraph (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of certification data</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A carrier who receives a certification may transfer the information contained in the certification to another document or to electronic format for forwarding to a subsequent carrier. The person transferring the information shall state on the forwarded document the date on which the data was transferred and the identity of the party who performed the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Shipping documents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this chapter, a shipping document, prepared <!-- PDFPage:212 -->by the person who tenders a container or trailer to a first carrier, that contains the information required by paragraph (2) meets the requirements of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Use of &ldquo;freight all kinds&rdquo; term</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;Freight All Kinds&rdquo; or &ldquo;FAK&rdquo; may not be used for the purpose of certification under section 5902(b) after December 31, 2000, as a commodity description for a trailer or container if the weight of any commodity in the trailer or container equals or exceeds 20 percent of the total weight of the contents of the trailer or container. This subsection does not prohibit the use of the term after that date for rating purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Separate document marking</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a separate document is used to meet the requirements of paragraph (1), it shall be conspicuously marked &ldquo;INTERMODAL CERTIFICATION&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection applies to any person, domestic or foreign, who first tenders a container or trailer subject to this chapter for intermodal transportation within the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Forwarding Certifications to Subsequent Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A carrier, agent of a carrier, broker, customs broker, freight forwarder, warehouser, or terminal operator shall forward the certification provided under subsection (b) of this section to a subsequent carrier transporting the container or trailer in intermodal transportation before or when the loaded intermodal container or trailer is tendered to the subsequent carrier. If no certification is received by the subsequent carrier before or when the container or trailer is tendered to it, the subsequent carrier may presume that no certification is required. The act of forwarding the certification may not be construed as a verification or affirmation of the accuracy or completeness of the information in the certification. If a person inaccurately transfers the information on the certification, or fails to forward the certification to a subsequent carrier, then that person is liable to any person who incurs any bond, fine, penalty, cost (including storage), or interest for any such fine, penalty, cost (including storage), or interest incurred as a result of the inaccurate transfer of information or failure to forward the certification. A subsequent carrier who incurs a bond, fine, penalty, or cost (including storage), or interest as a result of the inaccurate transfer of the information, or the failure to forward the certification, shall have a lien against the contents of the container or trailer under section 5905 in the amount of the bond, fine, penalty, or cost (including storage), or interest and all court costs and legal fees incurred by the carrier as a result of such inaccurate transfer or failure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Liability to Owner or Beneficial Owner</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a person inaccurately transfers information on a certification required by subsection (b)(1), or fails to forward a certification to the subsequent carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as a result of the inaccurate transfer of such information or a failure to forward a certification, the subsequent carrier incurs a bond, fine, penalty, or cost (including storage), or interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that subsequent carrier exercises its rights to a lien under section 5905,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then that person is liable to the owner or beneficial owner, or to any other person paying the amount of the lien to the subsequent carrier, for the amount of the lien and all costs related to the imposition of the lien, including court costs and legal fees incurred in connection with it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The notification and certification requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section do not apply to any intermodal container or trailer containing consolidated shipments loaded by a motor carrier if that motor carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) performs the highway portion of the intermodal movement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) assumes the responsibility for any weight-related fine or penalty incurred by any other motor carrier that performs a part of the highway transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subsections (a) and (b) of this section and section 5903(c) of this title do not apply to a carrier when the carrier is transferring a loaded container or trailer to another carrier during intermodal transportation, unless the carrier is also the person tendering the loaded container or trailer to the first carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A carrier, agent of a carrier, broker, customs broker, freight forwarder, warehouser, or terminal operator is deemed not to be a person tendering a loaded container or trailer to a first carrier under this section, unless the carrier, agent, broker, customs broker, freight forwarder, warehouser, or terminal operator assumes legal responsibility for loading property into the container or trailer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the use of any performance and service standards to verify the effectiveness of a one-call notification system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the effectiveness and accuracy of mapping used by one-call notification systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the relationship between one-call notification systems and preventing damage to underground facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) how one-call notification systems address the need for rapid response to situations where the need to excavate is urgent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the extent to which accidents occur due to errors in marking of underground facilities, untimely marking or errors in the excavation process after a one-call notification system has been notified of an excavation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the extent to which personnel engaged in marking underground facilities may be endangered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the characteristics of damage prevention programs the Secretary believes could be relevant to the effectiveness of State one-call notification programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the effectiveness of penalties and enforcement activities under State one-call notification programs in obtaining compliance with program requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this chapter, the Secretary shall publish a report identifying those practices of one-call notification systems that are the most and least successful in&mdash;</p>
