<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement of the State, political subdivision, or tribe, as applied or enforced, is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Substantive Differences</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section and unless authorized by another law of the United States, a law, regulation, order, or other requirement of a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe about any of the following subjects, that is not substantively the same as a provision of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter, is preempted:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the designation, description, and classification of hazardous material.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous material.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the design, manufacturing, fabricating, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a packaging or a container represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous material.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary of Transportation prescribes or has prescribed under section 5103(b), 5104, 5110, or 5112 of this title or prior comparable provision of law a regulation or standard related to a subject referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe may prescribe, issue, maintain, and enforce only a law, regulation, standard, or order about the subject that is substantively the same as a provision of this chapter or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter. The Secretary shall decide on and publish in the Federal Register the effective date of section 5103(b) of this title for any regulation or standard about any of those subjects that the Secretary prescribes after November 16, 1990. However, the effective date may not be earlier than 90 days after the Secretary prescribes the regulation or standard nor later than the last day of the 2-year period beginning on the date the Secretary prescribes the regulation or standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe imposes a fine or penalty the Secretary decides is appropriate for a violation related to a subject referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, an additional fine or penalty may not be imposed by any other authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Section</cap-smallcap> 5112(b) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, after the last day of the 2-year period beginning on the date a regulation is prescribed under section 5112(b) of this title, a State or Indian tribe may establish, maintain, or enforce a highway routing designation over which hazardous material may or may not be transported by motor vehicles, or a limitation or requirement related to highway routing, only if the designation, limitation, or requirement complies with section 5112(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A highway routing designation, limitation, or requirement established before the date a regulation is prescribed under section 5112(b) of this title does not have to comply with section 5112(b)(1)(B), (C), and (F).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This subsection and section 5112 of this title do not require a State or Indian tribe to comply with section 5112(b)(1)(I) if the highway routing designation, limitation, or requirement was established before November 16, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may allow a highway routing designation, limitation, or requirement to continue in effect until a dispute related to the designation, limitation, or requirement is resolved under section 5112(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Decisions on Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person (including a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe) directly affected by a requirement of a State, political subdivision, or tribe may apply to the Secretary, as provided by regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for a decision on whether the requirement is preempted by subsection (a), (b)(1), or (c) of this section. The Secretary shall publish notice of the application in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall issue a decision on an application for a determination within 180 days after the date of the publication of the notice of having received such application, or the Secretary shall publish a statement in the Federal Register of the reason why the Secretary's decision <!-- PDFPage:101 -->on the application is delayed, along with an estimate of the additional time necessary before the decision is made. After notice is published, an applicant may not seek judicial relief on the same or substantially the same issue until the Secretary takes final action on the application or until 180 days after the application is filed, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After consulting with States, political subdivisions of States, and Indian tribes, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations for carrying out paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subsection (a) of this section does not prevent a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe, or another person directly affected by a requirement, from seeking a decision on preemption from a court of competent jurisdiction instead of applying to the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Development of Transportation Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is in the interest of the United States to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems that embrace various modes of transportation and efficiently maximize mobility of individuals and goods in and through urbanized areas and minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) more than 70 percent of the population of the United States is located in rapidly expanding urban areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into at least 2 States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the welfare and vitality of urban areas, the satisfactory movement of people and goods within those areas, and the effectiveness of programs aided by the United States Government are jeopardized by deteriorating or inadequate urban transportation service and facilities, the intensification of traffic congestion, and the lack of coordinated, comprehensive, and continuing development planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) transportation is the lifeblood of an urbanized society, and the health and welfare of an urbanized society depend on providing efficient, economical, and convenient transportation in and between urban areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for many years the mass transportation industry capably and profitably satisfied the transportation needs of the urban areas of the United States but in the early 1970's continuing even minimal mass transportation service in urban areas was threatened because maintaining that transportation service was financially burdensome;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ending that transportation, or the continued increase in its cost to the user, is undesirable and may affect seriously and adversely the welfare of a substantial number of lower income individuals;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:104 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) some urban areas were developing preliminary plans for, or carrying out, projects in the early 1970's to revitalize their mass transportation operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) significant mass transportation improvements are necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, international competitiveness, and mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals in urban and rural areas of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) financial assistance by the Government to develop efficient and coordinated mass transportation systems is essential to solve the urban transportation problems referred to in clause (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) immediate substantial assistance by the Government is needed to enable mass transportation systems to continue providing vital transportation service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rapid Urbanization and Continuing Population Dispersal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Rapid urbanization and continuing dispersal of the population and activities in urban areas have made the ability of all citizens to move quickly and at a reasonable cost an urgent problem of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Elderly Individuals and Individuals With Disabilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Government that elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities have the same right as other individuals to use mass transportation service and facilities. Special efforts shall be made in planning and designing mass transportation service and facilities to ensure that mass transportation can be used by elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities. All programs of the Government assisting mass transportation shall carry out this policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Preserving the Environment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Government that special effort shall be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside, public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and important historical and cultural assets when planning, designing, and carrying out an urban mass transportation capital project with assistance from the Government under sections 5309 and 5310 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>General Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assist in developing improved mass transportation equipment, facilities, techniques, and methods with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the planning and establishment of areawide urban mass transportation systems needed for economical and desirable urban development with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to assist States and local governments and their authorities in financing areawide urban mass transportation systems that are to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies as decided by local needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide financial assistance to State and local governments and their authorities to help carry out national goals related to mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish a partnership that allows a community, with financial assistance from the Government, to satisfy its urban mass transportation requirements.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Commute-to-Work Benefits</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;240, title VIII, &sect;8004, Dec. 18, 1991, 105 Stat. 2206, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) current Federal policy places commuter transit benefits at a disadvantage compared to drive-to-work benefits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) this Federal policy is inconsistent with important national policy objectives, including the need to conserve energy, reduce reliance on energy imports, lessen congestion, and clean our Nation's air;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) commuter transit benefits should be part of a comprehensive solution to national transportation and air pollution problems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) current Federal law allows employers to provide only up to $21 per month in employee benefits for transit or van pools;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the current &lsquo;cliff provision&rsquo;, which treats an entire commuter transit benefit as taxable income if it exceeds $21 per month, unduly penalizes the most effective employer efforts to change commuter behavior;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) employer-provided commuter transit incentives offer many public benefits, including increased access of low-income persons to good jobs, inexpensive reduction of roadway and parking congestion, and cost-effective incentives for timely arrival at work; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) legislation to provide equitable treatment of employer-provided commuter transit benefits has been introduced with bipartisan support in both the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress strongly supports Federal policy that promotes increased use of employer-provided commuter transit benefits. Such a policy &lsquo;levels the playing field&rsquo; between transportation modes and is consistent with important national objectives of energy conservation, reduced reliance on energy imports, lessened congestion, and clean air.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that no metropolitan planning organization is allocated less than the amount it received by administrative formula under this section in the fiscal year that ended September 30, 1991. To carry out this subsection, the Secretary may make a proportionate reduction in other amounts made available to carry out section 5338(g)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Amounts available for an activity under this subsection are for 80 percent of the cost of the activity unless the Secretary of Transportation decides it is in the interests of the Government not to require a State or local match.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) capital projects for new fixed guideway systems, and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems, including the acquisition of real property, the initial acquisition of rolling stock for the systems, alternatives analysis related to the development of the systems, and the acquisition of rights of way, and relocation, for fixed guideway corridor development for projects in the advanced stages of alternatives analysis or preliminary engineering;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) capital projects, including property and improvements (except public highways other than fixed guideway facilities), needed for an efficient and coordinated mass transportation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the capital costs of coordinating mass transportation with other transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the introduction of new technology, through innovative and improved products, into mass transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) transportation projects that enhance urban economic development or incorporate private investment, including commercial and residential development, because the projects&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) enhance the effectiveness of a mass transportation project and are related physically or functionally to that mass transportation project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish new or enhanced coordination between mass transportation and other transportation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) mass transportation projects planned, designed, and carried out to meet the special needs of elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the development of corridors to support fixed guideway systems, including protecting <!-- PDFPage:117 -->rights of way through acquisition, construction of dedicated bus and high occupancy vehicle lanes and park and ride lots, and other nonvehicular capital improvements that the Secretary may decide would result in increased mass transportation usage in the corridor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Loans for Real Property Interests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may make loans under this section to State and local governmental authorities to acquire interests in real property for use on urban mass transportation systems as rights of way, station sites, and related purposes, including reconstruction, renovation, the net cost of property management, and relocation payments made under section 5324(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may make a loan under paragraph (1) of this subsection for an approved project only after finding that the property reasonably is expected to be required for a mass transportation system and that it will be used for that system within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An applicant for a loan under this subsection shall provide a copy of the application to the planning agency for the community affected by the project at the same time the application is submitted to the Secretary of Transportation. If the planning agency submits comments to the Secretary not later than 30 days after the application is submitted, or, if the agency requests more time within those 30 days, within a period the Secretary establishes, the Secretary shall consider those comments before taking final action on the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A loan agreement under this subsection shall provide that a capital project on the property will be started not later than 10 years after the fiscal year in which the agreement is made. If an interest in property acquired under this subsection is not used for the purpose for which it was acquired, an appraisal of the current value of the property or interest shall be made when a decision is made about the use. The decision shall be made within the 10-year period. Two-thirds of the increase in value shall be paid to the Secretary of Transportation for deposit in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A loan under this subsection must be repaid not later than 10 years after the date of the loan agreement or on the date a grant agreement for a capital project on the property is made, whichever is earlier. Payments made to repay the loan shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Decreased Commuter Rail Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall consider the adverse effect of decreased commuter rail transportation when deciding whether to approve a grant or loan under this section to acquire a rail line and all related facilities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) owned by a rail carrier subject to reorganization under title 11; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) used to provide commuter rail transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Project as Part of Approved Program of Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsections (b)(2) and (e) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation may approve a grant or loan for a project under this section only after finding that the project is part of the approved program of projects required under sections 5303&ndash;5306 of this title and that an applicant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has or will have the legal, financial, and technical capacity to carry out the project, satisfactory continuing control over the use of equipment or facilities, and the capability to maintain the equipment or facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will maintain the equipment or facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for Grants and Loans for Fixed Guideway Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) This subsection applies to a project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for which a letter of intent or contract for the complete amount is issued under subsection (g) of this section after April 1, 1987; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not in the preliminary engineering, final design, or construction stage on January 1, 1987.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may approve a grant or loan under this section for a capital project for a new fixed guideway system or extension of an existing fixed guideway system only if the Secretary decides that the proposed project is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) based on the results of an alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) justified based on a comprehensive review of its mobility improvements, environmental benefits, cost effectiveness, and operating efficiencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment, including evidence of stable and dependable financing sources to construct, maintain, and operate the system or extension.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making a decision under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the direct and indirect costs of relevant alternatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) account for costs related to factors such as congestion relief, improved mobility, air pollution, noise pollution, congestion, energy consumption, and all associated ancillary and mitigation costs necessary to carry out each alternative analyzed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) identify and consider mass transportation supportive existing land use policies and future patterns;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) consider the degree to which the project increases the mobility of the mass transportation dependent population or promotes economic development; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) consider other factors the Secretary considers appropriate to carry out this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary of Transportation shall issue guidelines on how the Secretary will evaluate results of alternatives analysis, project justification, and the degree of local financial commitment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The project justification under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be adjusted to reflect differences in local land, construction, and operating costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The degree of local financial commitment is acceptable only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the proposed project plan provides for the availability of contingency amounts the Sec<!-- PDFPage:118 -->retary of Transportation determines to be reasonable to cover unanticipated cost overruns;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) each proposed local source of capital and operating financing is stable, reliable, and available within the proposed project timetable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) local resources are available to operate the overall proposed mass transportation system (including essential feeder bus and other services necessary to achieve the projected ridership levels) without requiring a reduction in existing mass transportation services to operate the proposed project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In assessing the stability, reliability, and availability of proposed sources of local financing, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) existing grant commitments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the degree to which financing sources are dedicated to the purposes proposed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any debt obligation that exists or is proposed by the recipient for the proposed project or other mass transportation purpose.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A proposed project may advance from alternatives analysis to preliminary engineering only if the Secretary of Transportation finds that the project meets the requirements of this section and there is a reasonable chance that the project will continue to meet the requirements at the end of preliminary engineering.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) A new fixed guideway system or extension of an existing fixed guideway system is not subject to the requirements of this subsection, and the simultaneous evaluation of similar projects in at least 2 corridors in a metropolitan area may not be limited, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) located in a nonattainment area that is not an extreme or severe nonattainment area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a transportation control measure (as defined by the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) required to carry out the State Implementation Plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) This subsection does not apply to a part of a project (including a commuter rail transportation project on an existing right of way) financed completely with amounts for highways made available under part A of title I of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 1915).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A project financed under this subsection shall be carried out through a full financing grant agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Required Payments and Eligible Costs of Projects That Enhance Urban Economic Development or Incorporate Private Investment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each grant or loan under subsection (a)(5) of this section shall require that a person making an agreement to occupy space in a facility pay a reasonable share of the costs of the facility through rental payments and other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Eligible costs for a project under subsection (a)(5) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include property acquisition, demolition of existing structures, site preparation, utilities, building foundations, walkways, open space, and a capital project for, and improving, equipment or a facility for an intermodal transfer facility or transportation mall; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) do not include construction of a commercial revenue-producing facility or a part of a public facility not related to mass transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Letters of Intent, Full Financing Grant Agreements, and Early Systems Work Agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may issue a letter of intent to an applicant announcing an intention to obligate, for a project under this section, an amount from future available budget authority specified in law that is not more than the amount stipulated as the financial participation of the Secretary in the project. The amount shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment when a letter is issued for a fixed guideway project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least 30 days before issuing a letter under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify in writing the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate of the proposed issuance of the letter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The issuance of a letter is deemed not to be an obligation under sections 1108(c) and (d), 1501, and 1502(a) of title 31 or an administrative commitment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only when amounts are appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may make a full financing grant agreement with an applicant. The agreement shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) establish the terms of participation by the United States Government in a project under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) establish the maximum amount of Government financial assistance for the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) cover the period of time for completing the project, including a period extending beyond the period of an authorization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) make timely and efficient management of the project easier according to the law of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and may include a commitment, contingent on amounts to be specified in law in advance for commitments under this paragraph, to obligate an additional amount from future available budget authority specified in law. The agreement shall state that the contingent com<!-- PDFPage:119 -->mitment is not an obligation of the Government. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out a part of the project within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the project under a full financing grant agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. The amount stipulated in an agreement under this paragraph for a fixed guideway project shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may make an early systems work agreement with an applicant if a record of decision under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) has been issued on the project and the Secretary finds there is reason to believe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a full financing grant agreement for the project will be made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the terms of the work agreement will promote ultimate completion of the project more rapidly and at less cost.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A work agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and shall provide for reimbursement of preliminary costs of carrying out the project, including land acquisition, timely procurement of system elements for which specifications are decided, and other activities the Secretary of Transportation decides are appropriate to make efficient, long-term project management easier. A work agreement shall cover the period of time the Secretary considers appropriate. The period may extend beyond the period of current authorization. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out the work agreement within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. If an applicant does not carry out the project for reasons within the control of the applicant, the applicant shall repay all Government payments made under the work agreement plus reasonable interest and penalty charges the Secretary establishes in the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total estimated amount of future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments to incur obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent, full financing grant agreements, and early systems work agreements may be not more than the greater of the amount authorized under section 5338(a) of this title to carry out this section or 50 percent of the uncommitted cash balance remaining in the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund (including amounts received from taxes and interest earned that are more than amounts previously obligated), less an amount the Secretary of Transportation reasonably estimates is necessary for grants under this section not covered by a letter. The total amount covered by new letters and contingent commitments included in full financing grant agreements and early systems work agreements may be not more than a limitation specified in law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Government's Share of Net Project Cost</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Based on engineering studies, studies of economic feasibility, and information on the expected use of equipment or facilities, the Secretary of Transportation shall estimate the net project cost. A grant for the project is for 80 percent of the net project cost, unless the grant recipient requests a lower grant percentage. The remainder shall be provided in cash from a source other than amounts of the Government. Transit system amounts that make up the remainder must be from an undistributed cash surplus, a replacement or depreciation cash fund or reserve, or new capital. The remainder for a planned extension to a fixed guideway system may include the cost of rolling stock previously purchased if the applicant satisfies the Secretary that only amounts other than amounts of the Government were used and that the purchase was made for use on the extension. A refund or reduction of the remainder may be made only if a refund of a proportional amount of the grant of the Government is made at the same time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Loan Term Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except for a loan under subsection (b) of this section, a loan, including a renewal or extension of the loan, may be made, and a security or obligation may be bought, only if it has a maturity date of not more than 40 years. Interest on a loan may not be less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a rate the Secretary of the Treasury establishes, considering the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the Government that have remaining periods of maturity comparable to the average maturity of the loan, adjusted to the nearest .125 percent; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an allowance the Secretary of Transportation considers adequate to cover administrative costs and probable losses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Loan Payment Forgiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A grant agreement for a capital project may forgive repaying the loan and interest in place of a cash grant for the amount forgiven. The amount is part of the grant and part of the contribution of the Government to the cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Making Loans and Grants for Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may not make a loan under this section for a project for which a grant (except a relocation payment grant) is made under this section. However, the Secretary may make a project grant even though real property for the project has been or will be acquired through a loan under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l) </em><cap-smallcap>Fiscal Capacity Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Transportation gives priority consideration to financing projects that include more than the non-Government share required under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary shall give equal consideration to differences in the fiscal capacity of State and local governments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Allocating Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Of the amounts available for grants and loans under this section <!-- PDFPage:120 -->for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1993&ndash;1997&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 40 percent is available for fixed guideway modernization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 40 percent is available for capital projects for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 20 percent is available to replace, rehabilitate, and buy buses and related equipment and to construct bus-related facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At least 5.5 percent of the amounts available in each fiscal year under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection is available for areas other than urbanized areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not later than January 20 of each year, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit to the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a proposal on the allocation of amounts to be made available to finance grants and loans for capital projects for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems among applicants for those amounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A person applying for, or receiving, assistance for a project described in clause (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection may receive assistance for a project described in another of those clauses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) <cap-smallcap>Undertaking Projects in Advance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may pay the Government's share of the net project cost to a State or local governmental authority that carries out any part of a project described in this section or a substitute transit project described in section 103(e)(4) of title 23 without the aid of amounts of the Government and according to all applicable procedures and requirements if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State or local governmental authority applies for the payment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary approves the payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) before carrying out the part of the project, the Secretary approves the plans and specifications for the part in the same way as other projects under this section or section 103(e)(4) of title 23.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The cost of carrying out part of a project includes the amount of interest earned and payable on bonds issued by the State or local governmental authority to the extent proceeds of the bonds are expended in carrying out the part. However, the amount of interest under this paragraph may not be more than the most favorable interest terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financial terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Transportation shall consider changes in capital project cost indices when determining the estimated cost under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o) </em><cap-smallcap>Use of Deobligated Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount available under this section that is deobligated may be used for any purpose under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of Transportation finds the assistance is essential to a program of projects required under sections 5303&ndash;5306 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary of Transportation finds that the program, to the maximum extent feasible, provides for the participation of private mass transportation companies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Secretary of Labor certifies that the assistance complies with section 5333(b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) held that hearing unless no one with a significant economic, social, or environmental interest requested one;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) considered the economic, social, and environmental effects of the project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) found that the project is consistent with official plans for developing the urban area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notice of a hearing under this subsection shall include a concise description of the proposed project and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the geographic area the project will serve.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Buying and Operating Buses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Financial assistance under this chapter may be used to buy or operate a bus only if the applicant, governmental authority, or publicly owned operator that receives the assistance agrees that, except as provided in the agreement, the governmental authority or an operator of mass transportation for the governmental authority will not provide charter bus transportation service outside the urban area in which it provides regularly scheduled mass transportation service. An agreement shall provide for a fair arrangement the Secretary of Transportation considers appropriate to ensure that the assistance will not enable a governmental authority or an operator for a governmental authority to foreclose a private operator from providing intercity charter bus service if the private operator can provide the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receiving a complaint about a violation of an agreement, the Secretary of Transportation shall investigate and decide whether a violation has occurred. If the Secretary decides that a violation has occurred, the Secretary shall correct the violation under terms of the agreement.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) unless a private schoolbus operator can provide adequate transportation that complies with applicable safety standards at reasonable rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to a State or local governmental authority if it or a direct predecessor in interest from which it acquired the duty of transporting school children and personnel, and facilities to transport them, provided schoolbus transportation at any time after November 25, 1973, but before November 26, 1974.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Not later than January 1, 1995, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit to Congress a report on purchases from foreign entities waived under paragraph (2) of this subsection in the fiscal years ending September 30, 1992, and September 30, 1993. The report shall indicate the dollar value of items for which waivers were granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Application of Section</cap-smallcap> 135 <cap-smallcap>of Title</cap-smallcap> 23.&mdash;The planning and programming requirements of section 135 of title 23 apply to a grant made under sections 5307&ndash;5311 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) through an appropriate screening or survey process, that there is no interest in acquiring the asset for Government use if the asset is a facility or land.</p>

The reference to subsection (c)(2) is omitted as obsolete because section 201(d)(1) of the Housing and Community Development Technical Amendments Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;479, 98 Stat. 2228) repealed 12:1749a(c)(2).

<p class="note-body">Subsection (i) is substituted for section 1(a)(1) (related to authority and functions reserved to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1968 to eliminate unnecessary words. The reference to 49 App.:1602(c)(1) is translated as a reference to 49 App.:1602(e)(1) because section 2(1) of the Urban Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970 (Public Law 91&ndash;453, 84 Stat. 962) redesignated subsection (c) as subsection (e). The references to 49 App.:1603(a) (1st sentence), 1604, and 1607c(b) and former 49 App.:1607a are omitted as obsolete because of section 103(a) of the National Mass Transportation Act of 1974 (Public Law 93&ndash;503, 88 Stat. 1567) and sections 303(b), 305(a), and 307 of the Federal Public Transportation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;599, 92 Stat. 2737, 2743, 2747).
