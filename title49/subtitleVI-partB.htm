<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may not discharge an employee, or discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding pay, terms, or privileges of employment, because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employee, or another person at the employee's request, has filed a complaint or begun a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety regulation, standard, or order, or has testified or will testify in such a proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employee refuses to operate a vehicle because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the operation violates a regulation, standard, or order of the United States related to commercial motor vehicle safety or health; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle's unsafe condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection, an employee's apprehension of serious injury is reasonable only if a reasonable individual in the circumstances then confronting the employee would conclude that the unsafe condition establishes a real danger of accident, injury, or serious impairment to health. To qualify for protection, the employee must have sought from the employer, and been unable to obtain, correction of the unsafe condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Filing Complaints and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An employee alleging discharge, discipline, or discrimination in violation of subsection (a) of this section, or another person at the employee's request, may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor not later than 180 days after the alleged violation occurred. On receiving the complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person alleged to have committed the violation of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than 60 days after receiving a complaint, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation, decide whether it is reasonable to believe the complaint has merit, and notify the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation of the findings. If the Secretary decides it is reasonable to believe a violation occurred, the Secretary shall include with the decision findings and a preliminary order for the relief provided under paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 30 days after the notice under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of objections does not stay a reinstatement ordered in the preliminary order. If a hearing is not requested within the 30 days, the preliminary order is final and not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A hearing shall be conducted expeditiously. Not later than 120 days after the end of the hearing, the Secretary shall issue a final order. Before the final order is issued, the proceeding may be ended by a settlement agreement made by the Secretary, the complainant, and the person alleged to have committed the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the Secretary decides, on the basis of a complaint, a person violated subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall order the person to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) take affirmative action to abate the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) reinstate the complainant to the former position with the same pay and terms and privileges of employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) pay compensatory damages, including back pay.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary issues an order under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the complainant requests, the Secretary may assess against the person against whom the order is issued the costs (including attorney's fees) reasonably incurred by the complainant in bringing the complaint. The Secretary shall determine the costs that reasonably were incurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Review and Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person adversely affected by an order issued after a hearing under subsection (b) of this section may file a petition for review, not later than 60 days after the order is issued, in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the violation occurred or the person resided on the date of the violation. The review shall be heard and decided expeditiously. An order of the Secretary subject to review under this subsection is not subject to judicial review in a criminal or other civil proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Enforce</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person fails to comply with an order issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall bring a civil action to enforce the order in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the violation occurred.</p>

Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and those classes of qualifying Federal-aid Primary System highways designated by the Secretary of Transportation under section 31111(e) of this title, of any commercial motor vehicle combination (except a vehicle or load that cannot be dismantled easily or divided easily and that has been issued a special permit under applicable State law) with more than one property-carrying unit (not including the truck tractor) whose property-carrying units are more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the maximum combination trailer, semitrailer, or other type of length limitation allowed by law or regulation of that State before June 2, 1991; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the length of the property-carrying units of those commercial motor vehicle combinations, by specific configuration, in actual, lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) in that State before June 2, 1991.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Special Rules for Wyoming, Ohio, Alaska, and Iowa</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to the vehicles allowed under subsection (b) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Wyoming may allow the operation of additional vehicle configurations not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but authorized by State law not later than November 3, 1992, if the vehicle configurations comply with the single axle, tandem axle, and bridge formula limits in section 127(a) of title 23 and are not more than 117,000 pounds gross vehicle weight;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Ohio may allow the operation of commercial motor vehicle combinations with 3 property-carrying units of 28.5 feet each (not including the truck tractor) not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, to be operated in Ohio on the 1-mile segment of Ohio State Route 7 that begins at and is south of exit 16 of the Ohio Turnpike;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Iowa may allow the operation on Interstate Route 29 between Sioux City, Iowa, and the border between Iowa and South Dakota or on Interstate Route 129 between Sioux City, Iowa, and the border between Iowa and Nebraska of commercial motor vehicle combinations with trailer length, semitrailer length, and property-carrying unit length allowed by law or regulation and in actual lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continued seasonal operation) in South Dakota or Nebraska, respectively, before June 2, 1991.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Additional Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A commercial motor vehicle combination whose operation in a State is not prohibited under subsections (b) and (c) of this section may continue to operate in the State on highways described in subsection (b) only if at least in compliance with all State laws, regulations, limitations, and conditions, including routing-specific and configuration-specific designations and all other restrictions in force in the State on June 1, 1991. However, subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (g)(2) of this section, the State may make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency nature to route designations and vehicle operating restrictions in effect on June 1, 1991, for specific safety purposes and road construction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not prevent a State from further restricting in any way or prohibiting the operation of any commercial motor vehicle combination subject to this section, except that a restriction or prohibition shall be consistent with this section and sections 31113(a) and (b) and 31114 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State making a minor adjustment of a temporary and emergency nature as authorized by paragraph (1) of this subsection or further restricting or prohibiting the operation of a commercial motor vehicle combination as authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection shall advise the Secretary not later than 30 days after the action.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, a State (except Hawaii) may not prescribe or enforce a regulation of commerce that imposes a vehicle width limitation of more or less than 102 inches on a commercial motor vehicle operating on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways (except a segment exempted under subsection (e) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a qualifying Federal-aid highway designated by the Secretary of Transportation, with traffic lanes designed to be at least 12 feet wide; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a qualifying Federal-aid Primary System highway designated by the Secretary if the Secretary decides the designation is consistent with highway safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a State may continue to enforce a regulation of commerce in effect on April 6, 1983, that applies to a commercial motor vehicle of more than 102 inches in width, until the date on which the State prescribes a regulation of commerce that complies with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A Federal-aid highway (except an interstate highway) not designated under this subsection on June 5, 1984, may be designated under this subsection only with the agreement of the chief executive officer of the State in which the highway is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of Safety and Energy Conservation Devices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Width calculated under this section does not include a safety or energy conservation device the Secretary decides is necessary for safe and efficient operation of a commercial motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Special Use Permits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may grant a special use permit to a commercial motor vehicle that is more than 102 inches in width.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Consistent with this section, a State may enforce a commercial motor vehicle width limitation of 102 inches on a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways (except a segment exempted under subsection (e) of this section) or other qualifying Federal-aid highway designated by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the chief executive officer of a State, after consulting under paragraph (2) of this subsection, decides a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is not capable of safely accommodating a commercial motor vehicle having the width provided in subsection (a) of this section, the chief executive officer may notify the Secretary of that decision and request the Secretary to exempt that segment from subsection (a) to allow the State to impose a width limitation of less than 102 inches for a vehicle (except a bus) on that segment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before making a decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the chief executive officer shall consult with units of local government in the State in which the segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is located and with the chief executive officer of any adjacent State that may be directly affected by the exemption. As part of the consultations, consideration shall be given to any potential alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located and can safely accommodate a commercial motor vehicle having the width provided for in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A chief executive officer's notification under this subsection must include specific evidence of safety problems supporting the officer's decision and the results of consultations about alternative routes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the Secretary decides, on request of a chief executive officer or on the Secretary's own initiative, a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is not capable of safely accommodating a commercial motor vehicle having a width provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall exempt the segment from subsection (a) to allow the State to impose a width limitation of less than 102 inches for a vehicle (except a bus) on that segment. Before making a decision under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider any possible alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make a decision about a specific segment not later than 120 days after the date of receipt of notification from a chief executive officer under paragraph (1) of this subsection or the date on which the Secretary initiates action under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, whichever is applicable. If the Secretary finds the decision will not be made in time, the Secretary immediately shall notify Congress, giving the reasons for the delay, information about the resources assigned, and the projected date for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Before making a decision, the Secretary shall give an interested person notice and an opportunity for comment. If the Secretary exempts a segment under this subsection before <!-- PDFPage:397 -->the final regulations under subsection (a) of this section are prescribed, the Secretary shall include the exemption as part of the final regulations. If the Secretary exempts the segment after the final regulations are prescribed, the Secretary shall publish the exemption as an amendment to the final regulations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Safety Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to section 30103(a) of this title, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety. The regulations shall prescribe minimum safety standards for commercial motor vehicles. At a minimum, the regulations shall ensure that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the responsibilities imposed on operators of commercial motor vehicles do not impair their ability to operate the vehicles safely;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the physical condition of operators of commercial motor vehicles is adequate to enable them to operate the vehicles safely; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the operation of commercial motor vehicles does not have a deleterious effect on the physical condition of the operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Eliminating and Amending Existing Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not eliminate or amend an existing motor carrier safety regulation related only to the maintenance, equipment, loading, or operation (including routing) of vehicles carrying material found to be hazardous under section 5103 of this title until an equivalent or more stringent regulation has been prescribed under section 5103.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures and Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A regulation under this section shall be prescribed under section 553 of title 5 (without regard to sections 556 and 557 of title 5).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Encouragement of advanced technology</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall encourage participants in the program to use such advanced technologies as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Approval factors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In approving applicants for participation in the program, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) ensure that the participants represent a broad cross-section of fleet size and drivers of eligible vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) ensure participation by qualified applicants, except to the extent limited by resources of the Secretary that are necessary to permit effective monitoring under subparagraph (G).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Modifications to reflect changes in regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If there is a material change in the regulations prescribed under this section or section 504 or 31502, the Secretary shall require each participant in the program to modify the safety management controls applicable to such participant, and the agreement provided for in subparagraph (A)(ii), to the extent necessary to reflect the material change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary and participants in the program shall monitor periodically the safety of vehicles and drivers subject to the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) <cap-smallcap>Termination of participation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A participant shall participate in the program until&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) <cap-smallcap>Guidelines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than the 270th day following the date of the enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for comment, shall establish criteria and define any terms necessary for implementing the program consistent with this section.

The review shall focus on the appropriate level of safety that is in the public interest and the paperwork and regulatory burdens of such regulations as the regulations apply to employers and employees that use such vehicles. The Secretary shall complete the review by the last day of the 3-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this paragraph. Upon completion of the review, the Secretary shall, after notice and an opportunity for public comment, grant such exemptions or modify or repeal existing regulations to the extent appropriate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Inspection of Safety Equipment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the instruction of an authorized enforcement official of a State or of the United States Government, a commercial motor vehicle is required to pass an inspection of all safety equipment required under part 393 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inspection of Vehicles and Record Retention</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations on Government standards for inspection of commercial motor vehicles and retention by employers of records of an inspection. The standards shall provide for annual or more frequent inspections of a commercial motor vehicle unless the Secretary finds that another inspection system is as effective as an annual or more frequent inspection system. Regulations prescribed under this subsection are deemed to be regulations prescribed under section 31136 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, this subchapter and section 31102 of this title do not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prevent a State or voluntary group of States from imposing more stringent standards for use in their own periodic roadside inspection programs of commercial motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prevent a State from enforcing a program for inspection of commercial motor vehicles that the Secretary decides is as effective as the Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) prevent a State from enforcing a program for inspection of commercial motor vehicles that meets the requirements for membership in the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, as those requirements were in effect on October 30, 1984; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) require a State that is enforcing a program described in clause (B) or (C) of this paragraph to enforce a Government standard prescribed under subsection (b) of this section or to adopt a provision on inspection of commercial motor vehicles in addition to that program to comply with the Government standards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section shall preempt a program of a State described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection as the program applies to the inspection of commercial motor vehicles in that State. The State may not enforce the program if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decides, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that the State is not enforcing the program in a way that achieves the objectives of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after making a decision under clause (A) of this paragraph, provides the State with a 6-month period to improve the enforcement of the program to achieve the objectives of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Inspection To Be Accepted as Adequate in All States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A periodic inspection of a commercial motor vehicle under the Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section or a program described in subsection (c)(1)(B) or (C) of this section that is being enforced shall be recognized as adequate in every State for the period of the inspection. This subsection does not prohibit a State from making random inspections of commercial motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Government Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section may not be enforced as the standards apply to the inspection of commercial motor vehicles in a State enforcing a program described in subsection (c)(1)(B) or (C) of this section if the Secretary decides that it is in the public interest and consistent with public safety for the Government standards not to be enforced as they apply to that inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application of State Regulations to Government-Leased Vehicles and Operators</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State receiving financial assistance under section 31102 of this title in a fiscal year may enforce in that fiscal year a regulation on commercial motor vehicle safety adopted by the State as the regulation applies to commercial motor vehicles and operators leased to the Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Testing Program for Operators of Commercial Motor Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In the interest of commercial motor vehicle safety, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations that establish a program requiring motor carriers to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of <!-- PDFPage:415 -->operators of commercial motor vehicles for the use of a controlled substance in violation of law or a United States Government regulation and to conduct reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of such operators for the use of alcohol in violation of law or a United States Government regulation. The regulations shall permit such motor carriers to conduct preemployment testing of such employees for the use of alcohol.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When the Secretary of Transportation considers it appropriate in the interest of safety, the Secretary may prescribe regulations for conducting periodic recurring testing of operators of commercial motor vehicles for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall require that post-accident testing of an operator of a commercial motor vehicle be conducted when loss of human life occurs in an accident involving a commercial motor vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may require that post-accident testing of such an operator be conducted when bodily injury or significant property damage occurs in any other serious accident involving a commercial motor vehicle.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require that a laboratory involved in testing under this section have the capability and facility, at the laboratory, of performing screening and confirmation tests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that any test indicating the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable of providing quantitative information about alcohol or a controlled substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the confidentiality of test results and medical information (except information about alcohol or a controlled substance) of employees, except that this clause does not prevent the use of test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) ensure that employees are selected for tests by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that no employee is harassed by being treated differently from other employees in similar circumstances.</p>

The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which those operators shall be required to participate in a program. This section does not prevent a motor carrier from establishing a program under this section in cooperation with another motor carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Sanctions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall decide on appropriate sanctions for a commercial motor vehicle operator who is found, based on tests conducted and confirmed under this section, to have used alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation but who is not under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance as provided in this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Effect on State and Local Government Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State or local government may not prescribe or continue in effect a law, regulation, standard, or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this section. However, a regulation prescribed under this section may not be construed to preempt a State criminal law that imposes sanctions for <!-- PDFPage:416 -->reckless conduct leading to loss of life, injury, or damage to property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>International Obligations and Foreign Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In prescribing regulations under this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
