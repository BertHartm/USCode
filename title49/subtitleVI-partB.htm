<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may not discharge an employee, or discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding pay, terms, or privileges of employment, because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the employee, or another person at the employee's request, has filed a complaint or begun a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security regulation, standard, or order, or has testified or will testify in such a proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the person perceives that the employee has filed or is about to file a complaint or has begun or is about to begin a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security regulation, standard, or order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employee refuses to operate a vehicle because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the operation violates a regulation, standard, or order of the United States related to commercial motor vehicle safety, health, or security; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle's hazardous safety or security condition;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the employee accurately reports hours on duty pursuant to chapter 315;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the employee cooperates, or the person perceives that the employee is about to cooperate, with a safety or security investigation by the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the National Transportation Safety Board; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the employee furnishes, or the person perceives that the employee is or is about to furnish, information to the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the National Transportation Safety Board, or any Federal, State, or local regulatory or law enforcement agency as to the facts relating to any accident or incident resulting in injury or death to an individual or damage to property occurring in connection with commercial motor vehicle transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection, an employee's apprehension of serious injury is reasonable only if a reasonable individual in the circumstances then confronting the employee would conclude that the hazardous safety or security condition establishes a real danger of accident, injury, or serious impairment to health. To qualify for protection, the employee must have sought from the employer, and been unable to obtain, correction of the hazardous safety or security condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Filing Complaints and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An employee alleging discharge, discipline, or discrimination in violation of subsection (a) of this section, or another person at the employee's request, may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor not later than 180 days after the alleged violation occurred. All complaints initiated under this section shall be governed by the legal burdens of proof set forth in section 42121(b). On receiving the complaint, the Secretary of Labor shall notify, in writing, the person alleged to have committed the violation of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:541 --><p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than 60 days after receiving a complaint, the Secretary of Labor shall conduct an investigation, decide whether it is reasonable to believe the complaint has merit, and notify, in writing, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation of the findings. If the Secretary of Labor decides it is reasonable to believe a violation occurred, the Secretary of Labor shall include with the decision findings and a preliminary order for the relief provided under paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 30 days after the notice under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of objections does not stay a reinstatement ordered in the preliminary order. If a hearing is not requested within the 30 days, the preliminary order is final and not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A hearing shall be conducted expeditiously. Not later than 120 days after the end of the hearing, the Secretary of Labor shall issue a final order.

The Secretary of Labor shall determine the costs that reasonably were incurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Relief in any action under subsection (b) may include punitive damages in an amount not to exceed $250,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>De Novo Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With respect to a complaint under paragraph (1),<sup><a href="#31105_1_target" name="31105_1">1</a></sup> if the Secretary of Labor has not issued a final decision within 210 days after the filing of the complaint and if the delay is not due to the bad faith of the employee, the employee may bring an original action at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy, and which action shall, at the request of either party to such action, be tried by the court with a jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Review and Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person adversely affected by an order issued after a hearing under subsection (b) of this section may file a petition for review, not later than 60 days after the order is issued, in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the violation occurred or the person resided on the date of the violation.

<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Rights Retained by Employee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be deemed to diminish the rights, privileges, or remedies of any employee under any Federal or State law or under any collective bargaining agreement. The rights and remedies in this section may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of Identity.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, or with the written consent of the employee, the Secretary of Transportation or the Secretary of Homeland Security may not disclose the name of an employee who has provided information about an alleged violation of this part, or a regulation prescribed or order issued under any of those provisions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary of Transportation or the Secretary of Homeland Security shall disclose to the Attorney General the name of an employee described in paragraph (1) of this subsection if the matter is referred to the Attorney General for enforcement.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of process</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish through regulations, after an opportunity for notice and comment, a process by which any person may report to the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding motor carrier vehicle security problems, deficiencies, or vulnerabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, a State (except Hawaii) may not prescribe or enforce a regulation of commerce that imposes a vehicle width limitation of more or less than 102 inches on a commercial motor vehicle operating on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways (except a segment exempted under subsection (e) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a qualifying Federal-aid highway designated by the Secretary of Transportation, with traffic lanes designed to be at least 12 feet wide; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a qualifying Federal-aid Primary System highway designated by the Secretary if the Secretary decides the designation is consistent with highway safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a State may continue to enforce a regulation of commerce in effect on April 6, 1983, that applies to a commercial motor vehicle of more than 102 inches in width, until the date on which the State prescribes a regulation of commerce that complies with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A Federal-aid highway (except an interstate highway) not designated under this subsection on June 5, 1984, may be designated under this subsection only with the agreement of the chief executive officer of the State in which the highway is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of Safety and Energy Conservation Devices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Width calculated under this section does not include a safety or energy conservation device the Secretary decides is necessary for safe and efficient operation of a commercial motor vehicle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the chief executive officer of a State, after consulting under paragraph (2) of this subsection, decides a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is not capable of safely accommodating a commercial motor vehicle having the width provided in subsection (a) of this <!-- PDFPage:551 -->section, the chief executive officer may notify the Secretary of that decision and request the Secretary to exempt that segment from subsection (a) to allow the State to impose a width limitation of less than 102 inches for a vehicle (except a bus) on that segment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before making a decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the chief executive officer shall consult with units of local government in the State in which the segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is located and with the chief executive officer of any adjacent State that may be directly affected by the exemption. As part of the consultations, consideration shall be given to any potential alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located and can safely accommodate a commercial motor vehicle having the width provided for in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A chief executive officer's notification under this subsection must include specific evidence of safety problems supporting the officer's decision and the results of consultations about alternative routes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the Secretary decides, on request of a chief executive officer or on the Secretary's own initiative, a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is not capable of safely accommodating a commercial motor vehicle having a width provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall exempt the segment from subsection (a) to allow the State to impose a width limitation of less than 102 inches for a vehicle (except a bus) on that segment. Before making a decision under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider any possible alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make a decision about a specific segment not later than 120 days after the date of receipt of notification from a chief executive officer under paragraph (1) of this subsection or the date on which the Secretary initiates action under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, whichever is applicable. If the Secretary finds the decision will not be made in time, the Secretary immediately shall notify Congress, giving the reasons for the delay, information about the resources assigned, and the projected date for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Before making a decision, the Secretary shall give an interested person notice and an opportunity for comment. If the Secretary exempts a segment under this subsection before the final regulations under subsection (a) of this section are prescribed, the Secretary shall include the exemption as part of the final regulations. If the Secretary exempts the segment after the final regulations are prescribed, the Secretary shall publish the exemption as an amendment to the final regulations.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Inspection of Safety Equipment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the instruction of an authorized enforcement official of a State or of the United States Government, a commercial motor vehicle is required to pass an inspection of all safety equipment required under the regulations issued under section 31136.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inspection of Vehicles and Record Retention</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations on Government standards for inspection of commercial motor vehicles and retention by employers of records of an inspection. The standards shall provide for annual or more frequent inspections of a commercial motor vehicle unless the Secretary finds that another inspection system is as effective as an annual or more frequent inspection system. Regulations prescribed under this subsection are deemed to be regulations prescribed under section 31136 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, this subchapter and section 31102 of this title do not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prevent a State or voluntary group of States from imposing more stringent standards for use in their own periodic roadside inspection programs of commercial motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prevent a State from enforcing a program for inspection of commercial motor vehicles that the Secretary decides is as effective as the Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) prevent a State from participating in the activities of a voluntary group of States enforcing a program for inspection of commercial motor vehicles; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) require a State that is enforcing a program described in clause (B) or (C) of this paragraph to enforce a Government standard prescribed under subsection (b) of this section or to adopt a provision on inspection of commercial motor vehicles in addition to that program to comply with the Government standards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section shall preempt a program of a State described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection as the program applies to the inspection of commercial motor vehicles in that State. The State may not enforce the program if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decides, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that the State is not enforcing the program in a way that achieves the objectives of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after making a decision under clause (A) of this paragraph, provides the State with a 6-month period to improve the enforcement of the program to achieve the objectives of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Inspection To Be Accepted as Adequate in All States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A periodic inspection of a commercial motor vehicle under the Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section or a program described in subsection (c)(1)(B) or (C) of this section that is being enforced shall be recognized as adequate in every State for the period of the inspection. This subsection does not prohibit a State from making random inspections of commercial motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Government Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government standards prescribed under subsection (b) of this section may not be enforced as the standards apply to the inspection of commercial motor vehicles in a State enforcing a program described in subsection (c)(1)(B) or (C) of this section if the Secretary decides that it is in the public interest and consistent with public safety for the Government standards not to be enforced as they apply to that inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application of State Regulations to Government-Leased Vehicles and Operators</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State receiving financial assistance under section 31102 of this title in a fiscal year may enforce in that fiscal year a regulation on commercial motor vehicle safety adopted by the State as the regulation applies to commercial motor vehicles and operators leased to the Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Testing Program for Operators of Commercial Motor Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In the interest of commercial motor vehicle safety, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations that establish a program requiring motor carriers to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of operators of commercial motor vehicles for the use of a controlled substance in violation of law or a United States Government regulation and to conduct reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of such operators for the use of alcohol in violation of law or a United States Government regulation. The regulations shall permit such motor carriers to conduct preemployment testing of such employees for the use of alcohol.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When the Secretary of Transportation considers it appropriate in the interest of safety, the Secretary may prescribe regulations for conducting periodic recurring testing of operators of commercial motor vehicles for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:576 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall require that post-accident testing of an operator of a commercial motor vehicle be conducted when loss of human life occurs in an accident involving a commercial motor vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may require that post-accident testing of such an operator be conducted when bodily injury or significant property damage occurs in any other serious accident involving a commercial motor vehicle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Testing and Laboratory Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall develop requirements that shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote, to the maximum extent practicable, individual privacy in the collection of specimens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for laboratories and testing procedures for controlled substances, incorporate the Department of Health and Human Services scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11, 1988, and any amendments to those guidelines, including mandatory guidelines establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comprehensive standards for every aspect of laboratory controlled substances testing and laboratory procedures to be applied in carrying out this section, including standards requiring the use of the best available technology to ensure the complete reliability and accuracy of controlled substances tests and strict procedures governing the chain of custody of specimens collected for controlled substances testing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the minimum list of controlled substances for which individuals may be tested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) appropriate standards and procedures for periodic review of laboratories and criteria for certification and revocation of certification of laboratories to perform controlled substances testing in carrying out this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require that a laboratory involved in testing under this section have the capability and facility, at the laboratory, of performing screening and confirmation tests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that any test indicating the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable of providing quantitative information about alcohol or a controlled substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the confidentiality of test results and medical information (except information about alcohol or a controlled substance) of employees, except that this clause does not prevent the use of test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) ensure that employees are selected for tests by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that no employee is harassed by being treated differently from other employees in similar circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Testing as Part of Medical Examination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may provide that testing under subsection (a) of this section for operators subject to subpart E of part 391 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, be conducted as part of the medical examination required under that subpart.</p>

The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which those operators shall be required to participate in a program. This section does not prevent a motor carrier from establishing a program under this section in cooperation with another motor carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Sanctions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall decide on appropriate sanctions for a commercial motor vehicle operator who is found, based on tests conducted and confirmed under this section, to have used alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation but who is not under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance as provided in this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Effect on State and Local Government Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State or local government may not prescribe or continue in effect a law, regulation, standard, or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this section. However, a regulation prescribed under this section may not be construed to preempt a State criminal law that imposes sanctions for reckless conduct leading to loss of life, injury, or damage to property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>International Obligations and Foreign Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In prescribing regulations under this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) An analysis of the safety impacts the requested exemption may cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The specific countermeasures the person would undertake to ensure an equivalent or greater level of safety than would be achieved absent the requested exemption.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Notice and comment.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Upon receipt of a request</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon receipt of an exemption request, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice explaining the request that has been filed and shall give the public an opportunity to inspect the safety analysis and any other relevant information known to the Secretary and to comment on the request.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Applications to be dealt with promptly</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall grant or deny an exemption request after a thorough review of its safety implications, but in no case later than 180 days after the filing date of such request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Terms and conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish terms and conditions for each exemption to ensure that it will likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption. The Secretary shall monitor the implementation of the exemption to ensure compliance with its terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Notification of state compliance and enforcement personnel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before granting a request for exemption, the Secretary shall notify State safety compliance and enforcement personnel, including roadside inspectors, and the public that a person will be operating pursuant to an exemption and any terms and conditions that will apply to the exemption.</p>

The Secretary shall include, at a minimum, the following elements in each pilot program plan:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A scheduled life of each pilot program of not more than 3 years.</p>

<p class="note-body">Throughout the chapter, the words &ldquo;Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Interstate Commerce Commission&rdquo; because 49:1655(e)(6)(B)&ndash;(D) transferred the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the provisions restated in this chapter to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is included to maintain the jurisdictional scope of the source provisions from which subsections (b) and (c) of the revised section are taken. Subsections (b) and (c) are based on 49:304 which, as part of 49:ch. 8, is now restated as subchapter II of chapter 105 of the revised title.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;as provided in this chapter&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The term &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;common carriers by motor vehicle&rdquo; and &ldquo;contract carriers by motor vehicle&rdquo; because they are inclusive.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;establish&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;for a total distance of&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;more than&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;line&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;possession of the United States&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;a foreign country&rdquo; and &ldquo;the District of Columbia&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because a carrier crossing the boundary of a foreign country or the District of Columbia into or from the United States would necessarily cross the boundary of a State and be covered by the provision related to a State.</p>
