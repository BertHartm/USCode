<!-- PDFPage:823 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that the Administrator requires to have a certificate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if the Administrator finds, after investigation, that the person properly and adequately is equipped and able to operate safely under this part and regulations and standards prescribed under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Terms</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An airport operating certificate issued under this section shall contain terms necessary to ensure safety in air transportation. Unless the Administrator decides that it is not in the public interest, the terms shall include conditions related to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) operating and maintaining adequate safety equipment, including firefighting and rescue equipment capable of rapid access to any part of the airport used for landing, takeoff, or surface maneuvering of an aircraft; and</p>
