<p class="note-body">Appropriate cross references to those sections of the revised title to which 49:1(7) (1st sentence) has been distributed are added for clarity, and the words &ldquo;violating this provision&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and for each offense on conviction&rdquo; are omitted as surplus and as unnecessary in view of title 18. The words &ldquo;shall pay to the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;individual&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;person&rdquo; for consistency when referring to a human being. The word &ldquo;fined&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; for consistency and to distinguish from a civil penalty. The words &ldquo;free ticket&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;free ticket, free pass&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;interstate&rdquo; is omitted in view of the restatement. The last sentence of 49:1(7) is omitted as unnecessary.</p>
