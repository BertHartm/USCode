<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Government is entitled to the nonexclusive use, without charge, of the landing area of an airport at which the property is located.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) contribute a reasonable share, consistent with the Government's use, of the cost of maintaining and operating the landing area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay for damages caused by its use of the landing area if its use of the landing area is substantial.</p>
