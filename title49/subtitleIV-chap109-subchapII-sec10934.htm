<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be responsible for all acts or omissions of any of its agents which relate to the performance of household goods transportation services (including accessorial or terminal services) subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and which are within the actual or apparent authority of the agent from the carrier or which are ratified by the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall use due diligence and reasonable care in selecting and maintaining agents who are sufficiently knowledgeable, fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) and to fulfill the obligations imposed upon them by this subtitle and by such carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Whenever the Commission has reason to believe from a complaint or investigation that an agent providing household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) under the authority of a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title has violated section 11901(k) or 11917 of this title or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), it may issue to such agent a complaint stating the charges and containing notice of the time and place of a hearing which shall be held no later than 60 days after service of the complaint to such agent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such agent shall have the right to appear at such hearing and rebut the charges contained in the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If such person does not appear at the hearing or if the Commission finds that the agent has violated section 11901(k) or 11917 of this title or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), it may issue an order to compel <!-- PDFPage:316 -->compliance with the requirement that the agent be fit, willing, and able. Thereafter, the Commission may issue an order to limit, condition, or prohibit such agent from any involvement in the transportation or provision of services incidental to the transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title if, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, it finds that such agent, within a reasonable time after the date of issuance of a compliance order under this section, but in no event less than 30 days after such date of issuance, has willfully failed to comply with such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon filing of a petition with the Commission by an agent who is the subject of an order issued pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection and after notice, a hearing shall be held with an opportunity to be heard. At such hearing, a determination shall be made whether the order issued pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection should be rescinded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any agent adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Commission issued under this subsection may seek relief in the appropriate United States court of appeals as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to discussions or agreements between a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and its agents (whether or not an agent is also a carrier) related solely to (1) rates for the transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier, (2) accessorial, terminal, storage, or other charges for services incidental to the transportation of household goods transported under the authority of the principal carrier, (3) allowances relating to transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier, and (4) ownership of a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title by an agent or membership on the board of directors of any such motor common carrier by an agent.</p>
