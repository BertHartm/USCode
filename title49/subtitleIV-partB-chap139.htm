<h4 class="note-head">Limited Modification to Moratorium on Issuance of Certificates or Permits With Respect to Mexico</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 6, 1993, 58 F.R. 27647, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 [Pub. L. 97&ndash;261, see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)] imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country. The Act [Pub. L. 97&ndash;261, see Tables for classification] authorized the President to remove the moratorium in whole or in part for any country or political subdivision thereof upon determining that such action is in the national interest. Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am pleased that an agreement between the United States and Mexico has been concluded to ensure fair and reciprocal treatment for charter and tour bus interests on both sides of the border. The agreement reached, however, does not allow for full access to cross-border and domestic markets. Therefore, the moratorium must reflect the conditions under which operating authority may be issued to Mexican charter and tour companies under the agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(2)(A)], I hereby make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or special operations, in foreign commerce, in round trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States pursuant to the following restrictions:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The Mexican motor carrier can conduct cross-border charter or special service in the United States only when the international tour or charter begins in Mexico;</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Tickets or tour packages for such operations cannot be sold in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The terms of the grants of authority given to Mexican motor carriers will be limited by the life of the agreement with Mexico covering reciprocal cross-border charter and special operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This action applies only to international charter and tour operations, does not allow for point-to-point service within the United States, and does not authorize companies to conduct cross-border regular route service. This action preserves the status quo with respect to Mexican trucking companies and Mexican companies engaged in regular route service, and will maintain the moratorium on those operations through September 25, 1994, unless earlier revoked or modified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, you are directed to notify the Congress today on my behalf that, effective 60 days hence, the moratorium will no longer be in effect for Mexican charter and tour bus companies subject to the above stated conditions. Because of this action, the Interstate Commerce Commission will then accept and process expeditiously all applications for operating authority from Mexican owned, controlled, or domiciled charter and tour bus firms. I should note that applications in Mexico by United States charter and tour bus firms will be similarly treated.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 [Pub. L. 97&ndash;261, see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)] imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by, persons of a contiguous foreign country. The Act [Pub. L. 97&ndash;261, see Tables for classification] authorized the President to remove the moratorium in whole or in part for any country or political subdivision thereof upon determining that such action is in the national interest. Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a foreign contiguous country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">As set forth in the Statement of Administrative Action regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that I submitted to the Congress on November 3, 1993, the moratorium with respect to Mexico will be lifted in phases to coincide with the schedule of liberalization in the relevant provisions of the NAFTA. The NAFTA specifically states that the moratorium will not apply to the provision of cross-border charter or tour bus services as of the date of entry into force of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">This is to give public notice that, pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(2)(A)], on November 3, 1993, I gave the Congress notice of my intention to make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by, persons of Mexico. This modification will take effect on January 1, 1994, the 60th day after my notice to the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican <!-- PDFPage:270 -->motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or tour bus operations, in foreign commerce, in round-trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">This action applies only to international charter or tour bus operations, does not allow for point-to-point bus service within the United States, and does not authorize companies to conduct cross-border regular route bus service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Effective January 1, 1994, the Interstate Commerce Commission will begin to accept and process expeditiously all applications for operating authority from Mexican owned, controlled, or domiciled charter and tour bus firms.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Motor Carrier Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Liability insurance requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may register a motor carrier under section 13902 only if the registrant files with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary, in an amount not less than such amount as the Secretary prescribes pursuant to, or as is required by, sections 31138 and 31139, and the laws of the State or States in which the registrant is operating, to the extent applicable. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the registrant for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles, or for loss or damage to property (except property referred to in paragraph (3) of this subsection), or both. A registration remains in effect only as long as the registrant continues to satisfy the security requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Agency requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A motor carrier shall comply with the requirements of sec<!-- PDFPage:272 -->tions 13303 and 13304. To protect the public, the Secretary may require any such motor carrier to file the type of security that a motor carrier is required to file under paragraph (1) of this subsection. This paragraph only applies to a foreign motor private carrier and foreign motor carrier operating in the United States to the extent that such carrier is providing transportation between places in a foreign country or between a place in one foreign country and a place in another foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Transportation insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may require a registered motor carrier to file with the Secretary a type of security sufficient to pay a shipper or consignee for damage to property of the shipper or consignee placed in the possession of the motor carrier as the result of transportation provided under this part. A carrier required by law to pay a shipper or consignee for loss, damage, or default for which a connecting motor carrier is responsible is subrogated, to the extent of the amount paid, to the rights of the shipper or consignee under any such security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Broker Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may register a person as a broker under section 13904 only if the person files with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary to ensure that the transportation for which a broker arranges is provided. The registration remains in effect only as long as the broker continues to satisfy the security requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Freight Forwarder Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Liability insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may register a person as a freight forwarder under section 13903 of this title only if the person files with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the freight forwarder for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual, or loss of, or damage to, property (other than property referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection), resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles by or under the direction and control of the freight forwarder when providing transfer, collection, or delivery service under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Freight forwarder insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may require a registered freight forwarder to file with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for loss of, or damage to, property for which the freight forwarder provides service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Effective period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The freight forwarder's registration remains in effect only as long as the freight forwarder continues to satisfy the security requirements of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Type of Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may determine the type and amount of security filed under this section. A motor carrier may submit proof of qualifications as a self-insurer to satisfy the security requirements of this section. The Secretary shall adopt regulations governing the standards for approval as a self-insurer. Motor carriers which have been granted authority to self-insure as of January 1, 1996, shall retain that authority unless, for good cause shown and after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds that the authority must be revoked.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Notice of Cancellation of Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue regulations requiring the submission to the Secretary of notices of insurance cancellation sufficiently in advance of actual cancellation so as to enable the Secretary to promptly revoke the registration of any carrier or broker after the effective date of the cancellation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Form of Endorsement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall also prescribe the appropriate form of endorsement to be appended to policies of insurance and surety bonds which will subject the insurance policy or surety bond to the full security limits of the coverage required under this section.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Carriers Responsible for Agents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each motor carrier providing transportation of household goods shall be responsible for all acts or omissions of any of its agents which relate to the performance of household goods transportation services (including accessorial or terminal services) and which are within the actual or apparent authority of the agent from the carrier or which are ratified by the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Standard for Selecting Agents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each motor carrier providing transportation of household goods shall use due diligence and reason<!-- PDFPage:273 -->able care in selecting and maintaining agents who are sufficiently knowledgeable, fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) and to fulfill the obligations imposed upon them by this part and by such carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Complaint</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe from a complaint or investigation that an agent providing household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) under the authority of a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods has violated section 14901(e) or 14912 or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), the Secretary may issue to such agent a complaint stating the charges and containing notice of the time and place of a hearing which shall be held no later than 60 days after service of the complaint to such agent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Right to defend</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agent shall have the right to appear at such hearing and rebut the charges contained in the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the agent does not appear at the hearing or if the Secretary finds that the agent has violated section 14901(e) or 14912 or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), the Secretary may issue an order to compel compliance with the requirement that the agent be fit, willing, and able. Thereafter, the Secretary may issue an order to limit, condition, or prohibit such agent from any involvement in the transportation or provision of services incidental to the transportation of household goods if, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds that such agent, within a reasonable time after the date of issuance of a compliance order under this section, but in no event less than 30 days after such date of issuance, has willfully failed to comply with such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon filing of a petition with the Secretary by an agent who is the subject of an order issued pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection and after notice, a hearing shall be held with an opportunity to be heard. At such hearing, a determination shall be made whether the order issued pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection should be rescinded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Court review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any agent adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Secretary issued under this subsection may seek relief in the appropriate United States court of appeals as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Applicability of Antitrust Laws.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to discussions or agreements between a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods and its agents (whether or not an agent is also a carrier) related solely to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) rates for the transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) accessorial, terminal, storage, or other charges for services incidental to the transportation of household goods transported under the authority of the principal carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) allowances relating to transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ownership of a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods by an agent or membership on the board of directors of any such motor carrier by an agent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Board review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board, upon its own initiative or request, shall review any activities undertaken under paragraph (1) and shall modify or terminate the activity if necessary to protect the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Household goods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;household goods&rdquo; has the meaning such term had under section 10102(11) of this title, as in effect on December 31, 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; means transportation that would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, as in effect on December 31, 1995, if such subchapter were still in effect.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;13908. Registration and other reforms</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Regulations Replacing Certain Programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary, in cooperation with the States, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, shall issue regulations to replace the current Department of Transportation identification number system, the single State registration system under section 14504, the registration system contained in this chapter, and the financial responsibility information system under section 13906 with a single, on-line, Federal system. The new system shall serve as a clearinghouse and depository of information on and identification of all foreign and domestic motor carriers, brokers, and freight forwarders, and others required to register with the Department as well as information on safety fitness and compliance with required levels of financial responsibility. In issuing the regulations, the Secretary shall consider whether or not to integrate the requirements of section 13304 into the new system and may integrate such requirements into the new system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Factors To Be Considered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In conducting the rulemaking under subsection (a), the Secretary shall, at a minimum, consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Funding for State enforcement of motor carrier safety regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Whether the existing single State registration system is duplicative and burdensome.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The justification and need for collecting the statutory fee for such system under section 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The public safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The efficient delivery of transportation services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) How, and under what conditions, to extend the registration system to motor private carriers and to carriers exempt under sections 13502, 13503, and 13506.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Fee System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may establish, under section 9701 of title 31, a fee system for registration and filing evidence of financial responsibility under the new system under subsection (a). Fees collected under the fee system shall cover the costs of operating and upgrading the registration system, including all personnel costs associated with the system. Fees collected under this subsection may be credited to the Department of Transportation appropriations account for purposes for which such fees are collected, and shall be available for expenditure until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Registration Programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines that no State should require insurance filings or collect fees for such filings (including filings and fees authorized under section 14504), the Secretary may prevent any State or political subdivision thereof, or any political authority of 2 or more States, from imposing any insurance filing requirements or fees that are for the same purposes as filings or fees the Secretary requires under the new system under subsection (a). The Secretary may not take any action pursuant to this subsection unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) fees that will be collected by the Secretary under subsection (c) and distributed in each fiscal year to the States will provide each State with at least as much revenue as that State received in fiscal year 1995 under section 11506, as in effect on December 31, 1995; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) all States will receive from the distribution of such fees a minimum apportionment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Deadline for Conclusion; Modifications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 24 months after January 1, 1996, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall conclude the rulemaking under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may implement such changes under this section as the Secretary considers appropriate and in the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall transmit to Congress a report on any findings of the rulemaking and the changes being implemented under this section, together with such recommendations for legislative language necessary to conform this part to such changes.</p>
