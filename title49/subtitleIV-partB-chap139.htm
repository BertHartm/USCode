<h4 class="note-head">Limited Modification to Moratorium on Issuance of Certificates or Permits With Respect to Mexico</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 6, 1993, 58 F.R. 27647, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 [Pub. L. 97&ndash;261, see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)] imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country. The Act [Pub. L. 97&ndash;261, see Tables for classification] authorized the President to remove the moratorium in whole or in part for any country or political subdivision thereof upon determining that such action is in the national interest. Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am pleased that an agreement between the United States and Mexico has been concluded to ensure fair and reciprocal treatment for charter and tour bus interests on both sides of the border. The agreement reached, however, does not allow for full access to cross-border and domestic markets. Therefore, the moratorium must reflect the conditions under which operating authority may be issued to Mexican charter and tour companies under the agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(2)(A)], I hereby make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or special operations, in foreign commerce, in round trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States pursuant to the following restrictions:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The Mexican motor carrier can conduct cross-border charter or special service in the United States only when the international tour or charter begins in Mexico;</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Tickets or tour packages for such operations cannot be sold in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The terms of the grants of authority given to Mexican motor carriers will be limited by the life of the agreement with Mexico covering reciprocal cross-border charter and special operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This action applies only to international charter and tour operations, does not allow for point-to-point service within the United States, and does not authorize companies to conduct cross-border regular route service. This action preserves the status quo with respect to Mexican trucking companies and Mexican companies engaged in regular route service, and will maintain the moratorium on those operations through September 25, 1994, unless earlier revoked or modified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, you are directed to notify the Congress today on my behalf that, effective 60 days hence, the moratorium will no longer be in effect for Mexican charter and tour bus companies subject to the above stated conditions. Because of this action, the Interstate Commerce Commission will then accept and process expeditiously all applications for operating authority from Mexican owned, controlled, or domiciled charter and tour bus firms. I should note that applications in Mexico by United States charter and tour bus firms will be similarly treated.</p>

The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA) [ICC Termination Act of 1995, Pub.

Second, enterprises domiciled in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons of Mexico will be allowed to obtain operating authority to provide bus services between points in the United States. These modifications shall be effective today.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13902(c)(5), I have determined that expeditious action is required to implement these modifications to the moratorium. Effective today, the Department of Transportation will accept and expeditiously process applications, submitted by enterprises domiciled in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons of Mexico, to obtain operating authority to provide truck services for the transportation of international cargo between points in the United States or to provide bus services between points in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Motor carriers domiciled in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons of Mexico will be subject to the same Federal and State regulations and procedures that apply to all other U.S. carriers. These include safety regulations, such as drug and alcohol testing; insurance requirements; taxes and fees; and all other applicable laws and regulations, including those administered by the U.S. Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Nov. 27, 2002, 67 F.R. 71795, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, Public Law 97&ndash;261, 96 Stat. 1103 [see former 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)], imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country and authorized the President to modify the moratorium. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), Public Law 104&ndash;88, 109 Stat. 803 [ICC Termination Act of 1995, see Tables for classification], maintained these restrictions, subject to modifications made prior to the enactment of the ICCTA [Dec. 29, 1995], and empowered the President to make further modifications to the moratorium.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13902(c)(3), I modified the moratorium on June 5, 2001, to allow motor carriers domiciled in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons of Mexico to obtain operating authority to transport international cargo by truck between points in the United States and to provide bus services between points in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) established a schedule for liberalizing certain restrictions on the provision of bus and truck services by Mexican-domiciled motor carriers in the United States. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13902(c)(3), I hereby determine that the following modifications to the moratorium are consistent with obligations of the United States under NAFTA and with our national transportation policy and that the moratorium shall be modified accordingly.</p>
<p class="note-body">First, qualified motor carriers domiciled in Mexico will be allowed to obtain operating authority to transport passengers in cross-border scheduled bus services. Second, qualified motor carriers domiciled in Mexico will be allowed to obtain operating authority to provide cross-border truck services. The moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to Mexican-domiciled motor carriers for the provision of truck or bus services between points in the United States will remain in place. These modifications shall be effective on the date of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">Furthermore, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13902(c)(5), I hereby determine that expeditious action is required to implement this modification to the moratorium. Effective on the date of this memorandum, the Department of Transportation is authorized to act on applications, submitted by motor carriers domiciled in Mexico, to obtain operating authority to provide cross-border scheduled bus services and cross-border truck services. In reviewing such applications, the Department shall continue to work closely with the Department of Justice, the Office of Homeland Security, and other relevant Federal departments, agencies, and offices in order to help ensure the security of the border and to prevent potential threats to national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">Motor carriers domiciled in Mexico operating in the United States will be subject to the same Federal and State laws, regulations, and procedures that apply to carriers domiciled in the United States. These include safety regulations, such as drug and alcohol testing requirements; insurance requirements; taxes and fees; and other applicable laws and regulations, including those administered by the United States Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Department of Labor, and Federal and State environmental agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:341 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Liability insurance requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may register a motor carrier under section 13902 only if the registrant files with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary, in an amount not less than such amount as the Secretary prescribes pursuant to, or as is required by, sections 31138 and 31139, and the laws of the State or States in which the registrant is operating, to the extent applicable. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the registrant for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles, or for loss or damage to property (except property referred to in paragraph (3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13906_1_target" name="13906_1">1</a></sup> of this subsection), or both. A registration remains in effect only as long as the registrant continues to satisfy the security requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Security requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of the Unified Carrier Registration Act of 2005, any person, other than a motor private carrier, registered with the Secretary to provide transportation or service as a motor carrier under section 13905(b) shall file with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Secretary, in an amount not less than required by sections 31138 and 31139.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Agency requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A motor carrier shall comply with the requirements of sections 13303 and 13304. To protect the public, the Secretary may require any such motor carrier to file the type of security that a motor carrier is required to file under paragraph (1) of this subsection. This paragraph only applies to a foreign motor private carrier and foreign motor carrier operating in the United States to the extent that such carrier is providing transportation between places in a foreign country or between a place in one foreign country and a place in another foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Transportation insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may require a registered motor carrier to file with the Secretary a type of security sufficient to pay a shipper or consignee for damage to property of the shipper or consignee placed in the possession of the motor carrier as the result of transportation provided under this part. A carrier required by law to pay a shipper or consignee for loss, damage, or default for which a connecting motor carrier is responsible is subrogated, to the extent of the amount paid, to the rights of the shipper or consignee under any such security.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Carriers Responsible for Agents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each motor carrier providing transportation of household goods shall be responsible for all acts or omissions of any of its agents which relate to the performance of household goods transportation services (including accessorial or terminal services) and which are within the actual or apparent authority of the agent from the carrier or which are ratified by the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Standard for Selecting Agents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each motor carrier providing transportation of household goods shall use due diligence and reasonable care in selecting and maintaining agents who are sufficiently knowledgeable, fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) and to fulfill the obligations imposed upon them by this part and by such carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Complaint</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe from a complaint or investigation that an agent providing household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) under the authority of a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods has violated section 14901(e) or 14912 or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), the Secretary may issue to such agent a complaint stating the charges and containing notice of the time and place of a hearing which shall be held no later than 60 days after service of the complaint to such agent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the agent does not appear at the hearing or if the Secretary finds that the agent has violated section 14901(e) or 14912 or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), the Secretary may issue an order to compel compliance with the requirement that the agent be fit, willing, and able. Thereafter, the Secretary may issue an order to limit, condition, or prohibit such agent from any involvement in the transportation or provision of services incidental to the transportation of household goods if, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds that such agent, within a reasonable time after the date of issuance of a compliance order under this section, but in no event less than 30 days after such date of issuance, has willfully failed to comply with such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon filing of a petition with the Secretary by an agent who is the subject of an order issued pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection and after notice, a hearing shall be held with an opportunity to be heard.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Court review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any agent adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Secretary issued under this subsection may seek relief in the appropriate United States court of appeals as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Applicability of Antitrust Laws.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to discussions or agreements between a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods and its agents (whether or not an agent is also a carrier) related solely to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) rates for the transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Board review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board, upon its own initiative or request, shall review any activities undertaken under paragraph (1) and shall modify or terminate the activity if necessary to protect the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Household goods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;household goods&rdquo; has the meaning such term had under section 10102(11) of this title, as in effect on December 31, 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; means transportation that would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, as in effect on December 31, 1995, if such subchapter were still in effect.</p>
