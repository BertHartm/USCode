<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Certain household goods transportation; joint rates involving water transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A rate, classification, rule, or practice related to transportation or service provided by a carrier subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 for transportation or service involving&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a movement of household goods,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a rate for a movement by or with a water carrier in noncontiguous domestic trade, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Prescription by Board for Violations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Board finds it necessary to stop or prevent a violation of subsection (a), the Board shall prescribe the rate, classification, rule, practice, through route, or division of joint rates to be applied for such transportation or service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Filing of Complaint</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A complaint that a rate, classification, rule, or practice in noncontiguous domestic trade violates subsection (a) may be filed with the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Zone of Reasonableness.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, a rate or division of a motor carrier for service in noncontiguous domestic trade or water carrier for port-to-port service in that trade is reasonable if the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate or division is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate or division in effect 1 year before the effective date of the proposed rate or division.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Adjustments to the zone</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The percentage specified in paragraph (1) shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the percentage change in the Producers Price Index, as published by the Department of Labor, that has occurred during the most recent 1-year period before the date the rate or division in question first took effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Determinations after complaint</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall determine whether any rate or division of a carrier or service in noncontiguous domestic trade which is not within the range described in paragraph (1) is reasonable if a complaint is filed under subsection (c) or section 13702(b)(6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Reparations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon a finding of violation of subsection (a), the Board shall award reparations to the complaining shipper or shippers in an amount equal to all sums assessed and collected that exceed the determined reasonable rate, division, rate structure, or tariff. Upon complaint from any governmental agency or authority and upon a finding or violation of subsection (a), the Board shall make such orders as are just and shall require the carrier to return, to the extent practicable, to shippers all amounts plus interest, which the Board finds to have been assessed and collected in violation of subsection (a).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Nonpreferential; nonpredatory</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any rate established under this subsection must be available on a nonpreferential basis to shippers and must not result in charges to shippers which are predatory.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 may establish rates for the transportation of household goods which guarantee that the carrier will pick up and deliver such household goods at the times specified in the contract for such services and provide a penalty or per diem payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver such household goods at the specified time. The charges, if any, for such guarantee and penalty provision may vary to reflect one or more options available to meet a particular shipper's needs.</p>

When the shipper or consignor instructs the carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property&mdash;</p>

The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the carrier erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property is liable for the additional rates.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It shall be an unreasonable practice for a motor carrier of property (other than a household goods carrier) providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 or, before January 1, 1996, to have provided transportation that was subject to jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105, as in effect on December 31, 1995, a freight forwarder (other than a household goods freight forwarder), or a party representing such a carrier or freight forwarder to attempt to charge or to charge for a transportation service the difference between (1) the applicable rate that was lawfully in effect pursuant to a tariff that was filed in accordance with this chapter or, with respect to transportation provided before January 1, 1996, in accordance with chapter 107, as in effect on the date the transportation was provided, by the carrier or freight forwarder applicable to such transportation service, and (2) the negotiated rate for such transportation service if the carrier or freight forwarder is no longer transporting property between places described in section 13501(1) or is transporting property between places described in section 13501(1) for the purpose of avoiding application of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:351 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Jurisdiction of Board.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall have jurisdiction to make a determination of whether or not attempting to charge or the charging of a rate by a motor carrier or freight forwarder or party representing a motor carrier or freight forwarder is an unreasonable practice under subsection (a). If the Board determines that attempting to charge or the charging of the rate is an unreasonable practice under subsection (a), the carrier, freight forwarder, or party may not collect the difference described in subsection (a) between the applicable rate and the negotiated rate for the transportation service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Factors to consider</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a determination under paragraph (1), the Board shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the person was offered a transportation rate by the carrier or freight forwarder or party other than that legally on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board, as required, at the time of the movement for the transportation service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the person tendered freight to the carrier or freight forwarder in reasonable reliance upon the offered transportation rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the carrier or freight forwarder did not properly or timely file with the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board, as required, a tariff providing for such transportation rate or failed to enter into an agreement for contract carriage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether the transportation rate was billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) whether the carrier or freight forwarder or party demands additional payment of a higher rate filed in a tariff.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Stay of Additional Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a person proceeds under this section to challenge the reasonableness of the practice of a motor carrier, freight forwarder, or party described in subsection (a) to attempt to charge or to charge the difference described in subsection (a) between the applicable rate and the negotiated rate for the transportation service in addition to those charges already billed and collected for the transportation service, the person shall not have to pay any additional compensation to the carrier, freight forwarder, or party until the Board has made a determination as to the reasonableness of the practice as applied to the freight of the person against whom the claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Treatment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) is an exception to the requirements of section 13702 and, for transportation provided before January 1, 1996, to the requirements of sections 10761(a) and 10762, as in effect on December 31, 1995, as such sections relate to a filed tariff rate and other general tariff requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplicability of Negotiated Rate Dispute Resolution Procedure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person elects to seek enforcement of subsection (a) with respect to a rate for a transportation or service, section 13709 shall not apply to such rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;negotiated rate&rdquo; means a rate, charge, classification, or rule agreed upon by a motor carrier or freight forwarder and a shipper through negotiations pursuant to which no tariff was lawfully and timely filed and for which there is written evidence of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Applicability to Pending Cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section shall apply to all cases and proceedings pending on January 1, 1996.</p>
