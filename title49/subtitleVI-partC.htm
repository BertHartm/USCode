<p class="note-body">In clause (1), the text of 15:1901(11) is omitted as surplus because the complete title of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section. The definition of &ldquo;property loss reduction standard&rdquo; is combined with the definition of &ldquo;bumper standard&rdquo; because the former term is used only in the definition of the latter term. Before subclause (A), the words &ldquo;the purpose of which is&rdquo; and &ldquo;eliminate&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In subclauses (A) and (B), the words &ldquo;(or both)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In subclause (A), the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (2), the words &ldquo;of passenger motor vehicles&rdquo; and &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5)(A), the words &ldquo;manufacturing or assembling&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>

<p class="note-body">In clauses (12) and (13), the words &ldquo;the Northern Mariana Islands&rdquo; are added because of section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, as enacted by the Act of March 24, 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;241, 90 Stat. 268), and as proclaimed to be in effect by the President on January 9, 1978 (Proc. No. 4534, Oct. 24, 1977, 42 F.R. 56593). The words &ldquo;the Canal Zone&rdquo; are omitted because of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12), the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;includes&rdquo; as being more appropriate. The words &ldquo;a State of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;each of the several States&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (13), the words &ldquo;of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because the district court of Puerto Rico is a district court of the United States under 28:119.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements and Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by regulation bumper standards for passenger motor vehicles and may prescribe by regulation bumper standards for passenger motor vehicle equipment manufactured in, or imported into, the United States. A standard does not apply to a passenger motor vehicle or passenger motor vehicle equipment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) intended only for export;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) labeled for export on the vehicle or equipment and the outside of any container of the vehicle or equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) exported.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not conflict with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under chapter 301 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may not specify a dollar amount for the cost of repairing damage to a passenger motor vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the greatest practicable extent, may not preclude the attachment of a detachable hitch.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For good cause, the Secretary may exempt from all or any part of a standard&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a multipurpose passenger vehicle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a make, model, or class of a passenger motor vehicle manufactured for a special use, if the standard would interfere unreasonably with the special use of the vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a passenger motor vehicle for which an application for an exemption under section 30013(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#32502_1_target" name="32502_1">1</a></sup> of this title has been filed in accordance with the requirements of that section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Cost Reduction and Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a standard under this section, the Secretary shall design the standard to obtain the maximum feasible reduction of costs to the public, considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the costs and benefits of carrying out the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the effect of the standard on insurance costs and legal fees and costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) savings in consumer time and inconvenience; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) health and safety, including emission standards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 553 of title 5 applies to a standard prescribed under this section. However, the Secretary shall give an interested person an opportunity to make oral and written presentations of information, views, and arguments. A transcript of each oral presentation shall be kept. Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to resolve an issue of fact material to a standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe an effective date for a standard under this section. That date may not be earlier than the date the standard is prescribed nor later than 18 months after the date the standard is prescribed. However, the Secretary may prescribe a later date when the Secretary submits to Congress and publishes the reasons for the later date. A standard only applies to a passenger motor vehicle or passenger motor vehicle equipment manufactured on or after the effective date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Research</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall conduct research necessary to carry out this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;32705. Disclosure requirements on transfer of motor vehicles</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation that include the way in which information is disclosed and retained under this section, a person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle shall give the transferee the following written disclosure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Disclosure of the cumulative mileage registered on the odometer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Disclosure that the actual mileage is unknown, if the transferor knows that the odometer reading is different from the number of miles the vehicle has actually traveled.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle may not violate a regulation prescribed under this section or give a false statement to the transferee in making the disclosure required by such a regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person acquiring a motor vehicle for resale may not accept a written disclosure under this section unless it is complete.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) This subsection shall apply to all transfers of motor vehicles (unless otherwise exempted by the Secretary by regulation), except in the case of transfers of new motor vehicles from a vehicle manufacturer jointly to a dealer and a person engaged in the business of renting or leasing vehicles for a period of 30 days or less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;new motor vehicle&rdquo; means any motor vehicle driven with no more than the limited use necessary in moving, transporting, or road testing such vehicle prior to delivery from the vehicle manufacturer to a dealer, but in no event shall the odometer reading of such vehicle exceed 300 miles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may exempt such classes or categories of vehicles as the Secretary deems appropriate from these requirements. Until such time as the Secretary amends or modifies the regulations set forth in 49 CFR 580.6, such regulations shall have full force and effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Mileage Statement Requirement for Licensing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A motor vehicle the ownership of which is transferred may not be licensed for use in a State unless the transferee, in submitting an application to a State for the title on which the license will be issued, includes with the application the transferor's title and, if that title contains the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection, a statement, signed and dated by the transferor, of the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. This paragraph does not apply to a transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle that has not been licensed before the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the title to a motor vehicle issued to a transferor by a State is in the possession of a lienholder when the transferor transfers ownership of the vehicle, the transferor may use a written power of attorney (if allowed by State law) in making the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. Regulations prescribed under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall prescribe the form of the power of attorney;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall provide that the form be printed by means of a secure printing process (or other secure process);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall provide that the State issue the form to the transferee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) shall provide that the person exercising the power of attorney retain a copy and submit the original to the State with a copy of the title showing the restatement of the mileage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) may require that the State retain the power of attorney and the copy of the title for an appropriate period or that the State adopt alternative measures consistent with section 32701(b) of this title, after considering the costs to the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) shall ensure that the mileage at the time of transfer be disclosed on the power of attorney document;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) shall ensure that the mileage be restated exactly by the person exercising the power of attorney in the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) may not require that a motor vehicle be titled in the State in which the power of attorney was issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ix) shall consider the need to facilitate normal commercial transactions in the sale or exchange of motor vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(x) shall provide other conditions the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Section 32709(a) and (b) applies to a person granting or granted a power of attorney under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A motor vehicle the ownership of which is transferred may not be licensed for use in a State unless the title issued by the State to the transferee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is produced by means of a secure printing process (or other secure process);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) indicates the mileage disclosure required to be made under subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) contains a space for the transferee to disclose the mileage at the time of a future transfer and to sign and date the disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph does not require a State to verify, or preclude a State from verifying, the mileage information contained in the title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Leased Motor Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For a leased motor vehicle, the regulations prescribed under <!-- PDFPage:601 -->subsection (a) of this section shall require written disclosure about mileage to be made by the lessee to the lessor when the lessor transfers ownership of that vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under those regulations, the lessor shall provide written notice to the lessee of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the lessee's mileage disclosure requirements under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The lessor shall retain the disclosures made by a lessee under paragraph (1) of this subsection for at least 4 years following the date the lessor transfers the leased motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the lessor transfers ownership of a leased motor vehicle without obtaining possession of the vehicle, the lessor, in making the disclosure required by subsection (a) of this section, may indicate on the title the mileage disclosed by the lessee under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the lessor has reason to believe that the disclosure by the lessee does not reflect the actual mileage of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Alternate Vehicle Mileage Disclosure Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirements of subsections (b) and (c)(1) of this section on the disclosure of motor vehicle mileage when motor vehicles are transferred or leased apply in a State unless the State has in effect alternate motor vehicle mileage disclosure requirements approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall approve alternate motor vehicle mileage disclosure requirements submitted by a State unless the Secretary decides that the requirements are not consistent with the purpose of the disclosure required by subsection (b) or (c), as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Auction Sales</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a motor vehicle is sold at an auction, the auction company conducting the auction shall maintain the following records for at least 4 years after the date of the sale:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the name of the most recent owner of the motor vehicle (except the auction company) and the name of the buyer of the motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the vehicle identification number required under chapter 301 or 331 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the odometer reading on the date the auction company took possession of the motor vehicle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application and Revision of State Law</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, subsections (b)&ndash;(e) of this section apply to the transfer of a motor vehicle after April 28, 1989.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a State requests, the Secretary shall assist the State in revising its laws to comply with subsection (b) of this section. If a State requires time beyond April 28, 1989, to revise its laws to achieve compliance, the Secretary, on request of the State, may grant additional time that the Secretary considers reasonable by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. The notice shall include the reasons for granting the additional time. In granting additional time, the Secretary shall ensure that the State is making reasonable efforts to achieve compliance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; means a valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter sufficient to justify the inspection or impoundment in the circumstances stated in an application for a warrant under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Warrant Requirement and Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, an inspection or impoundment under section 32706 of this title may be carried out only after a warrant is obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A judge of a court of the United States or a State court of record or a United States magistrate may issue a warrant for an inspection or impoundment under section 32706 of this title within the territorial jurisdiction of the court or magistrate. The warrant must be based on an affidavit that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:604 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establishes probable cause to issue the warrant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is sworn to before the judge or magistrate by an officer or employee who knows the facts alleged in the affidavit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The judge or magistrate shall issue the warrant when the judge or magistrate decides there is a reasonable basis for believing that probable cause exists to issue the warrant. The warrant must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identify the premises, property, or motor vehicle to be inspected and the items or type of property to be impounded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) state the purpose of the inspection, the basis for issuing the warrant, and the name of the affiant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) direct an individual authorized under section 32706 of this title to inspect the premises, property, or vehicle for the purpose stated in the warrant and, when appropriate, to impound the property specified in the warrant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) direct that the warrant be served during the hours specified in the warrant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) name the judge or magistrate with whom proof of service is to be filed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A warrant under this section is not required when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the premises consents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is reasonable to believe that the mobility of the motor vehicle to be inspected makes it impractical to obtain a warrant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an application for a warrant cannot be made because of an emergency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) records are to be inspected and copied under section 32706(e)(1)(A) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a warrant is not constitutionally required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service and Impoundment of Property</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A warrant issued under this section must be served and proof of service filed not later than 10 days after its issuance date. The judge or magistrate may allow additional time in the warrant if the Secretary of Transportation demonstrates a need for additional time. Proof of service must be filed promptly with a written inventory of the property impounded under the warrant. The inventory shall be made in the presence of the individual serving the warrant and the individual from whose possession or premises the property was impounded, or if that individual is not present, a credible individual except the individual making the inventory. The individual serving the warrant shall verify the inventory. On request, the judge or magistrate shall send a copy of the inventory to the individual from whose possession or premises the property was impounded and to the applicant for the warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When property is impounded under a warrant, the individual serving the warrant shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give the person from whose possession or premises the property was impounded a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the property was impounded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The judge or magistrate shall file the warrant, proof of service, and all documents filed about the warrant with the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which the inspection is made.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;32902. Average fuel economy standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Non-Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 18 months before the beginning of each model year, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by regulation average fuel economy standards for automobiles (except passenger automobiles) manufactured by a manufacturer in that model year. Each standard shall be the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretary decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year. The Secretary may prescribe separate standards for different classes of automobiles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a model year after model year 1984 shall be 27.5 miles a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Amending Passenger Automobile Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending the standard under subsection (b) of this section for a model year to a level that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for that model year. Section 553 of title 5 applies to a proceeding to amend the standard. However, any interested person may make an oral presentation and a transcript shall be taken of that presentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an amendment increases the standard above 27.5 miles a gallon or decreases the standard below 26.0 miles a gallon, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit the amendment to Congress. The procedures of section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6421) apply to an amendment, except that the 15 calendar days referred to in section 551(c) and (d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(c), (d)) are deemed to be 60 calendar days, and the 5 calendar days referred to in section 551(f)(4)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(f)(4)(A)) are deemed to be 20 calendar days. If either House of Congress disapproves the amendment under those procedures, the amendment does not take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, on application of a manufacturer that manufactured (whether in the United States or not) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the model year 2 years before the model year for which the application is made, the Secretary of Transportation may exempt by regulation the manufacturer from a standard under subsection (b) or (c) of this section. An exemption for a model year applies only if the manufacturer manufactures (whether in the United States or not) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the model year. The Secretary may exempt a manufacturer only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) finds that the applicable standard under those subsections is more stringent than the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the manufacturer can achieve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prescribes by regulation an alternative average fuel economy standard for the passenger automobiles manufactured by the exempted manufacturer that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for the manufacturers to which the alternative standard applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alternative average fuel economy standard the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection may apply to an individually exempted manufacturer, to all automobiles to which this subsection applies, or to classes of passenger automobiles, as defined under regulations of the Secretary, manufactured by exempted manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, an importer registered under section 30141(c) of this title may not be exempted as a manufacturer under paragraph (1) for a motor vehicle that the importer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) imports; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) brings into compliance with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under chapter 301 of this title for an individual under section 30142 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:610 --><p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe the contents of an application for an exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;emergency vehicle&rdquo; means an automobile manufactured primarily for use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as an ambulance or combination ambulance-hearse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by the United States Government or a State or local government for law enforcement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for other emergency uses prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A manufacturer may elect to have the fuel economy of an emergency vehicle excluded in applying a fuel economy standard under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section. The election is made by providing written notice to the Secretary of Transportation and to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Considerations on Decisions on Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When deciding maximum feasible average fuel economy under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to conserve energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Requirements for Other Amendments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending an average fuel economy standard prescribed under subsection (a) or (d) of this section if the amended standard meets the requirements of subsection (a) or (d), as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary of Transportation prescribes an amendment under this section that makes an average fuel economy standard more stringent, the Secretary shall prescribe the amendment (and submit the amendment to Congress when required under subsection (c)(2) of this section) at least 18 months before the beginning of the model year to which the amendment applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsections (c), (f), and (g) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not consider the fuel economy of dedicated automobiles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall consider dual fueled automobiles to be operated only on gasoline or diesel fuel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in carrying out this section and section 32903 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Secretary of Energy Comments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Before issuing a notice proposing to prescribe or amend an average fuel economy standard under subsection (a), (c), or (g) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall give the Secretary of Energy at least 10 days from the receipt of the notice during which the Secretary of Energy may, if the Secretary of Energy concludes that the proposed standard would adversely affect the conservation goals of the Secretary of Energy, provide written comments to the Secretary of Transportation about the impact of the standard on those goals. To the extent the Secretary of Transportation does not revise a proposed standard to take into account comments of the Secretary of Energy on any adverse impact of the standard, the Secretary of Transportation shall include those comments in the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before taking final action on a standard or an exemption from a standard under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the Secretary of Energy and provide the Secretary of Energy a reasonable time to comment.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Earning and Period for Applying Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the average fuel economy of passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a particular model year exceeds an applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title (determined by the Secretary of Transportation without regard to credits under this section), the manufacturer earns credits. The credits may be applied to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any of the 3 consecutive model years immediately before the model year for which the credits are earned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent not used under clause (1) of this subsection, any of the 3 consecutive model years immediately after the model year for which the credits are earned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Period of Availability and Plan for Future Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, credits under this section are available to a manufacturer at the end of the model year in which earned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Before the end of a model year, if a manufacturer has reason to believe that its average fuel economy for passenger automobiles will be less than the applicable standard for that model year, the manufacturer may submit a plan to the Secretary of Transportation demonstrating that the manufacturer will earn sufficient credits under this section within the next 3 model years to allow the manufacturer to meet that standard for the model year involved. Unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer is unlikely to earn sufficient credits under the plan, the Secretary shall approve the plan. Those credits are available for the model year involved if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary approves the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the manufacturer earns those credits as provided by the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer is less than the applicable standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title after applying credits under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the manufacturer and give the manufacturer a reasonable time (of at least 60 days) to submit a plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determining Number of Credits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The number of credits a manufacturer earns under this section equals the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of tenths of a mile a gallon by which the average fuel economy of the passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer in the model year in which the credits are earned exceeds the applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(b)&ndash;(d) of this title; times</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the number of passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer during that model year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Applying Credits for Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall apply credits to a model year on the basis of the number of tenths of a mile a gallon by which the manufacturer involved was below the applicable average fuel economy standard for that model year and the number of passenger automobiles manufactured that model year by the manufacturer. Credits applied to a model year are no longer available for another model year. Before applying credits, the Secretary shall give the manufacturer written notice and reasonable opportunity to comment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applying Credits for Non-Passenger Automobiles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Credits for a manufacturer of automobiles that are not passenger automobiles are earned and applied to a model year in which the average fuel economy of that class of automobiles is below the applicable average fuel economy standard under section 32902(a) of this title, to the same extent and in the same way as provided in this section for passenger automobiles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Refund of Collected Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a civil penalty has been collected under this chapter from a manufacturer that has earned credits under this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall refund to the manufacturer the <!-- PDFPage:612 -->amount of the penalty to the extent the penalty is attributable to credits available under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the number of passenger automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer in a model year; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the sum of the fractions obtained by dividing the number of passenger automobiles of each model manufactured by the manufacturer in that model year by the fuel economy measured for that model.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In this paragraph, &ldquo;electric vehicle&rdquo; means a vehicle powered primarily by an electric motor drawing electrical current from a portable source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a manufacturer manufactures an electric vehicle, the Administrator shall include in the calculation of average fuel economy under paragraph (1) of this subsection equivalent petroleum based fuel economy values determined by the Secretary of Energy for various classes of electric vehicles. The Secretary shall review those values each year and determine and propose necessary revisions based on the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the approximate electrical energy efficiency of the vehicle, considering the kind of vehicle and the mission and weight of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the national average electrical generation and transmission efficiencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the need of the United States to conserve all forms of energy and the relative scarcity and value to the United States of all fuel used to generate electricity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the specific patterns of use of electric vehicles compared to petroleum-fueled vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Separate Calculations for Passenger Automobiles Manufactured Domestically and Not Domestically</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subsection, the Administrator shall make separate calculations under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) A manufacturer not described in clause (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph that assembles automobiles in the United States or Canada, but not in Mexico, may elect, during the period from January 1, 1997, through January 1, 2004, to have subparagraph (A) of this paragraph apply to all automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer beginning with the model year that begins after the date of the election. However, if the manufacturer begins assembling automobiles in Mexico before making an election under this subparagraph, this clause does not apply, and the manufacturer is subject to clause (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) For a manufacturer that does not assemble automobiles in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, subparagraph (A) of this paragraph applies to all automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer beginning with the model year that begins after January 1, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) For a manufacturer described in clause (i) or (iii) of this subparagraph that does not make an election within the specified period, subparagraph (A) of this paragraph applies to all automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer beginning with the model year that begins after January 1, 2004.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe reasonable procedures for elections under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this subsection, the fuel economy of a passenger automobile that is not manufactured domestically is deemed to be equal to the average fuel economy of all passenger automobiles manufactured by the same manufacturer that are not manufactured domestically.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) A manufacturer may submit to the Secretary of Transportation for approval a plan, including supporting material, stating the actions and the deadlines for taking the actions, that will ensure that the model or models referred to in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph will be manufactured domestically before the end of the 4th model year covered by the plan. The Secretary promptly shall consider and act on the plan. The Secretary shall approve the plan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary finds that the plan is inadequate to meet the requirements of this paragraph; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the manufacturer previously has submitted a plan approved by the Secretary under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the plan is approved, the Administrator shall include under paragraph (1)(A)(i) and exclude under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) of this subsection, for each of the 4 model years covered by the plan, not more than 150,000 passenger automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer but not qualifying as domestically manufactured if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the model or models involved previously have not been manufactured domestically;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) at least 50 percent of the cost to the manufacturer of each of the automobiles is attributable to value added in the United States or Canada;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the automobiles, if their assembly was completed in Canada, are imported into the United States not later than 30 days after the end of the model year; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) after April 30, 1980, if the manufacturer has engaged in the production or assembly in the United States for at least one model year ending before January 1, 1986.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Transportation shall grant the exemption unless the Secretary finds that the exemption would result in reduced employment in the United States related to motor vehicle manufacturing during the period of the exemption. An exemption under this paragraph is effective for 5 model years or, if requested by the manufacturer, a longer period provided by the Secretary in the order granting the exemption. The exemption applies to passenger automobiles manufactured by that manufacturer during the period of the exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Before granting an exemption, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide notice of, and reasonable opportunity for, written or oral comment about the petition. The period for comment shall end not later than 60 days after the petition is filed, except that the Secretary may extend the period for not more than another 30 days. The Secretary shall decide whether to grant or deny the exemption, and publish notice of the decision in the Federal Register, not later than 90 days after the petition is filed, except that the Secretary may extend the time for decision to a later date (not later than 150 days after the petition is filed) if the Secretary publishes notice of, and reasons for, the extension in the Federal Register. If the Secretary does not make a decision within the time provided in this subparagraph, the petition is deemed to have been granted. Not later than 30 days after the end of the decision period, the Secretary shall submit a written statement of the reasons for not making a decision to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) A person adversely affected by a decision of the Secretary of Transportation granting or denying an exemption may file, not later than 30 days after publication of the notice of the decision, a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court has exclusive jurisdiction to review the decision and to affirm, remand, or set aside the decision under section 706(2)(A)&ndash;(D) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A judgment of the court under this subparagraph may be reviewed by the Supreme <!-- PDFPage:614 -->Court under section 1254 of title 28. Application for review by the Supreme Court must be made not later than 30 days after entry of the court's judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A decision of the Secretary of Transportation on a petition for an exemption under this paragraph may be reviewed administratively or judicially only as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Notwithstanding section 32903 of this title, during a model year when an exemption under this paragraph is effective for a manufacturer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) credit may not be earned under section 32903(a) of this title by the manufacturer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) credit may not be made available under section 32903(b)(2) of this title for the manufacturer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Testing and Calculation Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall measure fuel economy for each model and calculate average fuel economy for a manufacturer under testing and calculation procedures prescribed by the Administrator. However, except under section 32908 of this title, the Administrator shall use the same procedures for passenger automobiles the Administrator used for model year 1975 (weighted 55 percent urban cycle and 45 percent highway cycle), or procedures that give comparable results. A measurement of fuel economy or a calculation of average fuel economy (except under section 32908) shall be rounded off to the nearest .1 of a mile a gallon. The Administrator shall decide on the quantity of other fuel that is equivalent to one gallon of gasoline. To the extent practicable, fuel economy tests shall be carried out with emissions tests under section 206 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7525).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date of Procedure or Amendment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe a procedure under this section, or an amendment (except a technical or clerical amendment) in a procedure, at least 12 months before the beginning of the model year to which the procedure or amendment applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Reports and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall report measurements and calculations under this section to the Secretary of Transportation and shall consult and coordinate with the Secretary in carrying out this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;32906. Maximum fuel economy increase for alternative fuel automobiles</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Increases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) For each of model years 1993&ndash;2010 for each category of automobile (except an electric automobile), the maximum increase in average fuel economy for a manufacturer attributable to dual fueled automobiles is 1.2 miles a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the application of section 32905(b) and (d) of this title is extended under section 32905(f) of this title, for each category of automobile (except an electric automobile) the maximum increase in average fuel economy for a manufacturer for each of model years 2011&ndash;2014 attributable to dual fueled automobiles is .9 mile a gallon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In applying paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall determine the increase in a manufacturer's average fuel economy attributable to dual fueled automobiles by subtracting from the manufacturer's average fuel economy calculated under section 32905(e) of this title the number equal to what the manufacturer's average fuel economy would be if it were calculated by the formula in section 32904(a)(1) of this title by including as the denominator for each model of dual fueled automobile the fuel economy when the automobiles are operated on gasoline or diesel fuel. If the increase attributable to dual fueled automobiles for any model year described&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection is more than 1.2 miles a gallon, the limitation in paragraph (1)(A) applies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection is more than .9 mile a gallon, the limitation in paragraph (1)(B) applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Offsets</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding this section and sections 32901(c) and 32905 of this title, if the Secretary of Transportation reduces the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles for any model year below 27.5 miles a gallon, an increase in average fuel economy for passenger automobiles of more than .7 mile a gallon to which a manufacturer of dual fueled automobiles would otherwise be entitled is reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the reduction in the standard. However, the increase may not be reduced to less than .7 mile a gallon.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) necessary to prevent the insolvency or bankruptcy of the manufacturer of automobiles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the manufacturer shows that the violation was caused by an act of God, a strike, or a fire; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Federal Trade Commission certifies under subsection (b)(1) of this section that a reduction in the penalty is necessary to prevent a substantial lessening of competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Certification by Commission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A manufacturer liable for a civil penalty under section 32912(b) of this title may apply to the Commission for a certification that a reduction in the penalty is necessary to prevent a substantial lessening of competition in the segment of the motor vehicle industry subject to the standard that was violated. The Commission shall make the certification when it finds that reduction is necessary to prevent the lessening. The Commission shall state in the certification the maximum amount by which the penalty may be reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application under this subsection must be made not later than 30 days after the Secretary decides that the manufacturer has violated section 32911(b) of this title. To the maximum extent practicable, the Commission shall make a decision on an application by the 90th day after the application is filed. A proceeding under this subsection may not delay the manufacturer's liability for the penalty for more than 90 days after the application is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a civil penalty is collected in a civil action under this chapter before a decision of the Commission under this subsection is final, the payment shall be paid to the court in which the action was brought. The court shall deposit the payment in the general fund of the Treasury on the 90th day after the decision of the Commission becomes final. When the court is holding payment of a penalty reduced under subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary shall direct the court to remit the appropriate amount of the penalty to the manufacturer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than October 25, 1994, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe a vehicle theft standard that conforms to the requirements of this chapter for covered major parts that manufacturers install in passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) in not more than 50 percent of the lines not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Extension of Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than 3 years after the standard is prescribed under subsection (a) of this section and based on the finding of the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section to apply the standard, the Secretary shall apply that standard to covered major parts and major replacement parts for covered parts that manufacturers install in the lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not covered by the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall include as part of the regulatory proceeding under this subsection the finding of, and the record developed by, the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Initial Review of Effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Secretary begins a regulatory proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall make a finding that the Secretary shall apply the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section unless the Attorney General finds, based on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title and other information the Attorney General develops after providing notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that applying the standard prescribed in subsection (a) to the remaining lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) not covered by that standard would not substantially inhibit chop shop operations and motor vehicle thefts. The Attorney General also shall consider and include in the record additional costs, effectiveness, competition, and available alternative factors. The Attorney General shall submit to the Secretary the finding and record on which the finding is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Long Range Review of Effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than December 31, 1999, the Attorney General shall make separate findings, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, on the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this subsection, or both, have been effective in substantially inhibiting the operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the anti-theft devices for which the Secretary has granted exemptions under section 33106 of this title are an effective substitute for parts marking in substantially inhibiting motor vehicle theft.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:630 --><p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In making the finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) base that finding on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) consider the effectiveness, the extent of use, and the extent to which civil and criminal penalties under section 33115(b) of this title and section 2322 of title 18 on chop shops have been effective in substantially inhibiting operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) base that finding on the 3-year and 5-year reports issued by the Secretary under section 33113 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) base that finding on other information the Attorney General develops and includes in the public record.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall submit a finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection promptly to the Secretary. If the Attorney General finds that the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or both, has not been effective, the Secretary shall issue, not later than 180 days after receiving that finding, an order terminating the standard the Attorney General found was ineffective. The termination is effective for the model year beginning after the order is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making a finding under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives. If the Attorney General finds that the anti-theft devices are an effective substitute, the Secretary shall continue to grant exemptions under section 33106 of this title for the model years after model year 2000 at one of the following levels that the Attorney General decides: at the level authorized before October 25, 1992, or at the level provided in section 33106(b)(2)(C) of this title for model year 2000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date of Standard</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard prescribed under this section takes effect at least 6 months after the date the standard is prescribed, except that the Secretary may prescribe an earlier effective date if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) decides with good cause that the earlier date is in the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publishes the reasons for the decision.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Notification of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary and the Attorney General shall inform the appropriate legislative committees of Congress with jurisdiction over this part and section 2322 of title 18 of actions taken or planned under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;33104. Designation of high theft vehicle lines and parts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Designation, Nonapplication, Selection, and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For purposes of the standard under section 33102 of this title, the following are high theft lines:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a passenger motor vehicle line determined under subsection (b) of this section to have had a new passenger motor vehicle theft <!-- PDFPage:631 -->rate in the 2-year period covering calendar years 1990 and 1991 greater than the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts in that 2-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a passenger motor vehicle line initially introduced into commerce in the United States after December 31, 1989, that is selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as likely to have a theft rate greater than the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a passenger motor vehicle line having (for existing lines) or likely to have (for new lines) a theft rate below the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph, if the major parts in the vehicles are selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as interchangeable with the majority of the major parts that are subject to the standard and are contained in the motor vehicles of a line described in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standard may not apply to any major part of a line described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection if all the passenger motor vehicles of lines that are, or are likely to be, below the median theft rate, and that contain parts interchangeable with the major parts of the line involved, account (for existing lines), or the Secretary of Transportation determines they are likely to account (for new lines), for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all lines of that manufacturer containing those interchangeable parts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The lines, and the major parts of the passenger motor vehicles in those lines, that are to be subject to the standard may be selected by agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary. If the manufacturer and the Secretary disagree on the selection, the Secretary shall select the lines and parts, after notice to the manufacturer and opportunity for written comment, and subject to the confidentiality requirements of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall prescribe reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection is made at least 6 months before the first applicable model year beginning after the selection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A manufacturer may not be required to comply with the standard under a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection for a model year beginning earlier than 6 months after the date of the selection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A passenger motor vehicle line subject on October 25, 1992, to parts marking requirements under sections 602 and 603 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92&ndash;513, 86 Stat. 947), as added by section 101(a) of the Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;547, 98 Stat. 2756), continues to be subject to the requirements of this section and section 33102 of this title unless the line is exempted under section 33106 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determining Theft Rate for Passenger Vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;new passenger motor vehicle thefts&rdquo;, when used in reference to a calendar year, means thefts in the United States in that year of passenger motor vehicles with the same model-year designation as that calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under subsection (a) of this section, the theft rate for passenger motor vehicles of a line shall be determined by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the numerator of which is the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line during the 2-year period referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the denominator of which is the sum of the respective production volumes of all passenger motor vehicles of that line (as reported to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under chapter 329 of this title) that are of model years 1990 and 1991 and are distributed for sale in commerce in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Under subsection (a) of this section, the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts during that 2-year period is the theft rate midway between the highest and the lowest theft rates determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection. If there is an even number of theft rates determined under paragraph (2), the median theft rate is the arithmetic average of the 2 adjoining theft rates midway between the highest and the lowest of those theft rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary periodically shall obtain from the most reliable source accurate and timely theft and recovery information and publish the information for review and comment. To the greatest extent possible, the Secretary shall use theft information reported by United States Government, State, and local police. After publication and opportunity for comment, the Secretary shall use the theft information to determine the median theft rate under this subsection. The Secretary and the Director shall take any necessary actions to improve the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the information, including ensuring that vehicles represented as stolen are really stolen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary periodically (but not more often than once every 2 years) may redetermine and prescribe by regulation the median theft rate under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Providing Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary by regulation shall require each manufacturer to provide information necessary to select under subsection (a)(3) of this section the high theft lines and the major parts to be subject to the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in section 33106 of this title, the Secretary may not make the standard inapplicable to a line that has been subject to the standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may grant an exemption&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for model year 1987, for not more than 2 lines of a manufacturer;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:633 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for each of the model years 1988&ndash;1996, for not more than 2 additional lines of a manufacturer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this section are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to prevent or discourage the theft of motor vehicles, particularly those stolen for the removal of certain parts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to prevent or discourage the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of used parts that are removed from those vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to help reduce the cost to consumers of comprehensive insurance coverage for motor vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; includes a person (except a governmental authority) having a fleet of at least 20 motor vehicles that are used primarily for rental or lease and are not covered by a theft insurance policy issued by an insurer of passenger motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; includes a truck, a multipurpose passenger vehicle, and a motorcycle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Annual Information Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An insurer providing comprehensive coverage for motor vehicles shall provide annually to the Secretary of Transportation information on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the thefts and recoveries (in any part) of motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the number of vehicles that have been recovered intact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the rating rules and plans, such as loss information and rating characteristics, used by the insurer to establish premiums for comprehensive coverage, including the basis for the premiums, and premium penalties for motor vehicles considered by the insurer as more likely to be stolen;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the actions taken by the insurer to reduce the premiums, including changing rate levels for comprehensive coverage because of a reduction in thefts of motor vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the actions taken by the insurer to assist in deterring or reducing thefts of motor vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) other information the Secretary requires to carry out this chapter and to make the report and findings required by this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The information on thefts and recoveries shall include an explanation on how the information is obtained, the accuracy and timeliness of the information, and the use made of the information, including the extent and frequency of reporting the information to national, public, and private entities such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State and local police.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Reports on Reduced Claims Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An insurer shall report promptly in writing to the Secretary if the insurer, in paying a claim under an adjustment or negotiation between the insurer and the insured for a stolen motor vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reduces the payment to the insured by the amount of the value, salvage or otherwise, of a recovered part subject to a standard prescribed under section 33102 or 33103 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the reduction is not made at the express election of the insured.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>General Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall exempt from this section, for one or more years, an insurer that the Secretary decides should be exempted because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the cost of preparing and providing the information is excessive in relation to the size of the insurer's business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the information from that insurer will not contribute significantly to carrying out this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Small Insurer Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;small insurer&rdquo; means an insurer whose premiums for motor vehicle insurance issued directly or through an affiliate, including a pooling arrangement established under State law or regulation for the issuance of motor vehicle insurance, account for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) less than 10 percent of the total premiums for all forms of motor vehicle insurance issued by insurers in any State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall exempt by regulation a small insurer from this section if the Secretary finds that the exemption will not significantly affect the validity or usefulness of the information collected and compiled under this section, nationally or State-by-State. However, the Secretary may not exempt an insurer under this paragraph that is considered an insurer only because of subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations under this subsection shall provide that eligibility as a small insurer shall be based on the most recent calendar year for which adequate information is available, and that, once attained, the eligibility shall continue without further demonstration of eligibility for one or more years, as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Prescribed Form</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Information required by this section shall be provided in the form the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Periodic Compilations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to section 552 of title 5, the Secretary periodically shall compile and publish information obtained by the Secretary under this section, in a form that will be helpful to the public, the police, and Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall consult with public and private agencies and associations the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Penalty and Civil Actions To Collect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person that violates section 33114(a)(1)&ndash;(4) of this title is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each violation. The failure of more than one part of a single motor vehicle to conform to an applicable standard under section 33102 or 33103 of this title is only a single violation. The maximum penalty under this subsection for a related series of violations is $250,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation imposes a civil penalty under this subsection. The Secretary may compromise the amount of a penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining the amount of a civil penalty or compromise under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the size of the person's business and the gravity of the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Attorney General shall bring a civil action in a United States district court to collect a civil penalty imposed under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Government may deduct the amount of a civil penalty imposed or compromised under this subsection from amounts it owes the person liable for the penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Chop Shop Penalty and Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person that violates section 33114(a)(5) of this title is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of not more than $100,000 a day for each violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As appropriate and in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) bring a civil action for a temporary or permanent injunction to restrain a person violating section 33114(a)(5) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) impose and recover the penalty described in paragraph (1) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take both the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Enforce</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Attorney General may bring a civil action in a United States district court to enjoin a violation of this chapter or the sale, offer for sale, introduction or delivery for introduction in interstate commerce, or importation into the United States, of a passenger motor vehicle containing a major part, or of a major replacement part, that is subject to the standard and is determined before the sale of the vehicle or part to a first purchaser not to conform to the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When practicable, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall notify a person against whom an action under this subsection is planned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall give the person an opportunity to present that person's views; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) except for a knowing and willful violation, shall give the person a reasonable opportunity to comply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The failure of the Secretary to comply with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph does not prevent a court from granting appropriate relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Jury Trial Demand</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a trial for criminal contempt for violating an injunction or restraining order issued under subsection (c) of this section, the violation of which is also a violation of this chapter, the defendant may demand a jury trial. The defendant shall be tried as provided in rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 App. U.S.C.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Venue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil action under subsection (a) or (c) of this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the violation occurred or the defendant resides, is found, or transacts business. Process in the action may be served in any other judicial district in which the defendant resides or is found. A subpena for a witness in the action may be served in any judicial district.</p>
