<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Development of Transportation Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is in the interest of the United States to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems that embrace various modes of transportation and efficiently maximize mobility of individuals and goods in and through urbanized areas and minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) more than 70 percent of the population of the United States is located in rapidly expanding urban areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into at least 2 States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the welfare and vitality of urban areas, the satisfactory movement of people and goods within those areas, and the effectiveness of programs aided by the United States Government are jeopardized by deteriorating or inadequate urban transportation service and facilities, the intensification of traffic congestion, and the lack of coordinated, comprehensive, and continuing development planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) transportation is the lifeblood of an urbanized society, and the health and welfare of an urbanized society depend on providing efficient, economical, and convenient transportation in and between urban areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for many years the mass transportation industry capably and profitably satisfied the transportation needs of the urban areas of the United States but in the early 1970's continuing even minimal mass transportation service in urban areas was threatened because maintaining that transportation service was financially burdensome;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ending that transportation, or the continued increase in its cost to the user, is undesirable and may affect seriously and adversely the welfare of a substantial number of lower income individuals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) some urban areas were developing preliminary plans for, or carrying out, projects in the early 1970's to revitalize their mass transportation operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) significant mass transportation improvements are necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, international competitiveness, and mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals in urban and rural areas of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) financial assistance by the Government to develop efficient and coordinated mass transportation systems is essential to solve the urban transportation problems referred to in clause (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) immediate substantial assistance by the Government is needed to enable mass transportation systems to continue providing vital transportation service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rapid Urbanization and Continuing Population Dispersal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Rapid urbanization and continuing dispersal of the population and activities in urban areas have made the ability of all citizens to move quickly and at a reasonable cost an urgent problem of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Elderly Individuals and Individuals With Disabilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Government that elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities have the same right as other individuals to use mass transportation service and facilities. Special efforts shall be made in <!-- PDFPage:142 -->planning and designing mass transportation service and facilities to ensure that mass transportation can be used by elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities. All programs of the Government assisting mass transportation shall carry out this policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Preserving the Environment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Government that special effort shall be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside, public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and important historical and cultural assets when planning, designing, and carrying out an urban mass transportation capital project with assistance from the Government under sections 5309 and 5310 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>General Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assist in developing improved mass transportation equipment, facilities, techniques, and methods with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the planning and establishment of areawide urban mass transportation systems needed for economical and desirable urban development with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to assist States and local governments and their authorities in financing areawide urban mass transportation systems that are to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies as decided by local needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide financial assistance to State and local governments and their authorities to help carry out national goals related to mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish a partnership that allows a community, with financial assistance from the Government, to satisfy its urban mass transportation requirements.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Contracting Out Study</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 105&ndash;178, title III, &sect;3032, June 9, 1998, 112 Stat. 385, as amended by Pub. L. 105&ndash;206, title IX, &sect;9009(v), July 22, 1998, 112 Stat. 861, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [June 9, 1998], the Secretary [of Transportation] shall enter into an agreement with the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of the effect of contracting out mass transportation operation and administrative functions on cost, availability and level of service, efficiency, safety, quality of services provided to transit-dependent populations, and employer-employee relations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Terms of Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agreement entered into in subsection (a) shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Transportation Research Board, in conducting the study, consider the number of grant recipients that have contracted out services, the size of the population served by such grant recipients, the basis for decisions regarding contracting out, and the extent to which contracting out was affected by the integration and coordination of resources of transit agencies and other Federal agencies and programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the panel conducting the study shall include representatives of transit agencies, employees of <!-- PDFPage:143 -->transit agencies, private contractors, academic and policy analysts, and other interested persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 24 months after the date of entry into the agreement under subsection (a), the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a report containing the results of the study.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There shall be available from funds made available under section 5338(f)(2) of title 49, United States Code, to carry out this section $250,000 for fiscal year 1999.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Contractual Obligation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Entry into an agreement to carry out this section that is financed with amounts made available under subsection (d) is a contractual obligation of the United States to pay the Government's share of the cost of the study.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Commute-to-Work Benefits</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;240, title VIII, &sect;8004, Dec. 18, 1991, 105 Stat. 2206, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) current Federal policy places commuter transit benefits at a disadvantage compared to drive-to-work benefits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) this Federal policy is inconsistent with important national policy objectives, including the need to conserve energy, reduce reliance on energy imports, lessen congestion, and clean our Nation's air;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) commuter transit benefits should be part of a comprehensive solution to national transportation and air pollution problems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) current Federal law allows employers to provide only up to $21 per month in employee benefits for transit or van pools;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the current &lsquo;cliff provision&rsquo;, which treats an entire commuter transit benefit as taxable income if it exceeds $21 per month, unduly penalizes the most effective employer efforts to change commuter behavior;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) employer-provided commuter transit incentives offer many public benefits, including increased access of low-income persons to good jobs, inexpensive reduction of roadway and parking congestion, and cost-effective incentives for timely arrival at work; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) legislation to provide equitable treatment of employer-provided commuter transit benefits has been introduced with bipartisan support in both the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>

The amount shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment when a letter is issued for a fixed guideway project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least 60 days before issuing a letter under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or entering into a full funding grant agreement, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify in writing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations of the proposed letter or agreement. The Secretary shall include with the notification a copy of the proposed letter or agreement as well as the evaluations and ratings for the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The issuance of a letter is deemed not to be an obligation under sections 1108(c) and (d), 1501, and 1502(a) of title 31 or an administrative commitment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only when amounts are appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may make a full funding grant agreement with an applicant. The agreement shall&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and may include a commitment, contingent on amounts to be specified in law in advance for commitments under this paragraph, to obligate an additional amount from future available budget authority specified in law. The agreement shall state that the contingent commitment is not an obligation of the Government. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out a part of the project within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the project under a full funding grant agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. The amount stipulated in an agreement under this paragraph for a fixed guideway project shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may make an early systems work agreement with an applicant if a record of decision under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) has been issued on the project and the Secretary finds there is reason to believe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a full funding grant agreement for the project will be made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the terms of the work agreement will promote ultimate completion of the project more rapidly and at less cost.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A work agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget author<!-- PDFPage:167 -->ity specified in law and shall provide for reimbursement of preliminary costs of carrying out the project, including land acquisition, timely procurement of system elements for which specifications are decided, and other activities the Secretary of Transportation decides are appropriate to make efficient, long-term project management easier. A work agreement shall cover the period of time the Secretary considers appropriate. The period may extend beyond the period of current authorization. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out the work agreement within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. If an applicant does not carry out the project for reasons within the control of the applicant, the applicant shall repay all Government payments made under the work agreement plus reasonable interest and penalty charges the Secretary establishes in the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The total estimated amount of future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments to incur obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent, full funding grant agreements, and early systems work agreements may be not more than the greater of the amount authorized under section 5338(b) of this title for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems and the amount appropriated under section 5338(h)(5) or an amount equivalent to the last 2 fiscal years of funding authorized under section 5338(b) for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems, less an amount the Secretary of Transportation reasonably estimates is necessary for grants under this section not covered by a letter. The total amount covered by new letters and contingent commitments included in full funding grant agreements and early systems work agreements may be not more than a limitation specified in law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For fiscal year 2001 and thereafter, the amount equivalent to the last 2 fiscal years of funding authorized under section 5338(b) for new fixed guideway systems and extensions to existing fixed guideway systems referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be the amount equivalent to the last 3 fiscal years of such authorized funding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any increase in the total estimated amount of future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments to incur obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent, full funding grant agreements, and early systems work agreements as a result of application of subparagraph (B) instead of subparagraph (A) shall be available as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $269,100,000 for the Chicago, Illinois Metra commuter rail project, that consists of the following elements: the Kane County extension; the North Central double-tracking project; and the Southwest corridor extension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) $565,600,000 for the Chicago Transit Authority project that consists of the following elements: Ravenswood Branch station and line improvements and the Douglas Branch reconstruction project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) Any amount that would be available under subparagraph (A) if subparagraph (B) were not in effect and would have otherwise been allocated by the Federal Transit Administration to those projects referred to in subparagraphs (C)(1) and (C)(2), shall not be available for allocation by the department or for making future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments until April 1, 2001, except for those projects referred to in subparagraph (D)(1) and (D)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments made against the contingent commitment authority under section 3032(g)(2) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 for the San Francisco BART to the Airport project for fiscal years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 shall be charged against section 3032(g)(2) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Any amount that would be available under subparagraph (A) if subparagraph (F) were not in effect and would otherwise have been allocated by the Federal Transit Administration to the project in subparagraph (F) shall not be available for allocation by the department or for making future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments until April 1, 2001.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Government's Share of Net Project Cost</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Based on engineering studies, studies of economic feasibility, and information on the expected use of equipment or facilities, the Secretary of Transportation shall estimate the net project cost. A grant for the project is for 80 percent of the net project cost, unless the grant recipient requests a lower grant percentage. The remainder shall be provided in cash from a source other than amounts of the Government. Transit system amounts that make up the remainder must be from an undistributed cash surplus, a replacement or depreciation cash fund <!-- PDFPage:168 -->or reserve, or new capital. The remainder for a planned extension to a fixed guideway system may include the cost of rolling stock previously purchased if the applicant satisfies the Secretary that only amounts other than amounts of the Government were used and that the purchase was made for use on the extension. A refund or reduction of the remainder may be made only if a refund of a proportional amount of the grant of the Government is made at the same time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Loan Term Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except for a loan under subsection (b) of this section, a loan, including a renewal or extension of the loan, may be made, and a security or obligation may be bought, only if it has a maturity date of not more than 40 years. Interest on a loan may not be less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a rate the Secretary of the Treasury establishes, considering the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the Government that have remaining periods of maturity comparable to the average maturity of the loan, adjusted to the nearest .125 percent; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an allowance the Secretary of Transportation considers adequate to cover administrative costs and probable losses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Loan Payment Forgiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A grant agreement for a capital project may forgive repaying the loan and interest in place of a cash grant for the amount forgiven. The amount is part of the grant and part of the contribution of the Government to the cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Making Loans and Grants for Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may not make a loan under this section for a project for which a grant (except a relocation payment grant) is made under this section. However, the Secretary may make a project grant even though real property for the project has been or will be acquired through a loan under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) <cap-smallcap>Fiscal Capacity Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Transportation gives priority consideration to financing projects that include more than the non-Government share required under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary shall give equal consideration to differences in the fiscal capacity of State and local governments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) support a procurement that uses an exclusionary or discriminatory specification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Government Share of Costs for Certain Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A grant for a project to be assisted under this chapter that involves acquiring vehicle-related equipment required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) or vehicle-related equipment (including clean fuel or alternative fuel vehicle-related equipment) for purposes of complying with or maintaining compliance with the Clean Air Act, is for 90 percent of the net project cost of such equipment attributable to compliance with those Acts.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has violated the agreement by discriminating against goods to which this subsection applies that are produced in the United States and to which the agreement applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A person is ineligible under subpart 9.4 of chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, to receive a contract or subcontract made with amounts authorized under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 1914) if a court or department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government decides the person intentionally&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Opportunity to correct inadvertent error</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may allow a manufacturer or supplier of steel, iron, or manufactured goods to correct after bid opening any certification of noncompliance or failure to properly complete the certification (but not including failure to sign the certification) under this subsection if such manufacturer or supplier attests under penalty of perjury that such manufacturer or supplier submitted an incorrect certification as a result of an inadvertent or clerical error.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Testing Program for Mass Transportation Employees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In the interest of mass transportation safety, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations that establish a program requiring mass transportation operations that receive financial assistance under section 5307, 5309, or 5311 of this title or section 103(e)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5331_1_target" name="5331_1">1</a></sup> of title 23 to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of mass transportation employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) for the use of a controlled substance in violation of law or a United States Government regulation, and to conduct reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of such employees for the use of alcohol in violation of law or a United States Government regulation. The regulations shall permit such operations to conduct preemployment testing of such employees for the use of alcohol.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When the Secretary of Transportation considers it appropriate in the interest of safety, the Secretary may prescribe regulations for conducting periodic recurring testing of mass transportation employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall require that post-accident testing of such a mass transportation employee be conducted when loss of human life occurs in an accident involving mass transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may require that post-accident testing of such a mass transportation employee be conducted when bodily injury or significant property damage occurs in any other serious accident involving mass transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Disqualifications for Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When the Secretary of Transportation considers it appropriate, the Secretary shall require disqualification for an established period of time or dismissal of any employee referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section who is found&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to have used or been impaired by alcohol when on duty; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not supersede any penalty applicable to a mass transportation employee under another law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Testing and Laboratory Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall develop requirements that shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote, to the maximum extent practicable, individual privacy in the collection of specimens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for laboratories and testing procedures for controlled substances, incorporate the Department of Health and Human Services scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11, 1988, and any amendments to those guidelines, including mandatory guidelines establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comprehensive standards for every aspect of laboratory controlled substances testing and laboratory procedures to be applied in carrying out this section, including standards requiring the use of the best available technology to ensure the complete reliability and accuracy of controlled substances tests and strict procedures governing the chain of custody of specimens collected for controlled substances testing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the minimum list of controlled substances for which individuals may be tested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) appropriate standards and procedures for periodic review of laboratories and criteria for certification and revocation of certification of laboratories to perform controlled substances testing in carrying out this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:200 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require that a laboratory involved in controlled substances testing under this section have the capability and facility, at the laboratory, of performing screening and confirmation tests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that all tests indicating the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable of providing quantitative information about alcohol or a controlled substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the confidentiality of test results and medical information (except information about alcohol or a controlled substance) of employees, except that this clause does not prevent the use of test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions under this section; and</p>

The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which employees shall be required to participate in a program. This subsection does not prevent a mass transportation operation from establishing a program under this section in cooperation with another mass transportation operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to Other Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State or local government may not prescribe, issue, or continue in effect a law, regulation, standard, or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this section. However, a regulation prescribed under this section does not preempt a State criminal law that imposes sanctions for reckless conduct leading to loss of life, injury, or damage to property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall establish only requirements that are consistent with international obligations of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall consider applicable laws and regulations of foreign countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section does not prevent the Secretary of Transportation from continuing in effect, amending, or further supplementing a regulation prescribed before October 28, 1991, governing the use of alcohol or a controlled substance by mass transportation employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Ineligibility for Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person is not eligible for financial assistance under section 5307, 5309, or 5311 of this title or section 103(e)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5331_2_target" name="5331_2">2</a></sup> of title 23 if the person is required, under regulations the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under this section, to establish a program of alcohol and controlled substances testing and does not establish the program.</p>

However, this subsection does not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) deprive a State or political subdivision of a State of jurisdiction of the property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) impair the civil rights, under the laws of a State or political subdivision of a State, of an inhabitant of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Assets No Longer Needed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a recipient of assistance under this chapter decides an asset acquired under this chapter at least in part with that assistance is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was acquired, the Secretary of Transportation may authorize the recipient to transfer the asset to a local governmental authority to be used for a public purpose with no further obligation to the Government. The Secretary may authorize a transfer for a public purpose other than mass transportation only if the Secretary decides&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is no purpose eligible for assistance under this chapter for which the asset should be used;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the overall benefit of allowing the transfer is greater than the interest of the Government in liquidation and return of the financial interest of the Government in the asset, after considering fair market value and other factors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) through an appropriate screening or survey process, that there is no interest in acquiring the asset for Government use if the asset is a facility or land.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A decision under paragraph (1) of this section must be in writing and include the reason for the decision.</p>
