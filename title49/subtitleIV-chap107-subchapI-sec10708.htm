<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10708. Investigation and suspension of new nonrail carrier rates, classifications, rules, and practices</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin a proceeding to determine the lawfulness of a proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice immediately, on its own initiative or on application of an interested party when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a new individual or joint rate or individual or joint classification, rule, or practice affecting a rate is filed with the Commission by a common carrier, other than a rail carrier, under this subtitle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a new or reduced rate or rule or practice that causes a reduction of a rate is filed with the Commission by a contract carrier under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission must give reasonable notice before beginning a proceeding under this section but may act without allowing an interested carrier to file an answer or other formal pleading in response to its decision to begin the proceeding. The Commission may take whatever final action on a rate, classification, rule, or practice under this section, after a full hearing (whether completed before or after the rate, classification, rule, or practices goes into effect), as it could in a proceeding begun after a rate, �7E�7Eclassification, �7E�7Erule, �7E�7Eor �7E�7Epractice �7E�7Ebecame effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Pending final Commission action in a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may suspend the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice at any time for not more than 7 months beyond the time it would otherwise go into effect by (1) delivering to each affected carrier, and (2) filing with the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice, a statement of reasons for the suspension. If the Commission does not take final action during the suspension period, the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice is effective at the end of that period. However, if an increase in a rate for, or related to, transportation of property by an express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier becomes effective under this subsection, the Commission may require the interested carrier to account for all amounts received under it and specify by whom and on whose behalf those amounts were paid. When the Commission takes final action, it may require the carrier to refund, with interest, to the persons on whose behalf those amounts were paid, the part of the increased rate found to be in violation of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In a proceeding under this section, the burden is on the carrier proposing the changed rate, classification, rule, or practice to prove that the change is reasonable. The Commission shall give proceedings under this section preference over all other proceedings related to that type of carrier pending before it and make its decision at the earliest practical time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of property or household goods freight forwarder on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier notifies the Commission that it wishes to have the rate considered pursuant to this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate is not more than 10 percent above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, nor more than 10 percent below the lesser of the rate in effect on July 1, 1980 (or, in the case of any rate which a carrier first establishes after July 1, 1980, for a service not provided by such carrier on such date, such rate on the date such rate first becomes effective), or the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule, may increase the percentages specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection for any group of motor common car<!-- PDFPage:246 -->riers of property or household goods freight forwarders if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there is sufficient actual and potential competition to regulate rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there are benefits to (i) carriers or household goods freight forwarders, (ii) shippers, and (iii) the public from further rate flexibility;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the Commission may not increase such percentages by more than 5 percentage points during any one-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In determining, pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, whether the aggregate of increases and decreases in a proposed rate that is to take effect on or before the 730th day following the date of enactment of this paragraph is more than 10 percent (or such other percentage as the Commission may establish under paragraph (2) of this subsection) above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, general rate increases obtained in the one-year period prior to the effective date of the proposed rate shall not be included in such aggregate, except to the extent that such general rate increases exceed 5 percent of the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a proposed rate that is to take effect after the 730th day following the date of enactment of this paragraph, the percentage which first appears in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection (relating to the upper limit of the zone of ratemaking freedom), or such other percentage as the Commission may establish under paragraph (2) of this subsection in lieu of such percentage, shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the percentage change in the Producers Price Index, as published by the Department of Labor, that has occurred during the one-year period prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers, or joint rate proposed by one or more such carriers, applicable to any transportation (other than special or charter transportation) on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier or carriers notify the Commission that they wish to have the rate considered pursuant to this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate is not more than 10 percent above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, nor more than 20 percent below the lesser of the rate in effect on the effective date of this paragraph (or, in case of any rate which the carrier or carriers first establish after such date for a service not provided by the carrier or carriers on such date, such rate on the date such rate first becomes effective), or the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) One year after the effective date of this paragraph, the first and second percentages specified in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection shall change to 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Two years after the effective date, the first and second percentages specified in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection shall change to 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any rate implemented by a carrier pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), except that the docketing and publication of such rate by the carrier under section 10706(b) of this title shall not be construed as a violation of the antitrust laws. Evidence that any motor common carrier of passengers established pursuant to this subsection a joint or single-line rate applicable to transportation over any route which is the same as or similar to a joint rate applicable to transportation over such route which such carrier together with one or more other motor common carriers of passengers established pursuant to this subsection shall not be in and of itself sufficient to establish a violation of any such antitrust law. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates on the basis that such rates may violate the provisions of section 10741 of this title or constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, 3 years after the effective date of this subsection, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low, unless the proposed rate is established collectively in accordance with the procedures of an agreement approved by the Commission under section 10706(b) of this title. In publishing and filing a tariff under section 10762 of this title, the carrier shall disclose whether such rate is the result of collective ratemaking procedures pursuant to an agreement approved by the Commission under section 10706(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an interested party may file a complaint under section 11701 of this title challenging the reasonableness of a rate filed under this section by a motor carrier of passengers. Any such complaint proceeding shall be finally determined by the Commission no later than 90 days after the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers applicable to special or charter transportation. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates on the basis that such rates constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section restates and consolidates the source provisions for clarity. The word &ldquo;schedule&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rate, fare, or charge&rdquo; in view of the definition of &ldquo;rate&rdquo; in section 10102 of this revised title. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;shall have, and it is given, authority,&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;without complaint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it so orders&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;begin a proceeding&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to enter upon a hearing&rdquo; in view of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. The words &ldquo;suspend the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;suspend the operation of schedule and defer the use of such rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;by order .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by further order&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;after September 18, 1940&rdquo; in 49:15(7), and &ldquo;(except a schedule referred to in section 922 of this title)&rdquo; in 49:907(g) and 907(i) are omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;in violation of this subtitle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;unjustified&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;shall give proceeding under this section preference over all other proceedings related to that type of carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over all other questions pending&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;at the earliest practical time&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as speedily as possible&rdquo; for consistency.
