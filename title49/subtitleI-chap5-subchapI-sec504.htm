<p class="note-body">The section is included because 49:1655(f)(2) gave the same administrative powers exercised by the Interstate Commerce Commission under certain sections of title 49 to the Secretary of Transportation to carry out duties transferred to the Secretary by 49:1655(e). See the revision notes for section 501 of the revised title for an explanation of the transfer under 49:1655(f)(2). The powers of the Commission have been codified in subtitle IV of the revised title. The comparable provisions of title 49 that are represented by the section may be found as follows:</p>

<p class="note-body">See the revision notes for the revised sections for an explanation of changes made in the text. Changes not accounted for in those revision notes are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of 49:320(c) are not included for motor carriers of migrant workers and motor private carriers because those provisions, while included in the enumeration in 49:304(a)(3) and (3a), are not included in the specific enumeration of 49:1655(f)(2)(B)(ii).</p>
<p class="note-body">In the section, the text of 49:304(a)(3) (last sentence 1st&ndash;7th words) and (3a) (last sentence 1st&ndash;5th words) is omitted as executed. The text of 49:320(b) (related to 13-period accounting year) and (g) is not included because it was enacted after the effective date of the transfer authority under 49:1655.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), references to &ldquo;water line&rdquo; and &ldquo;pipe line&rdquo; are omitted as not applicable to this chapter. Clause (2) is added to provide a simple phrase to refer to all types of carriers to which the section applies.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &ldquo;the course of the&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;civil action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;suit or action&rdquo; because of rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.).</p>
