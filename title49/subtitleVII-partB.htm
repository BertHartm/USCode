<h3 class="section-head">&sect;47101. Policies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the safe operation of the airport and airway system is the highest aviation priority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that aviation facilities be constructed and operated to minimize current and projected noise impact on nearby communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to give special emphasis to developing reliever airports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that appropriate provisions should be made to make the development and enhancement of cargo hub airports easier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to encourage the development of transportation systems that use various modes of transportation in a way that will serve the States and local communities efficiently and effectively;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) that airport development projects under this subchapter provide for the protection and enhancement of natural resources and the quality of the environment of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that airport construction and improvement projects that increase the capacity of facilities to accommodate passenger and cargo traffic be undertaken to the maximum feasible extent so that safety and efficiency increase and delays decrease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to ensure that nonaviation usage of the navigable airspace be accommodated but not allowed to decrease the safety and capacity of the airspace and airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) that artificial restrictions on airport capacity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are not in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) should be imposed to alleviate air traffic delays only after other reasonably available and less burdensome alternatives have been tried; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) should not discriminate unjustly between categories and classes of aircraft;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) that special emphasis should be placed on converting appropriate former military air bases to civil use and identifying and improving additional joint-use facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology, concepts, and approaches that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system (including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of airport facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability) and to encourage and solicit innovative technology proposals and activities in the expenditure of funding pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) that airports should be as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at each particular airport and in establishing new fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>National Transportation Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It is a goal of the United States to develop a national intermodal transportation system that transports passengers and property in an efficient manner. The future economic direction of the United States depends on its ability to confront directly the enormous challenges of the global economy, declining productivity growth, energy vulnerability, air pollution, and the need to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) United States leadership in the world economy, the expanding wealth of the United States, the competitiveness of the industry of the United States, the standard of living, and the quality of life are at stake.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A national intermodal transportation system is a coordinated, flexible network of diverse but complementary forms of transportation that transports passengers and property in the most efficient manner. By reducing transportation costs, these intermodal systems will enhance the ability of the industry of the United States to compete in the global marketplace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All forms of transportation, including aviation and other transportation systems of the future, will be full partners in the effort to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An intermodal transportation system consists of transportation hubs that connect different forms of appropriate transportation and provides users with the most efficient means of transportation and with access to commercial centers, business locations, population centers, and the vast rural areas of the United States, as well as providing links to other forms of transportation and to intercity connections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Intermodality and flexibility are paramount issues in the process of developing an integrated system that will obtain the optimum yield of United States resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The United States transportation infrastructure must be reshaped to provide the economic underpinnings for the United States to compete in the 21st century global economy. The United States can no longer rely on the sheer size of its economy to dominate international economic rivals and must recognize fully that its economy is no longer a separate entity but is part of the global marketplace. The future economic prosperity of the United States depends on its ability to compete in an inter<!-- PDFPage:787 -->national marketplace that is teeming with competitors but in which a full one-quarter of the economic activity of the United States takes place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The United States must make a national commitment to rebuild its infrastructure through development of a national intermodal transportation system. The United States must provide the foundation for its industries to improve productivity and their ability to compete in the global economy with a system that will transport passengers and property in an efficient manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Capacity Expansion and Noise Abatement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is in the public interest to recognize the effects of airport capacity expansion projects on aircraft noise. Efforts to increase capacity through any means can have an impact on surrounding communities. Noncompatible land uses around airports must be reduced and efforts to mitigate noise must be given a high priority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consistency With Air Commerce and Safety Policies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each airport and airway program should be carried out consistently with section 40101(a), (b), (d), and (f) of this title to foster competition, prevent unfair methods of competition in air transportation, maintain essential air transportation, and prevent unjust and discriminatory practices, including as the practices may be applied between categories and classes of aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Adequacy of Navigation Aids and Airport Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out to provide adequate navigation aids and airport facilities for places at which scheduled commercial air service is provided. The facilities provided may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) heliports designated by the Secretary of Transportation to relieve congestion at commercial service airports by diverting aircraft passengers from fixed-wing aircraft to helicopter carriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Use of Safety Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out consistently with a comprehensive airspace system plan, giving highest priority to commercial service airports, to maximize the use of safety facilities, including installing, operating, and maintaining, to the extent possible with available money and considering other safety needs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) electronic or visual vertical guidance on each runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) grooving or friction treatment of each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) distance-to-go signs for each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a precision approach system, a vertical visual guidance system, and a full approach light system for each primary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a nonprecision instrument approach for each secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) runway end identifier lights on each runway that does not have an approach light system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a surface movement radar system at each category III airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a taxiway lighting and sign system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) runway edge lighting and marking; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) radar approach coverage for each airport terminal area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate with State and local officials in developing airport plans and programs that are based on overall transportation needs. The airport plans and programs shall be developed in coordination with other transportation planning and considering comprehensive long-range land-use plans and overall social, economic, environmental, system performance, and energy conservation objectives. The process of developing airport plans and programs shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive to the degree appropriate to the complexity of the transportation problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(6) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency about any project included in a project grant application involving the location of an airport or runway, or a major runway extension, that may have a significant effect on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) natural resources, including fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) natural, scenic, and recreation assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) water and air quality; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) another factor affecting the environment.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, before clause (1), the words &ldquo;In this subchapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;As used in this chapter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whenever in this chapter reference is made to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such reference shall mean&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (1) restates the definition of &ldquo;air carrier airport&rdquo; that was contained in section 11(1) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 as in effect both on February 18, 1980, and immediately before September 3, 1982. The clause is added to this section to eliminate the cross-references to definitions in section 11 of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 that are contained in the source provisions restated in sections 47106(d) and 47119(a) of the revised title. Because some of the terms used in the definition of &ldquo;air carrier airport&rdquo; were themselves defined in section 11, the definitions of those terms are incorporated in the definition added in clause (1) to the extent they differ from the definitions of those terms restated in this section.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After making a project grant agreement under this subchapter and consulting with the sponsor, the Secretary of Transportation may decide when and in what amounts payments under the agreement will be made. Payments totaling not more than 90 percent of the United States Government's share of the project's estimated allowable costs may be made before the project is completed if the sponsor certifies to the Secretary that the total amount expended from the advance payments at any time will not be more than the cost of the airport development work completed on the project at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Recovering Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines that the total amount of payments made under a grant agreement under this subchapter is more than the Government's share of the total allowable project costs, the Government may recover the excess amount. If the Secretary finds that a project for which an advance payment was made has not been completed within a reasonable time, the Government may recover any part of the advance payment for which the Government received no benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment Deposits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A payment under a project grant agreement under this subchapter may be made only to an official or depository designated by the sponsor and authorized by law to receive public money.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Withholding Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may withhold a payment under a grant agreement under this subchapter for more than 180 days after the payment is due only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notifies the sponsor and provides an opportunity for a hearing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finds that the sponsor has violated the agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The 180-day period may be extended by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) agreement of the Secretary and the sponsor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the hearing officer if the officer decides an extension is necessary because the sponsor did not follow the schedule the officer established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person adversely affected by an order of the Secretary withholding a payment may apply for review of the order by filing a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the project is located. The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is served on the petitioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Action on Grant Assurances Concerning Airport Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds a violation of section 47107(b) of this title, as further defined by the Secretary under section 47107(<em>l</em>) of this title, or a violation of an assurance made under section 47107(b) of this title, and the Secretary has provided an opportunity for the airport sponsor to take corrective action to cure such violation, and such corrective action has not been taken within the period of time set by the Secretary, the Secretary shall withhold approval of any new grant application for funds under this chapter, or any proposed modification to an existing grant that would increase the amount of funds made available under this chapter to the airport sponsor, and withhold approval of any new application to impose a fee under section 40117 of this title. Such applications may thereafter be approved only upon a finding by the Secretary that such corrective action as the Secretary requires has been taken to address the violation and that the violation no longer exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any violation of this chapter or any grant assurance made under this chapter, the Secretary may apply to the district court of the United States for any district in which the violation occurred for enforcement. Such court shall have jurisdiction to enforce obedience thereto by a writ of injunction or other process, mandatory or otherwise, restraining any person from further violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Apportionment Date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the first day of each fiscal year, the Secretary of Transportation shall apportion the amount subject to apportionment for that fiscal year as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Amounts Apportioned to Sponsors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) The Secretary shall apportion to the sponsor of each primary airport for each fiscal year an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) $.65 for each additional passenger boarding at the airport during the prior calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not less than $500,000 nor more than $22,000,000 may be apportioned under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to an airport sponsor for a primary airport for each fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall apportion to the sponsors of airports served by aircraft providing air transportation of only cargo with a total annual landed weight of more than 100,000,000 pounds for each fiscal year an amount equal to 3.5 percent of the amount subject to apportionment each year, allocated among those airports in the proportion that the total annual landed weight of those aircraft landing at each of those airports bears to the total annual landed weight of those aircraft landing at all those airports. However, not more than 8 percent of the amount apportioned under this paragraph may be apportioned for any one airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Landed weight under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is the landed weight of aircraft landing at each of those airports and all those airports during the prior calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the total of all amounts apportioned under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection may not be more than 49.5 percent of the amount subject to apportionment for a fiscal year. If this subparagraph requires reduction of an amount that otherwise would be apportioned under this subsection, the Secretary shall reduce proportionately the amount apportioned to each sponsor of an airport under paragraphs <!-- PDFPage:810 -->(1) and (2) until the 49.5 percent limit is achieved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a law limits the amount subject to apportionment to less than $1,900,000,000 for a fiscal year, the total of all amounts apportioned under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection may not be more than 44 percent of the amount subject to apportionment for that fiscal year. If this subparagraph requires reduction of an amount that otherwise would be apportioned under this subsection, the Secretary shall reduce proportionately the amount apportioned to each sponsor of an airport under paragraphs (1) and (2) until the 44 percent limit is achieved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) one percent of the apportioned amount to Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, 49.5 percent of the apportioned amount for airports, except primary airports and airports described in section 47117(e)(1)(C) of this title, in States not named in clause (A) of this paragraph in the proportion that the population of each of those States bears to the total population of all of those States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, 49.5 percent of the apportioned amount for airports, except primary airports and airports described in section 47117(e)(1)(C) of this title, in States not named in clause (A) of this paragraph in the proportion that the area of each of those States bears to the total area of all of those States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An amount apportioned under paragraph (2) of this subsection for an airport in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Alaska may be made available by the Secretary for a public airport described in section 47117(e)(1)(C)(ii) of this title to which section 15(a)(3)(A)(II) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 applied during the fiscal year that ended September 30, 1981; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Puerto Rico may be made available by the Secretary for a primary airport and an airport described in section 47117(e)(1)(C) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Alternative Apportionment for Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Instead of apportioning amounts for airports in Alaska under subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the Secretary may apportion amounts for those airports in the way in which amounts were apportioned in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, under section 15(a) of the Act. However, in apportioning amounts for a fiscal year under this subsection, the Secretary shall apportion&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for each primary airport at least as much as would be apportioned for the airport under subsection (c)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a total amount at least equal to the minimum amount required to be apportioned to airports in Alaska in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, under section 15(a)(3)(A) of the Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not prohibit the Secretary from making project grants for airports in Alaska from the discretionary fund under section 47115 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Airports referred to in this subsection include those public airports that received scheduled service as of September 3, 1982, but were not apportioned amounts in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, under section 15(a) of the Act because the airports were not under the control of a State or local public agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Reducing Apportionments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount that would be apportioned under this section (except subsection (c)(2)) in a fiscal year to the sponsor of an airport having at least .25 percent of the total number of boardings each year in the United States and for which a fee is imposed in the fiscal year under section 40117 of this title shall be reduced by an amount equal to 50 percent of the projected revenues from the fee in the fiscal year but not by more than 50 percent of the amount that otherwise would be apportioned under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Existence and Amounts in Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation has a discretionary fund. The fund consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amounts subject to apportionment for a fiscal year that are not apportioned under section 47114(c)&ndash;(e) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 25 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsection (c) of this section and section 47117(e) of this title, the fund is available for making grants for any purpose for which amounts are made available under section 48103 of this title that the Secretary considers most appropriate to carry out this subchapter. However, 50 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f) and added to the fund is available for making grants for projects at small hub airports (as defined in section 41731 of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Percentage for Primary and Reliever Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 75 percent of the amount in the fund and distributed by the Secretary in a fiscal year shall be used for making grants&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to preserve and enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to carry out airport noise compatibility planning and programs at primary and reliever airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and enhance capacity as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the project benefit and cost; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:812 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport capacity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiving Percentage Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary decides the Secretary cannot comply with the percentage requirement of subsection (c) of this section in a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications to meet that percentage, the amount the Secretary determines will not be distributed as required by subsection (c) is available for obligation during the fiscal year without regard to the requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Diversion of Revenues in Awarding Discretionary Grants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), in deciding whether or not to distribute funds to an airport from the discretionary funds established by subsection (a) of this section and section 47116 of this title, the Secretary shall consider as a factor militating against the distribution of such funds to the airport the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local taxes on aviation fuel for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airports system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport and directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Required finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport's fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport's first fiscal year ending after the date of the enactment of this subsection, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47115_1_target" name="47115_1">1</a></sup> <cap-smallcap>Minimum Amount To Be Credited</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In a fiscal year, at least $325,000,000 of the amount made available under section 48103 of this title shall be credited to the fund. The amount credited is exclusive of amounts that have been apportioned in a prior fiscal year under section 47114 of this title and that remain available for obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a fiscal year in which the amount credited under subsection (a) of this section is less than $325,000,000, the total amount calculated under paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be reduced by an amount that, when credited to the fund, together with the amount credited under subsection (a), equals $325,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a fiscal year, the total amount available to reduce to carry out paragraph (2) of this subsection is the total of the amounts determined under sections 47114(c)(1)(A) and (2) and (d) and 47117(e) of this title. Each amount shall be reduced by an equal percentage to achieve the reduction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall designate not more than 15 current or former military airports for which grants may be made under section 47117(e)(1)(E) of this title. The Secretary may only designate an airport for such grants (other than an airport designated for such grants on or before the date of the enactment of this sentence) if the Secretary finds that grants under such section for projects at such airport would reduce delays at an airport with more than 20,000 hours of annual delays in commercial passenger aircraft takeoffs and landings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Survey</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than September 30, 1991, the Secretary shall complete a survey of current and former military airports to identify which airports have the greatest potential to improve the capacity of the national air transportation system. The survey shall identify the capital development needs of those airports to make them part of the system and which of those qualify for grants under section 47104 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall consider only current or former military airports that, when at least partly converted to civilian commercial or reliever airports as part of the national air transportation system, will enhance airport and air traffic control system capacity in major metropolitan areas and reduce current and projected flight delays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Grants under section 47117(e)(1)(E) of this title may be made for an airport designated under subsection (a) of this section for the 5 fiscal years following the designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Terminal Building Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 47109(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47118_1_target" name="47118_1">1</a></sup> of this title, not more than $5,000,000 for each airport from amounts the Secretary distributes under section 47115 of this title for a fiscal year is available to the sponsor of a current or former military airport the Secretary designates under this section to construct, improve, or repair a terminal building facility, including terminal gates used for revenue passengers getting on or off aircraft. A gate constructed, improved, or repaired under this subsection&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The national aviation noise policy established under section 47523 of this title shall provide for establishing by regulation a national program for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on the operation of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft. The program shall provide for adequate public notice and opportunity for comment on the restrictions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Stage</cap-smallcap> 2 <cap-smallcap>Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, an airport noise or access restriction may include a restriction on the operation of stage 2 aircraft proposed after October 1, 1990, only if the airport operator publishes the proposed restriction and prepares and makes available for public comment at least 180 days before the effective date of the proposed restriction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an analysis of the anticipated or actual costs and benefits of the existing or proposed restriction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of alternative restrictions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a description of the alternative measures considered that do not involve aircraft restrictions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a comparison of the costs and benefits of the alternative measures to the costs and benefits of the proposed restriction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Stage</cap-smallcap> 3 <cap-smallcap>Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of stage 3 aircraft not in effect on October 1, 1990, may become effective only if the restriction has been agreed to by the airport proprietor and all aircraft operators or has been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of Transportation after an airport or aircraft operator's request for approval as provided by the program established under this section. Restrictions to which this paragraph applies include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a restriction on noise levels generated on either a single event or cumulative basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a restriction on the total number of stage 3 aircraft operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a noise budget or noise allocation program that would include stage 3 aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a restriction on hours of operations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) any other restriction on stage 3 aircraft.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 180 days after the Secretary receives an airport or aircraft operator's request for approval of an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of a stage 3 aircraft, the Secretary shall approve or disapprove the restriction. The Secretary may approve the restriction only if the Secretary finds on the basis of substantial evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the restriction is reasonable, nonarbitrary, and nondiscriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the restriction does not create an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the restriction is not inconsistent with maintaining the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the restriction does not conflict with a law or regulation of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) an adequate opportunity has been provided for public comment on the restriction; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:835 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the restriction does not create an unreasonable burden on the national aviation system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection do not apply if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, before November 5, 1990, has formed a working group (outside the process established by part 150 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations) with a local airport operator to examine the noise impact of air traffic control procedure changes at the airport. However, if an agreement on noise reductions at that airport is made between the airport proprietor and one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers that constitute a majority of the carrier use of the airport, this paragraph applies only to a local action to enforce the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may reevaluate an airport noise or access restriction previously agreed to or approved under this subsection on request of an aircraft operator able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there has been a change in the noise environment of the affected airport that justifies a reevaluation. The Secretary shall establish by regulation procedures for conducting a reevaluation. A reevaluation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be based on the criteria in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may be conducted only after 2 years after a decision under paragraph (2) of this subsection has been made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsections (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport noise or access agreement between the airport operator and the aircraft operators in effect on November 5, 1990;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport noise or access restriction agreed to by the airport operator and the aircraft operators before November 5, 1990;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an intergovernmental agreement including an airport noise or access restriction in effect on November 5, 1990;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a subsequent amendment to an airport noise or access agreement or restriction in effect on November 5, 1990, that does not reduce or limit aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) an airport noise or access restriction adopted by an airport operator not later than October 1, 1990, and stayed as of October 1, 1990, by a court order or as a result of litigation, if any part of the restriction is subsequently allowed by a court to take effect; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a new restriction imposed by an airport operator to replace any part of a restriction described in subclause (A) of this clause that is disallowed by a court, if the new restriction would not prohibit aircraft operations in effect on November 5, 1990; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a local action that represents the adoption of the final part of a program of a staged airport noise or access restriction if the initial part of the program was adopted during 1988 and was in effect on November 5, 1990.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Grant Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Beginning on the 91st day after the Secretary prescribes a regulation under subsection (a) of this section, a sponsor of a facility operating under an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of stage 3 aircraft that first became effective after October 1, 1990, is eligible for a grant under section 47104 of this title and is eligible to impose a passenger facility fee under section 40117 of this title only if the restriction has been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) agreed to by the airport proprietor and aircraft operators;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) approved by the Secretary as required by subsection (c)(1) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) rescinded.</p>
