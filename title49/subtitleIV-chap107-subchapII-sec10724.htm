<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title&rdquo; are inserted because 49:317(b) (proviso) and 906(c) (proviso) make this subsection apply to motor and water common carriers. The words &ldquo;without charge&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;free&rdquo; for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;to provide&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;with the object of providing&rdquo; as being more precise. The word &ldquo;emergencies&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;general epidemic, pestilence, or other calamitous visitation&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate redundancy.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;under chapter 105 of this title&rdquo; are inserted because 49:317(b) (proviso), and 906(c) (proviso), and 1005(c) (proviso) make this subsection apply to motor and water common carriers and to freight forwarders. The words &ldquo;The Commission may authorize&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Nothing in this chapter shall prevent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if such .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have first been authorized .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by the Commission&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;by order&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;emergencies&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;in case of earthquake, flood, fire, famine, drought, epidemic, pestilence, or other calamitous visitation or disaster&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate redundancy. The word &ldquo;area&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;section&rdquo; as being more appropriate. The word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;agents&rdquo; for clarity since the reference is to official action. The last sentence is substituted for &ldquo;(with or without a hearing)&rdquo; for consistency. The last sentence of 49:22(1) is omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement.</p>
