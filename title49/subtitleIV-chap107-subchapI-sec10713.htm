<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) One or more rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may enter into a contract with one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified services under specified rates and conditions. Such a rail carrier may not enter into a contract with purchasers of rail service except as provided in this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:250 --><p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Each contract entered into under this section shall be filed with the Commission, together with a summary of the contract containing such nonconfidential information as the Commission prescribes. The Commission shall publish special tariff rules for such contracts in order to assure that the essential terms of the contract are available to the general public in tariff format.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The essential terms of any contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities to be made available to the general public in tariff format under this subsection shall include, but shall not be limited to (i) the identity of the shipper party to the contract; (ii) the specific origins, transit points and other shipper facilities subject to the contract, and destinations served under such contract; (iii) the duration of the contract, including provisions for optional extension; (iv) the actual volume requirements, if any; (v) whether any transportation service has begun under a contract before the date such contract is filed with or approved by the Commission, and (vi) the date on which the contract became applicable to the transportation services provided under the contract. The Commission shall interpret this subsection to provide for liberal discovery to shippers seeking remedies under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any amendment, supplement, or change to any term or provision of any contract described in subparagraph (A), including extensions of such contract, changes of origin, transit points, affected shipper facilities, destination points, or negotiated economic terms, shall be deemed to be a separate and new contract for the purposes of this subsection. Such amendments, supplements, or changes shall be filed separately with the Commission as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Within 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Conrail Privatization Act, the Commission shall issue regulations which require that essential terms of contracts described in subparagraph (A) shall be made available to the general public in tariff format as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The railroad contract rate advisory service established pursuant to subsection (m) of this section shall assess the impact on competition among agricultural shippers of variations between contract rates for various shipments and the published single car rates, and shall submit a report to the Congress not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of the Conrail Privatization Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A contract filed under this section shall be approved by the Commission, as provided in subsection (e) of this section, unless the Commission determines in a proceeding under subsection (d) of this section that such contract is in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) No later than 30 days after the date of filing of a contract under this section, the Commission may, on its own initiative or on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such contract on the grounds described in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a contract other than a contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products and paper), a complaint may be filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by a shipper only on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because the proposed contract unduly impairs the ability of the contracting carrier or carriers to meet their common carrier obligations to the complainant under section 11101 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by a port only on the grounds that such port individually will be harmed because the proposed contract will result in unreasonable discrimination against such port.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products and paper), in addition to the grounds for a complaint described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a complaint may be filed by a shipper on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to the contract at issue, and that shipper was ready, willing, and able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the proposed contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the Commission shall consider the difference between contract rates and published single car rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;unreasonable discrimination&rdquo; has the same meaning as such term has under section 10741 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Within 30 days after the date a proceeding is commenced under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or within such shorter time period after such date as the Commission may establish, the Commission shall determine whether the contract that is the subject of such proceeding is in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines, on the basis of a complaint filed under paragraph (2)(B)(i) of this subsection, that the grounds for a complaint described in such paragraph have been established with respect to a carrier, the Commission shall, subject to the provisions of this section, order such carrier to provide rates and service substantially similar to the contract at issue with such differentials in terms and conditions as are justified by the evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Approval of a contract filed under this section shall be effective&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on the date the Commission expressly approves such contract, but in no event before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date such contract is filed or after the end of the 60-day period beginning on such date; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the Commission has not disapproved such contract by the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date such contract is filed, at the end of such 60-day period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may limit the right of a rail carrier to enter into future contracts under this section following a determination that ad<!-- PDFPage:251 -->ditional contracts would impair the ability of the rail carrier to fulfill its common carrier obligations under section 11101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Commission may not require a rail carrier to violate the terms of a contract that has been approved under this section, except to the extent necessary to comply with section 11128 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A party to a contract entered into under this section shall have no duty in connection with services provided under such contract other than those duties specified by the terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) A contract that is approved by the Commission under this section, and transportation under such contract, shall not be subject to this subtitle, and may not be subsequently challenged before the Commission or in any court on the grounds that such contract violates a provision of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exclusive remedy for any alleged breach of a contract entered into under this section shall be an action in an appropriate State court or United States district court, unless the parties otherwise agree.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The provisions of this section shall not affect the status of any lawful contract between a rail carrier and one or more purchasers of rail service that is in effect on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. Any such contract shall hereafter have the same force and effect as if it had been entered into in accordance with the provisions of this section. Nothing in this section shall affect the rights of the parties to challenge the existence of such a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Any rail carrier may, in accordance with the terms of this section, enter into contracts for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products, but not including wood pulp, wood chips, pulpwood or paper) involving the utilization of carrier owned or leased equipment not in excess of 40 percent of the capacity of such carrier's owned or leased equipment by major car type (plain boxcars, covered hopper cars, gondolas and open top hoppers, coal cars, bulkhead flatcars, pulpwood rackcars, and flatbed equipment, including TOFC/COFC), except that in the case of a proposed contract between a class I carrier and a shipper originating an average of 1,000 cars or more per year during the prior 3-year period by major car type on a particular carrier, not more than 40 percent of carrier owned or leased equipment utilized on the average during the prior 3-year period may be used for such contract without prior authorization by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may, on request of a rail carrier or other party or on its own initiative, grant such relief from the limitations of paragraph (1) of this subsection as the Commission considers appropriate, if it appears that additional equipment may be made available without impairing the rail carrier's ability to meet its common carrier obligations under section 11101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Service under a contract approved under this section shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct class of service, and the equipment used in the fulfillment of such a contract shall not be subject to car service decisions under section 11123 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) The Commission shall establish a railroad contract rate advisory service. The advisory service shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) compile and disseminate to interested parties nonconfidential summaries of the provisions of individual contract information relating to the provisions of contracts entered into under this section with regard to various goods, items, and commodities covered by such contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the Commission and interested parties with advice regarding contracts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assess the impact on competition among shippers of variations between contract rates for various shipments and the published single car rates, and submit a report on such impact to the Congress not later than 90 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.</p>
