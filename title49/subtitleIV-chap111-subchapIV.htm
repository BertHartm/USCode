<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Within two years after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, the Railroad Accounting Principles Board shall establish, for rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, principles governing the determination of economically accurate railroad costs directly and indirectly associated with particular movements of goods, including the variable costs associated with particular movements of goods or such other costs as the Board believes most accurately represent the economic costs of such movements. Such principles shall govern the determination of all railroad costs for specific regulatory proceedings under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In developing cost accounting principles under this section, the Board shall take into account the following considerations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The specific regulatory purposes for which railroad costs are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The degree of accuracy of the cost information which is needed to meet regulatory purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The existing capability and the probable future capability of rail carriers to provide such information and the relative benefits and costs of requiring development of additional capability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The means by which the degree of economic accuracy required can be obtained at the least possible expense and with the least possible information reporting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The means by which the confidentiality of such costs can best be maintained while meeting the need for such information in regulatory proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The cost accounting principles established by the Board shall require that cost information be reported or disclosed only for the essential regulatory purposes defined by the Board.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, each rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall file with the Commission a request for preliminary certification of its cost accounting system. The Commission shall grant such preliminary certification if it determines that the cost accounting system of such rail carrier is in compliance with the accounting standards of the Commission in effect on the day prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) As soon as practicable, but not later than 9 months, after the promulgation of rules by the Commission under section 11163 of this title, each rail carrier described in subsection (a) of this section shall file with the Commission a request for final certification of its cost accounting system developed to comply with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 90 days, or such additional time as the Commission finds necessary, after a rail carrier files its request for final certification under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission shall grant such final certification to such carrier if the Commission determines that the cost accounting system of such carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title. If the Commission denies such final certification, the rail carrier shall revise its cost accounting system and file a new request for certification within 90 days after the date of such denial. The Commission shall thereupon grant final certification if it determines that such cost accounting system, as revised, is in compliance with such rules. If <!-- PDFPage:334 -->the Commission again denies final certification to the rail carrier, the Commission shall prescribe a cost accounting system which such carrier shall adopt within a reasonable time and which shall be considered a finally certified cost accounting system for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each rail carrier shall have and maintain a cost accounting system that is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Certification under this section that the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title shall be valid until the promulgation of new rules by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is certified under this section, such rail carrier may, after notifying the Commission, make modifications in such system unless, within 60 days after the date of notification, the Commission finds such modifications to be inconsistent with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of determining whether the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission, the Commission shall have the right to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records of such rail carrier relating to compliance with such rules. Such documents, papers, and records (and any copies thereof) shall not be subject to the mandatory disclosure requirements of section 552 of title 5.</p>

Such requirements shall be cost effective and compatible with and not duplicative of the managerial and responsibility accounting requirements of those carriers.
