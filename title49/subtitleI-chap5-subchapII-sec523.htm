<p class="note-body">The section is included because 49:1655(f)(2) gave the same administrative powers exercised by the Interstate Commerce Commission under certain sections of title 49 to the Secretary of Transportation to carry out duties transferred to the Secretary by 49:1655(e). See the revision notes for section 501 of the revised title for an explanation of the transfer under 49:1655(f)(2). The powers of the Commission have been codified in subtitle IV of the revised title. The comparable provisions of title 49 that are represented by the section may be found as follows:</p>

<p class="note-body">See the revision notes for the revised section for an explanation of changes made in the text. Changes not accounted for in those revision notes are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) does not apply to motor carriers of migrant workers and motor private carriers because 49:322(e) only applies to motor carriers and 49:304(a)(3) and (3a) do not apply 49:322(e) to motor carriers of migrant workers and motor private carriers. The words &ldquo;engaged in interstate or foreign commerce&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (b) and (c), the text of 49:304(a)(3) (last sentence 1st&ndash;7th words) and (3a) (last sentence 1st&ndash;5th words) is omitted as executed.</p>
