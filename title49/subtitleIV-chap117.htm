<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin an investigation under this subtitle on its own initiative or on complaint. If the Commission finds that a carrier, broker or freight forwarder is violating this subtitle, the Commission shall take appropriate action to compel compliance with this subtitle. If the Commission finds that a foreign motor carrier or foreign motor private carrier is violating section 10530 of this title, the Commission shall take appropriate action to compel compliance with such section. The Commission may take that action only after giving the carrier, broker or freight forwarder notice of the investigation and an opportunity for a proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person, including a governmental authority, may file with the Commission a complaint about a violation of this subtitle by a carrier providing, or broker for, transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subtitle or a foreign motor carrier or foreign motor private carrier providing transportation under a certificate of registration issued under section 10530 of this title, or freight forwarder. The complaint must state the facts that are the subject of the violation and, if it is against a water carrier, must be made under oath. The Commission may dismiss a complaint it determines does not state reasonable grounds for investigation and action. However, the Commission may not dismiss a complaint made against a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title because of the absence of direct damage to the complainant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A formal investigative proceeding begun by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section is dismissed automatically unless it is concluded by the Commission with administrative finality by the end of the 3d year after the date on which it was begun.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is patterned after 49:1003(f) (1st sentence) and 1006(a) (last sentence) for clarity. The words &ldquo;an investigation under this subtitle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;investigate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whether any freight forwarder has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter or <!-- PDFPage:370 -->with any order, rule, regulation, or requirement issued or established pursuant thereto&rdquo; as being more inclusive and appropriate in view of the power to &ldquo;compel compliance&rdquo; in 49:1003(f) and restated in this subsection. The words &ldquo;after giving the carrier .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. notice of the investigation and an opportunity for a proceeding&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;after notice and hearing&rdquo; in 49:1003(f) and &ldquo;If such freight forwarder shall not satisfy the complaint within a time specified by the Commission&rdquo; in 49:1006(a) for clarity and to conform to other sections of the revised title. The words &ldquo;it shall be the duty of the Commission to investigate the matters complained of in such manner and by such means as it shall deem proper&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of section 10321(a) of the revised title requiring the Commission to carry out the revised subtitle. The words &ldquo;or there shall be any reasonable ground for investigating said complaint&rdquo; are omitted as surplus in view of subsection (b). The text of 49:5(8) (less last sentence), (10) and 1011(d), (f) are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement of the general investigatory and enforcement power of the Commission. The 2d sentence of 49:13(1) is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;person, firm, corporation, company, or association, or any mercantile, agricultural, or manufacturing society or other organization .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or any common carrier&rdquo; in view of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;governmental authority&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;State board&rdquo; and &ldquo;or any body politic or municipal organization&rdquo; for consistency and as being more inclusive. The words &ldquo;file .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a complaint&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may make complaint in writing&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;about a violation of this subtitle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;of anything done or omitted to be done .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in contravention of the provisions thereof&rdquo; in 49:13(1) for clarity. The words &ldquo;in violation of this section or of section 317 of this title&rdquo; in 49:316(e) are omitted as surplus in view of the restatement of 49:304(c). The words &ldquo;must state the facts&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall briefly state the facts&rdquo; in 49:13(1) and for &ldquo;state fully the facts&rdquo; in 49:1006(a) for consistency and in view of the power of the Commission to prescribe regulations to carry out the revised subtitle in section 10321(a) of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;which is instituted by the Commission after February 5, 1976&rdquo; are omitted as executed.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A person injured because a carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder does not obey an order of the Commission, except an order for the payment of money, may bring a civil action to enforce that order under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of <!-- PDFPage:373 -->the Commission under chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder is liable to a person for amounts charged that exceed the applicable rate for transportation or service contained in a tariff filed under subchapter IV of chapter 107 of this title or the applicable freight forwarder rate, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title is liable for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of that carrier in violation of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or IV of chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder is liable for damages resulting from the imposition of rates for transportation or service the Commission finds to be in violation of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A person may file a complaint with the Commission under section 11701(b) of this title or bring a civil action under subsection (b) (1) or (2) of this section to enforce liability against a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title. A person may begin a proceeding under section 10704 or 10705 of this title to enforce liability under subsection (b)(3) of this section by filing a complaint with the Commission under section 11701(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Commission makes an award under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall order the carrier to pay the amount awarded by a specific date. The Commission may order a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title to pay damages only when the proceeding is on complaint. The person for whose benefit an order of the Commission requiring the payment of money is made may bring a civil action to enforce that order under this paragraph if the carrier does not pay the amount awarded by the date payment was ordered to be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) When a person begins a civil action under subsection (b) of this section to enforce an order of the Commission requiring the payment of damages by a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title, the text of the order of the Commission must be included in the complaint. In addition to the district courts of the United States, a State court of general jurisdiction having jurisdiction of the parties has jurisdiction to enforce an order under this paragraph. The findings and order of the Commission are competent evidence of the facts stated in them. Trial in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States under this paragraph is in the judicial district (A) in which the plaintiff resides, (B) in which the principal operating office of the carrier is located, (C) if a rail carrier, through which the railroad line of that carrier runs, or (D) if a water carrier, in which a port of call on a route operated by that carrier is located. In a civil action under this paragraph, the plaintiff is liable for only those costs that accrue on an appeal taken by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All parties in whose favor the award was made may be joined as plaintiffs in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States under this subsection and all the carriers that are parties to the order awarding damages may be joined as defendants. Trial in the action is in the judicial district in which any one of the plaintiffs could bring the action against any one of the defendants. Process may be served on a defendant at its principal operating office when that defendant is not in the district in which the action is brought. A judgment ordering recovery may be made in favor of any of those plaintiffs against the defendant found to be liable to that plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The district court shall award a reasonable attorney's fee as a part of the damages for which a carrier is found liable under this subsection. The district court shall tax and collect that fee as a part of the costs of the action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) must begin such a civil action within 2 years after the claim accrues if the transportation or service is provided by the carrier in the 1-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) must begin such a civil action within 18 months after the claim accrues if the transportation or service is provided by the carrier after the last day of such 1-year period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person must begin a civil action to recover overcharges under section 11705(b)(1) of this title within 3 years after the claim accrues; except that a person must begin a civil action to recover overcharges from a motor carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title for transportation or service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) within 2 years after the claim accrues if such transportation or service is provided in the 1-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of the Negotiated Rate Act of 1993; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11707. Liability of common carriers under receipts and bills of lading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I, II, or IV of chapter 105 of this title and a freight forwarder shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this subtitle. That carrier or freight forwarder and any other common carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or IV are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this paragraph is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by (1) the receiving carrier, (2) the delivering carrier, or (3) another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or <!-- PDFPage:377 -->from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading and, except in the case of a freight forwarder, applies to property reconsigned or diverted under a tariff filed under subchapter IV of chapter 107 of this title. Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a carrier or freight forwarder. A delivering carrier is deemed to be the carrier performing the line-haul transportation nearest the destination but does not include a carrier providing only a switching service at the destination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A freight forwarder is both the receiving and delivering carrier. When a freight forwarder provides service and uses a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title to receive property from a consignor, the motor common carrier may execute the bill of lading or shipping receipt for the freight forwarder with its consent. With the consent of the freight forwarder, a motor common carrier may deliver property for a freight forwarder on the freight forwarder's bill of lading, freight bill, or shipping receipt to the consignee named in it, and receipt for the property may be made on the freight forwarder's delivery receipt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The carrier issuing the receipt or bill of lading under subsection (a) of this section or delivering the property for which the receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to recover from the carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury occurred the amount required to be paid to the owners of the property, as evidenced by a receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the amount of its expenses reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A common carrier and freight forwarder may not limit or be exempt from liability imposed under subsection (a) of this section except as provided in this subsection. A limitation of liability or of the amount of recovery or representation or agreement in a receipt, bill of lading, contract, rule, or tariff filed with the Commission in violation of this section is void.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If loss or injury to property occurs while it is in the custody of a water carrier, the liability of that carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law applicable to water transportation. The liability of the initial or delivering carrier is the same as the liability of the water carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A common carrier of passengers may limit its liability under its passenger rate for loss or injury of baggage carried on passenger trains, boats, or motor vehicles, or on trains, or boats, or motor vehicles carrying passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A common carrier may limit its liability for loss or injury of property transported under section 10730 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be brought against a delivering carrier (other than a rail carrier) in a district court of the United States or in a State court. Trial, if the action is brought in a district court of the United States is in a judicial district, and if in a State court, is in a State, through which the defendant carrier operates a railroad or route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be brought&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the principal place of business of the person bringing the action is located if the delivering carrier operates a railroad or a route through such judicial district, or in the judicial district in which the point of destination is located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A civil action under this section may be brought in a United States district court or in a State court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In this section, &ldquo;judicial district&rdquo; means (i) in the case of a United States district court, a judicial district of the United States, and (ii) in the case of a State court, the applicable geographic area over which such court exercises jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A carrier or freight forwarder may not provide by rule, contract, or otherwise, a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim against it under this section and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section. The period for bringing a civil action is computed from the date the carrier or freight forwarder gives a person written notice that the carrier or freight forwarder has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice. For the purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an offer of compromise shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the carrier or freight forwarder, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed and provides reasons for such disallowance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) communications received from a carrier's or freight forwarder's insurer shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the insurer, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed, provides reasons for such disallowance, and informs the claimant that the insurer is acting on behalf of the carrier or freight forwarder.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) One or more motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title who want to establish a program to settle disputes between such carriers and shippers of household goods concerning the transportation of household goods may submit an application for establishing such program to the Commission. Such application shall be in such form and contain such information as the Commission may, by regulation, require. The Commission shall review and approve, in accordance with the provisions of this section, each application submitted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall approve, at least within 45 days of its filing, any application to establish a program for settling disputes concerning the transportation of household goods which meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may investigate at any time the functioning of any program approved under this section and, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, may suspend or revoke its approval for failure to meet the requirements of this section and such regulations as the Commission may issue to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No program for settling disputes concerning the transportation of household goods may be approved under this section unless the program is a fair and expeditious method for settling such disputes and complies with each of the following requirements and such regulations as the Commission may issue:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The program is designed to prevent a carrier from having any special advantage in any case in which the claimant resides or does business at a place distant from the carrier's principal or other place of business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The program provides for adequate notice of the availability of such program, including a concise easy-to-read, accurate summary of the program and disclosure of the legal effects of election to utilize the program. Such notice must be given to persons for whom household goods are to be transported by the carrier before such goods are tendered to the carrier for transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Upon request of a shipper, the carrier must promptly provide such forms and other information as are necessary for initiating an action under the program to resolve a dispute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Each person, authorized pursuant to the program to arbitrate or otherwise settle disputes, must be independent of the parties to the dispute and must be capable, as determined under such regulations as the Commission may issue, to resolve such disputes fairly and expeditiously. The program must ensure that each person chosen to settle the disputes is authorized and able to obtain from the shipper or carrier any material and relevant information to the extent necessary to carry out a fair and expeditious decisionmaking process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) No fee for instituting a proceeding under the program may be charged the shipper; except that, if the program is binding solely on the carrier, the shipper may be charged a fee of not more than $25 for instituting a proceeding under the program. In any case in which a shipper is charged a fee under this paragraph for instituting a proceeding under the program and such dispute is settled in favor of the ship<!-- PDFPage:381 -->per, the person settling the dispute must refund such fee to the shipper unless the person settling the dispute determines that such refund is inappropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The program must not require the shipper to agree to utilize the dispute settlement program prior to the time that a dispute arises.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The program may provide for an oral presentation of a dispute concerning transportation of household goods by a party to the dispute (or a party's representative), but such oral presentation may be made only if all parties to the dispute expressly agree to such presentation and the date, time, and location of such presentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Any person settling a dispute concerning transportation of household goods under the program must, as expeditiously as possible but at least within 60 days of receipt of written notification of the dispute, render a decision based on the information gathered, except that, in any case in which a party to the dispute fails to provide in a timely manner any information concerning such dispute which the person settling the dispute may reasonably require to resolve the dispute, the dispute settler may extend such 60-day period for a reasonable period of time. A decision resolving a dispute may include any remedies appropriate under the circumstances, including repair, replacement, refund, reimbursement for expenses, and compensation for damages.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Materials and information obtained in the course of a decisionmaking process to settle a dispute under a dispute settlement program approved under this section may not be used to bring an action under section 11910 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title concerning the transportation of household goods by such carrier, the shipper shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the shipper submits a claim to the carrier within 120 days after the date the shipment is delivered or the date the delivery is scheduled, whichever is later;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the shipper prevails in such court action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) no dispute settlement program approved under this section was available for use by the shipper to resolve the dispute; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a decision resolving the dispute was not rendered under a dispute settlement program approved under this section within the period provided under subsection (b)(8) of this section or an extension of such period under such subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the court proceeding is to enforce a decision rendered under a dispute settlement program approved under this section and is instituted after the period for performance under such decision has elapsed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title concerning the transportation of household goods by such carrier, such carrier may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees by the court only if the shipper brought such action in bad faith&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after resolution of such dispute under a dispute settlement program approved under this section; or</p>
