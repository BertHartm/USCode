<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may publish and apply a surcharge increasing or decreasing the through charge applicable to any movement between points designated by the surcharging carrier subject to a joint rate. Such a surcharge may be applied without the concurrence of the other carriers that are party in such joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A carrier earning adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, may not apply such a surcharge to any movement on a line operated by such carrier which carried more than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any surcharge applied pursuant to this subsection must be applied in equal dollar amounts to the movement subject to the surcharge over all routes between the points designated by the surcharging carrier which such carrier participates in under the joint rate involved, and when the surcharge increases the through charges, under any of such carrier's single line rates between the same points.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Whenever a rail carrier applies a surcharge increasing a through charge pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, any other rail carrier that participates in any movement subject to such surcharge may cancel the application of such surcharge to any route participated in by such other carrier, if such carrier makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A rail carrier may cancel the application of a surcharge under this paragraph if such carrier demonstrates to the Commission that the surcharging carrier's share of the revenues, at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, from its participation in the movement over the route involved would have been equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route, under either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, without the surcharge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a new rate division increasing the share of the surcharging carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a new higher lawful rate published by the canceling carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a new, lesser surcharge which shall be prescribed by the Commission upon and in conformity with the request of the carrier proposing to cancel the surcharge. Any such prescribed surcharge shall, in conjunction with the surcharging carrier's division of the joint rate in effect on the date the original surcharge was filed with the Commission, provide the carrier proposing the original surcharge revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of such surcharging carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The canceling tariff shall only become effective if the rail carrier proposing to cancel the application of the surcharge makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the demonstration described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is made on the basis of the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, without the surcharge, the tariff shall become effective on one day's notice after such determination is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the demonstration described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is made on the basis of a new rate, division, or surcharge prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph, the tariff shall become effective on the date such new rate, division, or surcharge becomes effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The remedy available to a rail carrier canceling the application of a surcharge under this paragraph shall be in addition to any other remedy available to such carrier under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge to a route to which such surcharge applies if a shipper moving traffic over such route demonstrates to the Commission that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there is no competitive alternative to such route for the movement of the traffic involved that is not subject to such surcharge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the surcharging carrier's share of the revenues from its participation in the move<!-- PDFPage:230 -->ment over the route to which such surcharge applies, under the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, with the surcharge, would be greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission cancels the application of a surcharge to a particular route pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission shall determine the level of surcharge which, in conjunction with the surcharging carrier's division of the joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, would equal 110 percent of the surcharging carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route, and shall authorize such carrier immediately to apply such a surcharge without any further proceedings under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection unless, for the one-year period preceding the surcharge, such carrier has concurred in all rate increases of general applicability applicable to the joint rate to which such surcharge applies and agreed to by all other carriers that are party to such joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection increasing a through charge applicable to a particular movement more than once each calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a rail carrier may, by tariff, reduce the total charges applicable to a movement over any specific joint line or single line route or routes in which such carrier participates, if such reduction does not lower the total charges applicable to such movement to a level that is less than the lowest total charges applicable to the same movement over a competing route. Any such reduction may be made without the concurrence of any other rail carrier, and shall be borne solely by the carrier reducing the charge. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the right of a carrier to reduce rates over routes not in direct competition between the same points with routes to which it has applied a surcharge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a rail carrier not earning adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, may publish and apply a surcharge applicable to traffic originating or terminating upon any of its lines that carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the most recent calendar year for which traffic data is available; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a rail carrier earning adequate revenues, as so determined, may publish and apply a surcharge applicable to traffic originating or terminating upon any of its lines that carried less than 1,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in such most recent calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such a surcharge may be applied without the concurrence of any rail carrier. Any such surcharge may be allocated, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection, in different amounts among different movements between different origins and destinations, and shall accrue solely to the surcharging carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier may apply a surcharge under this subsection if, prior to the application of such surcharge, that portion of the charges applicable to traffic to and from the line to which the surcharge applies and accruing to the surcharging carrier does not provide such carrier revenues adequate to cover&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting the traffic involved to or from such line; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 100 percent of such carrier's reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line, which shall include all costs necessary to sustain service on the line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall, within 120 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, complete a proceeding to define the term &ldquo;reasonably expected costs&rdquo; as used in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. In the interim, the term shall be construed in accordance with Rail Services Planning Office subsidy standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Upon petition of a shipper located upon a line to which a surcharge under this subsection is applied, the Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge under this subsection if such shipper demonstrates to the Commission that, after application of the surcharge, the surcharging carrier's revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon the line to which the surcharge applies exceed 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus such carrier's reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A rail carrier's revenue from all traffic originating or terminating upon a line shall be presumed to exceed 110 percent of its variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus its reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line if the complaining shipper demonstrates that the carrier is earning revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon such line that result in a revenue-variable cost percentage that is equal to or greater than the revenue-variable cost percentage applicable in that year under section 10709(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A surcharging carrier may rebut the presumption set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph by demonstrating to the Commission that its reasonably expected costs for operating the line to which the surcharge applies exceed the percentage of variable cost set forth in such clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a finding by the Commission that application of the surcharge will produce revenues in excess of 110 percent of the surcharging carrier's variable cost of transporting traffic to or from the line plus its reasonably expected costs for operating the line, the Commission shall determine the level of surcharge which would produce revenues equal to such figure and shall authorize such carrier immediately to apply such surcharges as will generate such revenues without any further proceedings, subject only to the right of a shipper to proceed under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection that results in any shipper being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate the line to which such surcharge applies.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:231 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon complaint of a shipper, the Commission shall determine whether the shipper is being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the costs described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Commission finds that a complaining shipper is being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the costs described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission may reallocate the surcharge among the traffic originating or terminating on the line to which the surcharge applies, but may not order relief which would result in the surcharging carrier earning revenues less than those which the carrier would have earned had the surcharge been applied as filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A shipper may, in a single complaint, seek relief under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. In any such complaint, the Commission shall first determine the right to relief under paragraph (3) and shall grant such relief as is appropriate under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any proceeding brought before the Commission challenging the application or amount of a surcharge under this subsection, whether the surcharge is claimed to violate this subsection or some other provision of this chapter, the Commission shall not suspend the application of any such surcharge unless the person filing the verified statement required by section 10707(c) of this title, in addition to the matters required by such section, also makes the demonstration required by paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection. If the demonstration required by such paragraph (3)(A) is made, the Commission may suspend the application of only so much of the surcharge as will produce revenues in excess of the amount so demonstrated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any prior agreement in effect on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, or any requirement of the Commission, a rail carrier may cancel the application of a joint rate to a through route in which it participates, without the concurrence of any other rail carrier that is a party to such joint rate, unless another rail carrier that participates in such through route or a shipper that has no competitive alternative to such route makes the demonstration described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The application of a joint rate to a through route may not be canceled under this subsection if a rail carrier that participates in such through route or a shipper that has no competitive alternative to such route from an origin or destination served by such route demonstrates to the Commission that the canceling carrier's share of the revenues, under the joint rate in effect at the time the application of the joint rate is canceled, is equal to or greater than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 110 percent of the canceling carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such lesser percent of the canceling carrier's variable cost as such carrier earns over a competing through route to which application of the joint rate has not been canceled, or over a competing single line route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a complaining party is unable to make the demonstration required by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission may suspend the tariff canceling the joint rate only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a complaining carrier publishes a new rate division or a new higher lawful rate which increases the canceling carrier's share of the revenues over such route to the amount calculated under paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B) of this subsection, whichever is less; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a complaining carrier or shipper petitions the Commission and the Commission imposes a surcharge, in conformity with such petition, upon the joint rate which will accrue solely to the canceling carrier and which, in conjunction with the canceling carrier's division of the joint rate in effect on the date the tariff canceling the joint rate was filed, will provide the canceling carrier revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Unless a new rate, division, or surcharge described in this paragraph becomes effective within 120 days after the proposed effective date of the rate cancellation, the canceling tariff shall, nevertheless, become effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the demonstration described in paragraph (2) is made or a new rate, division, or surcharge described in paragraph (3) becomes effective, the tariff canceling the joint rate shall be considered by the Commission in accordance with section 10705 of this title. The existing joint rate or the new rate division, or surcharge, shall remain in effect during the pendency of the Commission's consideration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Whenever the application of a joint rate to a through route is canceled under this subsection and a rate other than a joint rate is or has been published by the canceling carrier to apply to such route, such rate shall thereafter apply in lieu of all other rates (except joint rates subsequently agreed to by such carrier) and any through rate of which such rate is a factor shall divide as the separate factors of such rate are made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission under section 10705(a) of this title to prescribe joint rates which provide a rail carrier participating in such joint rate revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over each route to which such rate applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any increase or decrease in revenue resulting from the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section, or from the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section, shall accrue solely to or be borne solely by the carrier applying the surcharge or canceling the application of the joint rate, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a class III rail carrier which participates in a through route to which a surcharge has been applied under subsection (a) of this section by a carrier operating in the same rate territory as such class III carrier demonstrates to the Commission that the application of such surcharge to such route provides, in the absence of any increase in the joint rate in effect on the date the surcharge was filed with the Commission, revenues from traffic moving over such route to such surcharging carrier in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs over such route, such surcharging carrier shall, from <!-- PDFPage:232 -->the date of such demonstration, share those revenues from such route, from the surcharge and the applicable joint rate in effect on the date the surcharge was filed with the Commission, in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs with all class III rail carriers in the same rate territory participating in such route, on the basis of their existing divisions of the joint rate to which the surcharge applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, whenever a rail carrier proposes to apply a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or to cancel the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section and another rail carrier subsequently agrees to a new rate division or a new lawful rate that increases the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over a particular through route subject to a joint rate, such other rail carrier shall also agree to any other new rate division and new lawful rate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that is proposed within 120 days after the date of the first agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that increases the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for movements over a competing through route subject to such joint rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier shall not be required to agree under this subsection to any proposed new division or new rate which would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route to less than (i) 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route, or (ii) such lesser percent of its variable costs as such carrier earns from such movement over a competing through route with respect to which such carrier has agreed to a new division or rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route to an amount in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route by a dollar amount in excess of the greatest dollar reduction which such carrier has agreed to make, for purposes of increasing the surcharging or canceling carrier's share, to its share of the total through charges for a movement over any competing through route; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route in an amount in excess of such carrier's pro rata share (based on established divisions for movements over such route) of the increase of the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for movements over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A rail carrier applying a surcharge or canceling the application of a joint rate under this section shall file a tariff with the Commission in accordance with section 10762 of this title. Such a tariff may not become effective until the expiration of the 45-day period (or such longer period as the filing carrier specifies) beginning on the date such tariff is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Any rail rate to which a surcharge is applied under this section shall be subject to section 10701a and 10709 of this title, and any such surcharge shall constitute a rate increase for purposes of such sections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of rate regulation under section 10701a of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) only the rail carrier proposing a surcharge under this section shall be required to defend such surcharge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the reasonableness of the surcharge and the revenues received by the rail carrier proposing the surcharge under the joint rate to which the surcharge applies shall be determined without regard to amount received and services performed by other rail carriers that are party to such joint rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in subsection (i), (j), or (k) of this section, if the application of a surcharge or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under this section is found to constitute a violation of any provision of this subtitle, such violation shall not be ordered remedied in any manner which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requires the carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or canceling the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section to provide service over any route under a rate that provides revenues to such carrier that are less than 110 percent of its variable costs of providing such service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which requires the carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (b) of this section to provide service over the route to which such surcharge applies in a manner that provides revenues to such carrier that are less than 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting the traffic involved to or from the line to which the surcharge applies, plus such carrier's reasonably expected costs of providing service over such line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Within 5 days after the request of a rail carrier participating in a joint rate subject to a surcharge or cancellation under this section, a shipper moving traffic over a route to which such surcharge or cancellation applies, or an affected port, the Commission shall make available to such carrier, shipper, or port the Commission's determination of the variable costs and revenues, over the route or routes to which the surcharge or cancellation applies, of the carrier applying the surcharge or canceling the application of the joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) Whenever a class III rail carrier, in a protest filed with the Commission, makes a prima facie showing that the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section will have an adverse effect on competition, the Commission shall investigate such protest. If, on the basis of such investigation, the Commission finds that the protested surcharge or cancellation is or is intended to be anticompetitive, the Commission shall, within 30 days after the date such protest is filed, enter an order rescinding such surcharge or cancellation, and may, on presentation of an adequate record, prescribe new joint rates or divisions of joint rates.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:233 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) No order prescribed under this subsection shall require a carrier to provide service over any route under a rate which provides revenues less than 110 percent of the variable cost of providing such service unless the Commission determines that the public interest requires a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio to avoid anticompetitive action and to preserve service on the route involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) Any class III rail carrier which originates or terminates traffic subject to the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section may protest such surcharge or cancellation whenever&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such surcharge or cancellation affects the sole remaining route available to that carrier for that traffic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) such carrier demonstrates that alternative transportation is available or that a shipper dependent on that carrier will suffer significant market loss because of such surcharge or cancellation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such surcharge or cancellation, alone or when considered in conjunction with other surcharges or cancellations affecting the carrier, is likely to unduly impair a carrier's ability to earn an adequate rate of return.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission may, after an investigation on the basis of a protest under this subsection, prescribe a lesser surcharge or a different division of the joint rate. The Commission shall grant the surcharging or canceling carrier revenues not less than 110 percent of its variable cost of the movement involved, unless it determines that the public interest requires a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio to preserve service on the route involved. Any action by the Commission based on a protest under this subsection shall be taken within 30 days after the date such protest is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission prescribes a different division of a joint rate under this paragraph, the Commission shall, upon petition of the surcharging or canceling carrier or the protesting class III rail carrier, reopen the proceeding in which such division was prescribed to reconsider whether such prescribed division is reasonable. If, on the basis of such reconsideration, the Commission determines that such division is not reasonable, it shall prescribe a new, reasonable division of the joint rate to which the surcharge or cancellation applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Upon the complaint of a class III rail carrier which originates or terminates traffic subject to the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section that such surcharge or cancellation will result in differences or greater differences in rates, including any surcharges, for the traffic to which the surcharge or cancellation applies over different routes in which the surcharging or canceling carrier participates&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) from a single origin point to destination points within a 75 mile direct radius from the destination point on such class III rail carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to a single destination point from origin points within a 75 mile direct radius from the origin point on such class III rail carrier,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall investigate such complaint and shall, within 30 days after the date such complaint is filed, take such actions, including rescinding surcharges or cancellations or prescribing new joint rates or surcharges, as it determines are required to eliminate such differences in rates, unless it finds that such actions are not warranted by the public interest in ensuring effective competition among rail carriers or in the preservation of rail service on the route involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No action taken by the Commission under this subsection shall require a carrier to provide service over any route under a rate which provides a revenue to variable cost ratio over such route less than that provided under the joint rate to which the surcharge or cancellation was applied or less than 110 percent, whichever is greater, unless the Commission determines that the public interest in ensuring effective competition among rail carriers or in preserving service over such route warrants requiring the surcharging or canceling carrier to provide service at a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding subsection (m)(1) of this section, if, in a proceeding under this subsection or under subsection (i) or (j) of this section, the Commission considers whether to require the revenues of a carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or canceling the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section to be less than 110 percent of its variable costs (as calculated using the Commission's Rail Form A cost finding methodology), such surcharging or canceling carrier may prove its actual variable costs on the basis of evidence other than unadjusted costs calculated using such Rail Form A cost finding methodology. Such evidence shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Whenever the application of a joint rate to a through route is canceled under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall, upon petition by a class II or III rail carrier participating in such route, prescribe a new compensatory through rate or rates over such route within 30 days after the date such petition is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) variable costs for a class I rail carrier shall be determined only by using such carrier's unadjusted costs, calculated using the Commission's Rail Form A cost finding methodology (or an alternative methodology adopted by the Commission in lieu thereof) and indexed quarterly to account for current wage and price levels in the region in which the carrier operates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) variable costs for a rail carrier other than class I shall be presumed to be the average variable costs of all class I rail carriers in the region in which such carrier operates (as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection) unless a rail carrier rebuts such presumption with other proof of variable costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at the option of a carrier applying a surcharge or canceling the application of a joint rate under this section, revenue share may be <!-- PDFPage:234 -->determined by reference to past revenue settlements actually made in the most recent calendar year by connecting lines.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(n) Surcharges applied under subsection (a) or (c) of this section and cancellations under subsection (c) of this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 10726(a)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) The Special Counsel of the Commission may, consistent with the rail transportation policy in section 10101a of this title, provide assistance to class III rail carriers and small businesses in preparing actions under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(p)(1) The authority to apply a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section, and (except as provided in paragraph (2)) the authority to cancel such a surcharge, shall expire 3 years after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 unless extended for one additional year by the Commission upon petition of any rail carrier and for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any surcharge lawfully applied under subsection (a) of this section shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms following the expiration of the provisions of this section. Any such surcharge applied during the 45-day period immediately preceding the date of the expiration of the provisions of this section shall, notwithstanding such expiration, be subject to cancellation under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section during the 45-day period beginning on the date such surcharge is applied.</p>
