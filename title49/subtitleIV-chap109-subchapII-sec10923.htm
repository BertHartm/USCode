<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in this section and section 10930 of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall issue a permit to a person authorizing the person to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or III of chapter 105 of this title as a motor contract carrier of household goods or passengers or water contract carrier, respectively, or to provide service subject to that jurisdiction under subchapter IV of chapter 105 as a households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_1_target" name="10923_1">1</a></sup> goods freight forwarder, if the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the person is fit, willing, and able&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide the transportation or service to be authorized by the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to comply with this subtitle and regulations of the Commission; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the transportation or service to be provided under the permit is or will be consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in this section and section 10930 of this title, the Commission shall issue a permit to a person authorizing the person to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title as a motor contract carrier of property other than household goods if the Commission finds that the person is able to comply with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) this subtitle, the regulations of the Commission, and any safety requirements imposed by the Commission,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the safety fitness requirements established by the Secretary of Transportation in consultation with the Commission pursuant to section 31144 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the minimum financial responsibility requirements established by the Commission pursuant to section 10927 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In deciding whether to approve the application of a person for a permit as a motor contract carrier of property other than household goods the Commission shall consider any evidence demonstrating that the applicant is unable to comply with this subtitle, the regulations of the Commission, safety requirements of the Commission, or the safety fitness and minimum financial responsibility requirements of subsection (b)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall find any applicant for authority to operate as a motor carrier of property other than household goods under this subsection to be unfit if the applicant does not meet the safety and safety fitness requirements of paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of this subsection and shall deny the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A person may protest an application under this subsection to provide transportation only on the ground that the applicant fails or will fail to comply with this subtitle, the regulations of the Commission, safety requirements of the Commission, or the safety fitness or minimum financial responsibility requirements of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A person must file an application with the Commission for a permit to provide transportation as a contract carrier or to provide service as a households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_2_target" name="10923_2">2</a></sup> goods freight forwarder.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be served on persons designated by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to applications under this section for authority to provide transportation as a motor contract carrier of passengers. The requirement that persons issued permits under this section as motor contract carriers of passengers be fit, willing, and able means safety fitness and proof of minimum financial responsibility under section 18&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_3_target" name="10923_3">3</a></sup> of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In deciding whether to approve the application of a person for a permit as a motor contract carrier of household goods, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the nature of the transportation proposed to be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect that granting the permit would have on the protesting carriers if such grant would endanger or impair their operations to an extent contrary to the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the effect that denying the permit would have on the person applying for the permit, its shippers, or both; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the changing character of the requirements of those shippers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No motor carrier of property may protest an application to provide transportation as a motor contract carrier of household goods filed under this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) it possesses authority to handle, in whole or in part, the traffic for which authority is applied;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) it is willing and able to provide service that meets the reasonable needs of the shippers involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) it has performed service within the scope of the application during the previous 12-month period or has, actively in good faith, solicited service within the scope of the application during such period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it has pending before the Commission an application filed prior in time to the applica<!-- PDFPage:304 -->tion being considered for substantially the same traffic; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Commission grants leave to intervene upon a showing of other interests that are not contrary to the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to applications of persons for permits as motor contract carriers of household goods, the Commission may not make a finding relating to the public interest under subsection (a)(2) of this section which is based upon general findings developed in rulemaking proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Commission may not deny any part of an application for a households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder permit filed by a corporation controlled by, or under common control with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title, because of the relationship between the corporation and that carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 only because the service to be provided by the corporation will compete with service provided by another households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder subject to subchapter IV of that chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each permit issued to a person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide transportation as a motor contract carrier is subject to section 10927(a) of this title and shall specify the transportation to be provided by the carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide transportation as a water contract carrier shall specify the transportation to be provided by the carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide service as a households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder shall specify the nature or general description about which the service is to be provided, the area in which, and the areas between which, the service may be provided by the households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Commission may prescribe necessary conditions under which a contract carrier of passengers or household goods or households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder provides transportation or service, except that in the case of a motor contract carrier of property, the Commission may not require such carrier to limit its operations to carriage for a particular industry or within a particular geographic area. The Commission may prescribe the conditions when the permit is issued and at any time thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The permit for a motor contract carrier shall specify necessary conditions, including in the case of a motor contract carrier of passengers, the number of persons, for which the carrier may provide transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to ensure that the carrier provides transportation as a motor contract carrier and within the scope of the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to carry out requirements established by the Commission under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to the permit and its conditions, a motor contract carrier may substitute or add to its equipment and facilities as requests for its transportation develop. The Commission may not prescribe a condition preventing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a water contract carrier from substituting or adding contracts within the scope of the permit to satisfy the requirements of business development and public demand; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a water contract carrier or households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder from adding to its equipment and facilities, and transportation or service, as the case may be, within the scope of the permit to satisfy the requirements of business development and public demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A motor contract carrier of property may deliver to or receive from a rail carrier a trailer moving in trailer-on-flat-car service at any point on the route of the rail carrier if the motor carrier is authorized to serve the origin and destination points of the traffic.</p>
