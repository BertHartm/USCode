<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Safety Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to section 30103(a) of this title, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety. The regulations shall prescribe minimum safety standards for commercial motor vehicles. At a minimum, the regulations shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) commercial motor vehicles are maintained, equipped, loaded, and operated safely;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the responsibilities imposed on operators of commercial motor vehicles do not impair their ability to operate the vehicles safely;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the physical condition of operators of commercial motor vehicles is adequate to enable them to operate the vehicles safely; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the operation of commercial motor vehicles does not have a deleterious effect on the physical condition of the operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Eliminating and Amending Existing Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not eliminate or amend an existing motor carrier safety regulation related only to the maintenance, equipment, loading, or operation (including routing) of vehicles carrying material found to be hazardous under section 5103 of this title until an equivalent or more stringent regulation has been prescribed under section 5103.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures and Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A regulation under this section shall be prescribed under section 553 of title 5 (without regard to sections 556 and 557 of title 5).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After notice and an opportunity for comment, the Secretary may waive any part of a regulation prescribed under this section as it applies to a person or class of persons, if the Secretary decides that the waiver is consistent with the public interest and the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. Under this subsection, the Secretary shall waive the regulations prescribed under this section as they apply to schoolbuses (as defined in section 30125(a) of this title) unless the Secretary decides that making the regulations applicable to schoolbuses is necessary for public safety, considering all laws of the United States and States applicable to schoolbuses. A waiver under this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register, with the reasons for the waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Commercial motor vehicle safety pilot program.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) ensure that the participants represent a broad cross-section of fleet size and drivers of eligible vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) ensure participation by qualified applicants, except to the extent limited by resources of the Secretary that are necessary to permit effective monitoring under subparagraph (G).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) <cap-smallcap>Emergencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may suspend or modify participation in the program in case of emergency.</p>
