<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures and Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A regulation under this section shall be prescribed under section 553 of title 5 (without regard to sections 556 and 557 of title 5).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) waive application to a person or commercial motor vehicle of a regulation related to commercial motor vehicle safety only because the operations of the person or vehicle are entirely in a municipality or commercial zone of a municipality.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a person was authorized to operate a commercial motor vehicle in a municipality or commercial zone of a municipality in the United States for the entire period from November 19, 1987, through November 18, 1988, and if the person is otherwise qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle, the person may operate a commercial motor vehicle entirely in a municipality or commercial zone of a municipality notwithstanding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a minimum age requirement of the United States Government for operation of the vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a medical or physical condition that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:2505(g) is omitted because 5:ch. 7 applies unless otherwise stated. Before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Not later than 18 months after October 30, 1984&rdquo; are omitted because the time period specified has expired. The words &ldquo;Subject to section 30103(a) of this title&rdquo; are added to alert the reader to that section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:479 --><p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;except that the time periods specified in this subsection shall apply to the issuance of such regulations&rdquo; are omitted because the time periods referred to do not appear in subsection (c) as enacted. The reference was probably to the time periods in a prior version of subsection (c). See S. 2174, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., &sect;6(b) (as reported by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on May 2, 1984, in S. Rept. 98&ndash;424).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the text of 49 App.:2505(d) is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(2)(C)(i), the words &ldquo;an operator&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such person&rdquo; because only a natural person can have a medical or physical condition.</p>
