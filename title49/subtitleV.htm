<p class="statutory-body">(2) The order shall describe the condition or practice, or a combination of conditions and practices, that causes the emergency situation and prescribe standards and procedures for obtaining relief from the order. This paragraph does not affect the Secretary's discretion under this section to maintain the order in effect for as long as the emergency situation exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After issuing an order under this section, the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for review of the order under section 554 of title 5. If a petition for review is filed and the review is not completed by the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the order was issued, the order stops being effective at the end of that period unless the Secretary decides in writing that the emergency situation still exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Compel Issuance of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An employee of a railroad carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce who may be exposed to imminent physical injury during that employment because of the Secretary's failure, without any reasonable basis, to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section, or the employee's authorized representative, may bring a civil action against the Secretary in a district court of the United States to compel the Secretary to issue an order. The action must be brought in the judicial district in which the emergency situation is alleged to exist, in which that employing carrier has its principal executive office, or for the District of Columbia. The Secretary's failure to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section may be reviewed only under section 706 of title 5.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;At the request of the Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;at the request of the Secretary&rdquo; in 45:439(a), and are made applicable to all of the source provisions restated in this subsection, for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;at the request of the Secretary&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are interpreted and restated to mean that the Secretary's request is to the Attorney General rather than to the district court. See H.R. Rept. No. 91&ndash;1194, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20 (1970). The words &ldquo;the Attorney General may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such district court shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (last sentence), &ldquo;The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(d)(2), and &ldquo;The United States district court shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon petition by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have jurisdiction&rdquo; in 45:439(a) for clarity and consistency. It is not necessary to restate that the district court has jurisdiction because of 28:1331 and 1345. See also the statement of Senator Prouty in 115 Cong. Rec. 40205 (1969) explaining that similar language in section 110 of S. 1933, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (the derivative source for 45:439) would grant the Attorney General the power to seek injunctions. Clauses (1)&ndash;(3) are substituted for the source provisions to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of rules 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are omitted as surplus because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.) apply in the district court unless otherwise provided. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;or an amount agreed on in compromise&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the text of 45:439(c) (words before 1st comma) is omitted because it applies only to actions brought by a State authority. See discussion of the cross-reference in the note for section 20113(c) of <!-- PDFPage:409 -->the revised title. The last sentence is substituted for &ldquo;in which the individual resides&rdquo; in 45:438(c) because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;compliance order issued under section 20111(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;order, or directive&rdquo; because the latter words are interpreted as referring to &ldquo;orders directing compliance&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (2d sentence), restated in section 20111(b).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;impose&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;assess&rdquo; for consistency.

The Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1980 was derived from S. 2730, which in turn was derived from H.R. 7104. See 126 Cong. Rec. 26535 (1980). Section 207(d) in an earlier version of H.R. 7104 was redesignated as section 207(c) during the legislative process and no section 207(d) was enacted. See H.R. Rept. No. 96&ndash;1025, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 14, 15 (1980).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; means any substance under section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802) specified by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In the interest of safety, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations and issue orders, not later than October 28, 1992, related to alcohol and controlled substances use in railroad operations. The regulations shall establish a program requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a railroad carrier to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-<!-- PDFPage:417 -->accident testing of all railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) for the use of a controlled substance in violation of law or a United States Government regulation, and to conduct reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of such employees for the use of alcohol in violation of law or a United States Government regulation; the regulations shall permit such railroad carriers to conduct preemployment testing of such employees for the use of alcohol; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the Secretary considers it appropriate, disqualification for an established period of time or dismissal of any employee found&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to have used or been impaired by alcohol when on duty; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to have used a controlled substance, whether or not on duty, except as allowed for medical purposes by law or a regulation or order under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary of Transportation considers it appropriate in the interest of safety, the Secretary may prescribe regulations and issue orders requiring railroad carriers to conduct periodic recurring testing of railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Testing and Laboratory Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall develop requirements that shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote, to the maximum extent practicable, individual privacy in the collection of specimens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for laboratories and testing procedures for controlled substances, incorporate the Department of Health and Human Services scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11, 1988, and any amendments to those guidelines, including mandatory guidelines establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comprehensive standards for every aspect of laboratory controlled substances testing and laboratory procedures to be applied in carrying out this section, including standards requiring the use of the best available technology to ensure the complete reliability and accuracy of controlled substances tests and strict procedures governing the chain of custody of specimens collected for controlled substances testing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the minimum list of controlled substances for which individuals may be tested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) appropriate standards and procedures for periodic review of laboratories and criteria for certification and revocation of certification of laboratories to perform controlled substances testing in carrying out this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require that a laboratory involved in controlled substances testing under this section have the capability and facility, at the laboratory, of performing screening and confirmation tests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that all tests indicating the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable of providing quantitative information about alcohol or a controlled substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) ensure that employees are selected for tests by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that no employee is harassed by being treated differently from other employees in similar circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Rehabilitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations or issue orders establishing requirements for rehabilitation programs that at least provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) in need of assistance in resolving problems with the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation. The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which employees shall be required to participate in a program. Each railroad carrier is encouraged to make such a program available to all of its employees in addition to employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions. This subsection does not prevent a railroad carrier from establishing a program under this subsection in cooperation with another railroad carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>International Obligations and Foreign Laws and Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall establish only requirements that are consistent with international obligations of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall consider applicable laws and regulations of foreign countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Other Regulations Allowed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not prevent the Secretary of Transportation from continuing in effect, amending, or further supplementing a regulation prescribed or order issued before October 28, 1991, governing the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in railroad operations.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;20143. Locomotive visibility</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;locomotive visibility&rdquo; means the enhancement of day and night visibility of the front end unit of a train, considering in particular the visibility and perspective of a driver of a motor vehicle at a grade crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Interim Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than December 31, 1992, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe temporary regulations identifying ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights as temporary locomotive visibility measures and authorizing and encouraging the installation and use of those lights. Subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 does not apply to a temporary regulation or to an amendment to a temporary regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Review of Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review the Secretary's regulations on locomotive visibility. Not later than December 31, 1993, the Secretary shall complete the current research of the Department of Transportation on locomotive visibility. In conducting the review, the Secretary shall collect relevant information from operational experience by rail carriers using enhanced visibility measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Regulatory Proceeding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than June 30, 1994, the Secretary shall begin a regulatory proceeding to prescribe final regulations requiring substantially enhanced locomotive visibility measures. In the proceeding, the Secretary shall consider at least&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) revisions to the existing locomotive headlight standards, including standards for placement and intensity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring the use of reflective material to enhance locomotive visibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requiring the use of additional alerting lights, including ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) requiring the use of auxiliary lights to enhance locomotive visibility when viewed from the side;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the effect of an enhanced visibility measure on the vision, health, and safety of train crew members; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) separate standards for self-propelled, push-pull, and multi-unit passenger operations without a dedicated head end locomotive.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Final Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than June 30, 1995, the Secretary shall prescribe final regulations requiring enhanced locomotive visibility measures. The Secretary shall require that not later than December 31, 1997, a locomotive not excluded from the regulations be equipped with temporary visibility measures under subsection (b) of this section or the visibility measures the final regulations require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may exclude a category of trains or rail operations from a specific visibility requirement if the Secretary decides the exclusion is in the public interest and is consistent with rail safety, including grade-crossing safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A locomotive equipped with temporary visibility measures prescribed under subsection (b) of this section when final regulations are prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection is deemed to be complying with the final regulations for 4 years after the final regulations are prescribed.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;20153. Audible warnings at highway-rail grade crossings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;highway-rail grade crossing&rdquo; includes any street or highway crossing over a line of railroad at grade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;locomotive horn&rdquo; refers to a train-borne audible warning device meeting standards specified by the Secretary of Transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;supplementary safety measure&rdquo; refers to a safety system or procedure, provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the highway-rail grade crossing, that is determined by the Secretary to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties. A traffic control arrangement that prevents careless movement over the crossing (e.g., as where adequate median barriers prevent movement around crossing gates extending over the full width of the lanes in the particular direction of travel), and that conforms to standards prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection, shall be deemed to constitute a supplementary safety measure. The following do not, individually or in combination, constitute supplementary safety measures within the meaning of this subsection: standard traffic control devices or arrangements such as reflectorized crossbucks, stop signs, flashing lights, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of railroad, or traffic signals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations requiring that a locomotive horn shall be sounded while each train is approaching and entering upon each public highway-rail grade crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In issuing such regulations, the Secretary may except from the requirement to sound the locomotive horn any categories of rail operations or categories of highway-rail grade crossings (by train speed or other factors specified by regulation)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the Secretary determines not to present a significant risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for which use of the locomotive horn as a warning measure is impractical; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for which, in the judgment of the Secretary, supplementary safety measures fully compensate for the absence of the warning provided by the locomotive horn.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to provide for safety and the quiet of communities affected by train operations, the Secretary may specify in such regulations that any supplementary safety measures must be applied to all highway-rail grade crossings within a specified distance along the railroad in order to be excepted from the requirement of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application for Waiver or Exemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may not entertain an application for waiver or exemption of the regulations issued under this section unless such application shall have been submitted jointly by the railroad carrier owning, or controlling operations over, the crossing and by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority. The Secretary shall not grant any such application unless, in the judgment of the Secretary, the application demonstrates that the safety of highway users will not be diminished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Development of Supplementary Safety Measures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In order to promote the quiet of communities affected by rail operations and the development of innovative safety measures at highway-rail grade crossings, the Secretary may, in connection with demonstration of proposed new supplementary safety measures, order railroad carriers operating over one or more crossings to cease temporarily the sounding of locomotive horns at such crossings. Any such measures shall have been subject to testing and evaluation and deemed necessary by the Secretary prior to actual use in lieu of the locomotive horn.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may include in regulations issued under this subsection special procedures for approval of new supplementary safety measures meeting the requirements of subsection (c)(1) of this section following successful demonstration of those measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Specific Rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may, by regulation, provide that the following crossings over railroad lines shall be subject, in whole or in part, to the regulations required under this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Private highway-rail grade crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Pedestrian crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Crossings utilized primarily by nonmotorized vehicles and other special vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Regulations issued under this subsection shall not apply to any location where persons are not authorized to cross the railroad.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue regulations required by this section pertaining to categories of highway-rail grade crossings that in the judgment of the Secretary pose the greatest safety hazard to rail and highway users not later than 24 months following November 2, 1994. The Secretary shall issue regulations pertaining to any other categories of crossings not later than 48 months following November 2, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Impact of Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall include in regulations prescribed under this section a concise statement of the impact of such regulations with respect to the operation of <!-- PDFPage:424 -->section 20106 of this title (national uniformity of regulation).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In issuing regulations under this section, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall take into account the interest of communities that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have in effect restrictions on the sounding of a locomotive horn at highway-rail grade crossings; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have not been subject to the routine (as defined by the Secretary) sounding of a locomotive horn at highway-rail grade crossings;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall work in partnership with affected communities to provide technical assistance and shall provide a reasonable amount of time for local communities to install supplementary safety measures, taking into account local safety initiatives (such as public awareness initiatives and highway-rail grade crossing traffic law enforcement programs) subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary, to protect public safety; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may waive (in whole or in part) any requirement of this section (other than a requirement of this subsection or subsection (j)) that the Secretary determines is not likely to contribute significantly to public safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date of Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any regulations under this section shall not take effect before the 365th day following the date of publication of the final rule.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;20161. Fostering introduction of new technology to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Collisions between highway users and trains at highway-rail grade crossings continue to cause an unacceptable loss of life, serious personal injury, and property damage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) While elimination of at-grade crossings through consolidation of crossings and grade separations offers the greatest long-term promise for optimizing the safety and efficiency of the two modes of transportation, over 140,000 public grade crossings remain on the general rail system&mdash;approximately one for each route mile on the general rail system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Conventional highway traffic control devices such as flashing lights and gates are often effective in warning motorists of a train's approach to an equipped crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Since enactment of the Highway Safety Act of 1973, over $4,200,000,000 of Federal funding has been invested in safety improvements at highway-rail grade crossings, yet a majority of public highway-rail grade crossings are not yet equipped with active warning systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The emergence of new technologies presents opportunities for more effective and affordable warnings and safer passage of highway users and trains at remaining highway-rail grade crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Implementation of new crossing safety technology will require extensive cooperation between highway authorities and railroad carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal Railroad Administration regulations establishing performance standards for processor-based signal and train control systems provide a suitable framework for qualification of new or novel technology at highway-rail grade crossings, and the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides an appropriate means of determining highway user interface with such new technology.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:430 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States to encourage the development of new technology that can prevent loss of life and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary of Transportation is designated to carry out this policy in consultation with States and necessary public and private entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Submission of New Technology Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Railroad carriers and railroad suppliers may submit for review and approval to the Secretary such new technology designed to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary shall approve by order the new technology designed to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings in accordance with Federal Railroad Administration standards for the development and use of processor-based signal and train control systems and shall consider the effects on safety of highway-user interface with the new technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Secretarial Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary approves by order new technology to provide warning to highway users at a highway-rail grade crossing and such technology is installed at a highway-rail grade crossing in accordance with the conditions of the approval, this determination preempts any State statute or regulation concerning the adequacy of the technology in providing warning at the crossing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a minimum training curriculum, and ongoing training criteria, testing, and skills evaluation measures to ensure that safety-related railroad employees, and contractor and subcontractor employees, charged with the inspection of track or railroad equipment are qualified to assess railroad compliance with Federal standards to identify defective conditions and initiate immediate remedial action to correct critical safety defects that are known to contribute to derailments, accidents, incidents, or injuries, and, in implementing the requirements of this paragraph, take into consideration existing training programs of railroad carriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review and approve the plans required under subsection (a)(2) utilizing an approval process required for programs to certify the qualification of locomotive engineers pursuant to part 240 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may exempt railroad carriers and railroad carrier contractors and subcontractors from submitting training plans for which the Secretary has issued training regulations before the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008.</p>

The order must allow the carrier a reasonable time to complete the installation. A carrier may discontinue or materially alter a signal system required under this paragraph only with the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A railroad carrier ordered under paragraph (1) of this subsection to install a signal system on one part of its railroad line may not be held negligent for not installing the system on any part of its line that was not included in the order. If an accident or incident occurs on a part of the line on which the signal system was not required to be installed and was not installed, the use of the system on another part of the line <!-- PDFPage:436 -->may not be considered in a civil action brought because of the accident or incident.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A railroad carrier may allow a signal system to be used on its railroad line only when the system, including its controlling and operating appurtenances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may be operated safely without unnecessary risk of personal injury; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a delay resulting from a cause unknown and unforeseeable to a railroad carrier or its officer or agent in charge of the employee when the employee left a terminal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the time spent waiting for deadhead transportation or in deadhead transportation from a duty assignment to the place of final release that is not time on duty, plus</p>

Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit communication necessary to notify an employee of an emergency situation, as defined by the Secretary. The Secretary may waive the requirements of this paragraph for commuter or intercity passenger railroads if the Secretary determines that such a waiver will not reduce safety and is necessary to maintain such railroads&rsquo; efficient operations and on-time performance of its trains.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a railroad carrier and its officers and agents may not require or allow its signal employees to remain or go on duty and a contractor or subcontractor to a railroad carrier and its officers and agents may not require or allow its signal employees to remain or go on duty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for a period in excess of 12 consecutive hours; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unless that employee has had at least 10 consecutive hours off duty during the prior 24 hours.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determining Time on Duty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining under subsection (a) of this section the time a signal employee is on duty or off duty, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Time on duty begins when the employee reports for duty and ends when the employee is finally released from duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Time spent performing any other service for the railroad carrier during a 24-hour period in which the employee is engaged in installing, repairing, or maintaining signal systems is time on duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Time spent returning from a trouble call, whether the employee goes directly to the employee's residence or by way of the employee's headquarters, is neither time on duty nor time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If, at the end of scheduled duty hours, an employee has not completed the trip from the final outlying worksite of the duty period to the employee's headquarters or directly to the employee's residence, the time after the scheduled duty hours necessarily spent in completing the trip to the residence or headquarters is neither time on duty nor time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If an employee is released from duty at an outlying worksite before the end of the employee's scheduled duty hours to comply with this section, the time necessary for the trip from the worksite to the employee's headquarters or directly to the employee's residence is neither time on duty nor time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Time spent in transportation on an ontrack vehicle, including time referred to in paragraphs (3)&ndash;(5) of this subsection, is time on duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A regularly scheduled meal period or another release period of at least 30 minutes but not more than one hour is time off duty and does not break the continuity of service of the employee under this section, but a release period of more than one hour is time off duty and does break the continuity of service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Emergencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A signal employee may be allowed to remain or go on duty for not more than 4 additional hours in any period of 24 consecutive hours when an emergency exists and the work of that employee is related to the emergency. In this subsection, an emergency ends when the signal system is restored to service. A signal employee may not be allowed to remain or go on duty under the emergency authority provided under this subsection to conduct routine repairs, routine maintenance, or routine inspection of signal systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Communication During Time Off Duty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During a signal employee's minimum off-duty period of 10 consecutive hours, as provided under subsection (a), a railroad carrier or a contractor or subcontractor to a railroad carrier, and its officers and agents, shall not communicate with the signal employee by telephone, by pager, or in any other manner that could reasonably be expected to disrupt the employee's rest. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit communication necessary to notify an employee of an emergency situation, as defined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exclusivity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The hours of service, duty hours, and rest periods of signal employees shall be governed exclusively by this chapter. Signal employees operating motor vehicles shall not be subject to any hours of service rules, duty hours or rest period rules promulgated by any Federal authority, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, other than the Federal Railroad Administration.</p>

Such regulations and orders may address railroad operating and scheduling practices, including unscheduled duty calls, communications during time off duty, and time spent waiting for deadhead transportation or in deadhead transportation from a duty assignment to the place of final release, that could affect employee fatigue and railroad safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In issuing regulations under subsection (a) the Secretary shall consider scientific and medical research related to fatigue and fatigue abatement, railroad scheduling and operating practices that improve safety or reduce employee fatigue, a railroad's use of new or novel technology intended to reduce or eliminate human error, the variations in freight and passenger railroad scheduling practices and operating conditions, the variations in duties and operating conditions for employees subject to this chapter, a railroad's required or voluntary use of fatigue management plans covering employees subject to this chapter, and any other relevant factors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A pilot project at a railroad or railroad facility to evaluate the efficacy of communicating to employees notice of their assigned shift time 10 hours prior to the beginning of their assigned shift as a method for reducing employee fatigue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A pilot project at a railroad or railroad facility to evaluate the efficacy of requiring railroads who use employee scheduling practices that subject employees to periods of unscheduled duty calls to assign employees to defined or specific unscheduled call shifts that are followed by shifts not subject to call, as a method for reducing employee fatigue.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the first 2 sentences are substituted for 45:438(a) and (c) (1st sentence) for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;(including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 1:1 and because the provision being violated indicates to whom it applies. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in 45:438(c) (1st sentence) is retained from the source provisions. For a discussion of whether the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to impose a penalty is mandatory or permissive, see <em>Railway Labor Executives&rsquo; Ass'n</em> v. <em>Dole</em>, 760 F.2d 1021, 1024, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985); H.R. Conf. Rept. No. 100&ndash;637, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20; 134 Cong. Rec. H3470, May 23, 1988 (daily ed.); 134 Cong. Rec. S7510, June 9, 1988 (daily ed.). See also 134 Cong. Rec. E1946, June 10, 1988 (daily ed.). For an extended discussion of FRA's prosecutorial discretion, see <em>Nationwide Rail Safety: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Transportation, Tourism, and Hazardous Materials of the House Energy and Commerce Committee</em>, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 54&ndash;65 (1987). See also section 6 of this bill that provides that this bill restates, without substantive change, the provisions of law replaced by this bill, and that this bill may not be construed as making a substantive change in the law restated. Therefore, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this subsection has the same meaning it has under existing <!-- PDFPage:450 -->law. The words &ldquo;A separate violation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a separate offense&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;may compromise the amount .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to not less than $500&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may, however, be compromised .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for any amount, but in no event for an amount less than the minimum provided in subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (B), the words &ldquo;prior or subsequent&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;deposited in&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;covered into&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of Program.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall establish a program for making capital grants to class II and class III railroads. Such grants shall be for projects in the public interest that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) rehabilitate, preserve, or improve railroad track (including roadbed, bridges, and related track structures) used primarily for freight transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) facilitate the continued or greater use of railroad transportation for freight shipments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) reduce the use of less fuel efficient modes of transportation in the transportation of such shipments; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) demonstrate innovative technologies and advanced research and development that increase fuel economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lower the costs of operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Provision of grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Grants may be provided under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) directly to the class II or class III railroad; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with the concurrence of the class II or class III railroad, to a State or local government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>State cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Class II and class III railroad applicants for a grant under this chapter are encouraged to utilize the expertise and assistance of State transportation agencies in applying for and administering such grants. State transportation agencies are encouraged to provide such expertise and assistance to such railroads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than October 1, 2008, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to implement the program under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Federal Share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The maximum Federal share for carrying out a project under this section shall be 80 percent of the project cost. The non-Federal share may be provided by any non-Federal source in cash, equipment, or supplies. Other in-kind contributions may be approved by the Secretary on a case-by-case basis consistent with this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Use of Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Grants provided under this section shall be used to implement track capital projects as soon as possible. In no event shall grant funds be contractually obligated for a project later than the end of the third Federal fiscal year following the year in which the grant was awarded. Any funds not so obligated by the end of such fiscal year shall be returned to the Secretary for reallocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Employee Protection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require as a condition of any grant made under this section that the recipient railroad provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees who are affected by the project to be funded with the grant as the terms imposed under section 11326(a), as in effect on the date of the enactment of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Labor Standards.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Prevailing wages</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall ensure that laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors in construction work financed by a grant made under this section will be paid wages not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor under subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Davis-Bacon Act&rdquo;). The Secretary shall make a grant under this section only after being assured that required labor standards will be maintained on the construction work.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:460 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Wage rates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Wage rates in a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) are deemed for purposes of this subsection to comply with the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#22301_1_target" name="22301_1">1</a></sup> subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall conduct a study of the projects carried out with grant assistance under this section to determine the extent to which the program helps promote a reduction in fuel use associated with the transportation of freight and demonstrates innovative technologies that increase fuel economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lower the costs of operation. Not later than March 31, 2009, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the study, including any recommendations the Secretary considers appropriate regarding the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2011 for carrying out this section.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Public convenience and necessity require that Amtrak, to the extent its budget allows, provide modern, cost-efficient, and energy-efficient intercity rail passenger transportation between crowded urban areas and in other areas of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Rail passenger transportation can help alleviate overcrowding of airways and airports and on highways.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A traveler in the United States should have the greatest possible choice of transportation most convenient to the needs of the traveler.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A greater degree of cooperation is necessary among Amtrak, other rail carriers, State, regional, and local governments, the private sector, labor organizations, and suppliers of services and equipment to Amtrak to achieve a performance level sufficient to justify expending public money.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Modern and efficient commuter rail passenger transportation is important to the viability and well-being of major urban areas and to the energy conservation and self-sufficiency goals of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) As a rail passenger transportation entity, Amtrak should be available to operate commuter rail passenger transportation through its subsidiary, Amtrak Commuter, under contract with commuter authorities that do not provide the transportation themselves as part of the governmental function of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Northeast Corridor is a valuable resource of the United States used by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation and freight transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Greater coordination between intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Mission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The mission of Amtrak is to provide efficient and effective intercity passenger rail mobility consisting of high quality service that is trip-time competitive with other intercity travel options and that is consistent with the goals of subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Goals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use its best business judgment in acting to minimize United States Government subsidies, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increasing fares;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increasing revenue from the transportation of mail and express;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) reducing losses on food service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) improving its contracts with operating rail carriers;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:464 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) reducing management costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increasing employee productivity;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24308. Use of facilities and providing services to Amtrak</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak may make an agreement with a rail carrier or regional transportation authority to use facilities of, and have services provided by, the carrier or authority under terms on which the parties agree. The terms shall include a penalty for untimely performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the parties cannot agree and if the Surface Transportation Board finds it necessary to carry out this part, the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) order that the facilities be made available and the services provided to Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) prescribe reasonable terms and compensation for using the facilities and providing the services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When prescribing reasonable compensation under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Board shall consider quality of service as a major factor when determining whether, and the extent to which, the amount of compensation shall be greater than the incremental costs of using the facilities and providing the services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Board shall decide the dispute not later than 90 days after Amtrak submits the dispute to the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak's right to use the facilities or have the services provided is conditioned on payment of the compensation. If the compensation is not paid promptly, the rail carrier or authority entitled to it may bring an action against Amtrak to recover the amount owed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Amtrak shall seek immediate and appropriate legal remedies to enforce its contract rights when track maintenance on a route over which Amtrak operates falls below the contractual standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Operating During Emergencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To facilitate operation by Amtrak during an emergency, the Board, on application by Amtrak, shall require a rail carrier to provide facilities immediately during the emergency. The Board then shall promptly prescribe reasonable terms, including indemnification of the carrier by Amtrak against personal injury risk to which the carrier may be exposed. The rail carrier shall provide the facilities for the duration of the emergency.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:484 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preference Over Freight Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except in an emergency, intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation provided by or for Amtrak has preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, junction, or crossing unless the Board orders otherwise under this subsection. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may apply to the Board for relief. If the Board, after an opportunity for a hearing under section 553 of title 5, decides that preference for intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation materially will lessen the quality of freight transportation provided to shippers, the Board shall establish the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on reasonable terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Accelerated Speeds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a rail carrier refuses to allow accelerated speeds on trains operated by or for Amtrak, Amtrak may apply to the Board for an order requiring the carrier to allow the accelerated speeds. The Board shall decide whether accelerated speeds are unsafe or impracticable and which improvements would be required to make accelerated speeds safe and practicable. After an opportunity for a hearing, the Board shall establish the maximum allowable speeds of Amtrak trains on terms the Board decides are reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Additional Trains</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When a rail carrier does not agree to provide, or allow Amtrak to provide, for the operation of additional trains over a rail line of the carrier, Amtrak may apply to the Board for an order requiring the carrier to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains. After a hearing on the record, the Board may order the carrier, within 60 days, to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains on a schedule based on legally permissible operating times. However, if the Board decides not to hold a hearing, the Board, not later than 30 days after receiving the application, shall publish in the Federal Register the reasons for the decision not to hold the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when conducting a hearing, whether an order would impair unreasonably freight transportation of the rail carrier, with the carrier having the burden of demonstrating that the additional trains will impair the freight transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when establishing scheduled running times, the statutory goal of Amtrak to implement schedules that attain a system-wide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be adhered to with a high degree of reliability and passenger comfort.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Unless the parties have an agreement that establishes the compensation Amtrak will pay the carrier for additional trains provided under an order under this subsection, the Board shall decide the dispute under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Passenger Train Performance and Other Standards.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Investigation of substandard performance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the on-time performance of any intercity passenger train averages less than 80 percent for any 2 consecutive calendar quarters, or the service quality of intercity passenger train operations for which minimum standards are established under section 207 of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 fails to meet those standards for 2 consecutive calendar quarters, the Surface Transportation Board (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) may initiate an investigation, or upon the filing of a complaint by Amtrak, an intercity passenger rail operator, a host freight railroad over which Amtrak operates, or an entity for which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service, the Board shall initiate such an investigation, to determine whether and to what extent delays or failure to achieve minimum standards are due to causes that could reasonably be addressed by a rail carrier over whose tracks the intercity passenger train operates or reasonably addressed by Amtrak or other intercity passenger rail operators. As part of its investigation, the Board has authority to review the accuracy of the train performance data and the extent to which scheduling and congestion contribute to delays. In making its determination or carrying out such an investigation, the Board shall obtain information from all parties involved and identify reasonable measures and make recommendations to improve the service, quality, and on-time performance of the train.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Problems caused by host rail carrier</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Board determines that delays or failures to achieve minimum standards investigated under paragraph (1) are attributable to a rail carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak over freight transportation as required under subsection (c), the Board may award damages against the host rail carrier, including prescribing such other relief to Amtrak as it determines to be reasonable and appropriate pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Damages and relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In awarding damages and prescribing other relief under this subsection the Board shall consider such factors as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the extent to which Amtrak suffers financial loss as a result of host rail carrier delays or failure to achieve minimum standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) what reasonable measures would adequately deter future actions which may reasonably be expected to be likely to result in delays to Amtrak on the route involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Use of damages</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall, as it deems appropriate, order the host rail carrier to remit the damages awarded under this subsection to Amtrak or to an entity for which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service. Such damages shall be used for capital or operating expenditures on the routes over which delays or failures to achieve minimum standards were the result of a rail carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak over freight transportation as determined in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;facility&rdquo; means a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, facility, or real property related to a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, or facility, including a signal system, passenger station and repair tracks, a station building, a platform, and a related facility, including a water, fuel, steam, electric, and air line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) downgrading a facility means reducing a track classification as specified in the Federal Railroad Administration track safety standards or altering a facility so that the time required for rail passenger transportation to be provided over the route on which a facility is located may be increased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval Required for Downgrading or Disposal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A facility of a rail carrier or regional transportation authority that Amtrak used to provide rail passenger transportation on February 1, 1979, or on January 1, 1997, may be downgraded or disposed of only after approval by the Secretary of Transportation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification and Analysis</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A rail carrier intending to downgrade or dispose of a facility Amtrak currently is not using to provide transportation shall notify Amtrak of its intention. If, not later than 60 days after Amtrak receives the notice, Amtrak and the carrier do not agree to retain or maintain the facility or to convey an interest in the facility to Amtrak, the carrier may apply to the Secretary for approval to downgrade or dispose of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a rail carrier notifies Amtrak of its intention to downgrade or dispose of a facility, Amtrak shall survey population centers with rail passenger transportation facilities to assist in preparing a valid and timely analysis of the need for the facility and shall update the survey as appropriate. Amtrak also shall maintain a system for collecting information gathered in the survey. The system shall collect the information based on geographic regions and on whether the facility would be part of a short haul or long haul route. The survey should facilitate an analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ridership potential by ascertaining existing and changing travel patterns that would provide maximum efficient rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quality of transportation of competitors or likely competitors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the likelihood of Amtrak offering transportation at a competitive fare;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) opportunities to target advertising and fares to potential classes of riders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) economic characteristics of rail passenger transportation related to the facility and the extent to which the characteristics are consistent with sound economic principles of short haul or long haul rail transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the feasibility of applying effective internal cost controls to the facility and route served by the facility to improve the ratio of passenger revenue to transportation expenses (excluding maintenance of tracks, structures, and equipment and depreciation).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Approval of Application and Payment of Avoidable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If Amtrak does not object to an application not later than 30 days after it is submitted, the Secretary shall approve the application promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If Amtrak objects to an application, the Secretary shall decide by not later than 180 days after the objection those costs the rail carrier may avoid if it does not have to retain or maintain a facility in the condition Amtrak requests. If Amtrak does not agree by not later than 60 days after the decision to pay the carrier these avoidable costs, the Secretary shall approve the application. When deciding whether to pay a carrier the avoidable costs of retaining or maintaining a facility, Amtrak shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the potential importance of restoring rail passenger transportation on the route on which the facility is located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the market potential of the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the availability, adequacy, and energy efficiency of an alternate rail line or alternate mode of transportation to provide passenger transportation to or near the places that would be served by the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the extent to which major population centers would be served by the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the extent to which providing transportation over the route would encourage the expansion of an intercity rail passenger system in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the possibility of increased ridership on a rail line that connects with the route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Other Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Downgrading or disposing of a facility under this section does not relieve a rail carrier from complying with its other common carrier or legal obligations related to the facility.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24311. Acquiring interests in property by eminent domain</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent financial resources are available, Amtrak may acquire by eminent domain under subsection (b) of this section interests in property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, except property of a rail carrier, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a governmental authority; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requested by the Secretary of Transportation in carrying out the Secretary's duty to design and build an intermodal transportation terminal at Union Station in the District of Columbia if the Secretary assures Amtrak that the Secretary will reimburse Amtrak.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak may exercise the power of eminent domain only if it cannot&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquire the interest in the property by contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) agree with the owner on the purchase price for the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A civil action to acquire an interest in property by eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section must be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the property is located or, if a single piece of property is located in more than one judicial district, in any judicial district in which any piece of the property is located. An interest is condemned and taken by Amtrak for its use when a declaration of taking is filed under this subsection and an amount of money estimated in the declaration to be just compensation for the interest is deposited in the court. The declaration may be filed with the complaint in the action or at any time before judgment. The declaration must contain or be accompanied by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of the public use for which the interest is taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of the property sufficient to identify it;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a statement of the interest in the property taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a plan showing the interest taken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a statement of the amount of money Amtrak estimates is just compensation for the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the declaration is filed and the deposit is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, title to the property vests in Amtrak in fee simple absolute or in the lesser interest shown in the declaration, and the right to the money vests in the person entitled to the money. When the declaration is filed, the court may decide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the time by which, and the terms under which, possession of the property is given to Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the disposition of outstanding charges related to the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After a hearing, the court shall make a finding on the amount that is just compensation for the interest in the property and enter judgment awarding that amount and interest on it. The rate of interest is 6 percent a year and is computed on the amount of the award less the amount deposited in the court from the date of taking to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) On application of a party, the court may order immediate payment of any part of the amount deposited in the court for the compensation to be awarded. If the award is more than the amount received, the court shall enter judgment against Amtrak for the deficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Condemn Rail Carrier Property Interests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If Amtrak and a rail carrier cannot agree on a sale to Amtrak of an <!-- PDFPage:488 -->interest in property of a rail carrier necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, Amtrak may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order establishing the need of Amtrak for the interest and requiring the carrier to convey the interest on reasonable terms, including just compensation. The need of Amtrak is deemed to be established, and the Commission, after holding an expedited proceeding and not later than 120 days after receiving the application, shall order the interest conveyed unless the Commission decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conveyance would impair significantly the ability of the carrier to carry out its obligations as a common carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the obligations of Amtrak to provide modern, efficient, and economical rail passenger transportation can be met adequately by acquiring an interest in other property, either by sale or by exercising its right of eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the amount of compensation is not determined by the date of the Commission's order, the order shall require, as part of the compensation, interest at 6 percent a year from the date prescribed for the conveyance until the compensation is paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak subsequently may reconvey to a third party an interest conveyed to Amtrak under this subsection or prior comparable provision of law if the Commission decides that the reconveyance will carry out the purposes of this part, regardless of when the proceeding was brought (including a proceeding pending before a United States court on November 28, 1990).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Managing Costs and Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall manage its operating costs, pricing policies, and other factors with the goal of having revenues derived each fiscal year from providing intercity rail passenger transportation over the Northeast Corridor route between the District of Columbia and Boston, Massachusetts, equal at least the operating costs of providing that transportation in that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Priorities in Selecting and Scheduling Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When selecting and scheduling specific projects, Amtrak shall apply the following considerations, in the following order of priority:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Safety-related items should be completed before other items because the safety of the passengers and users of the Northeast Corridor is paramount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Activities that benefit the greatest number of passengers should be completed before activities involving fewer passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Reliability of intercity rail passenger transportation must be emphasized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Trip-time requirements of this section must be achieved to the extent compatible with the priorities referred to in paragraphs (1)&ndash;(3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Improvements that will pay for the investment by achieving lower operating or maintenance costs should be carried out before other improvements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Construction operations should be scheduled so that the fewest possible passengers are inconvenienced, transportation is maintained, and the on-time performance of Northeast Corridor commuter rail passenger and rail freight transportation is optimized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Planning should focus on completing activities that will provide immediate benefits to users of the Northeast Corridor.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) rail transportation is an essential component of the North American intermodal transportation system;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the development of economically strong and socially stable communities in the western United States and Canada was encouraged significantly by government policies promoting the development of integrated transcontinental, interstate and interprovincial rail systems in the States, territories and provinces of the two countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) United States and Canadian federal support for the completion of new elements of the transcontinental, interstate and interprovincial rail systems was halted before rail connections were established to the State of Alaska and the Yukon Territory;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas facilitates controlled access and may reduce overall impact to environmentally sensitive areas;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the extension of the continental rail system through northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory to the current terminus of the Alaska Railroad would significantly benefit the United States and Canadian visitor industries by facilitating the comfortable movement of passengers over long distances while minimizing effects on the surrounding areas; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) ongoing research and development efforts in the rail industry continue to increase the efficiency of rail transportation, ensure safety, and decrease the impact of rail service on the environment.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 303. AGREEMENT FOR A UNITED STATES-CANADA BILATERAL COMMISSION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The President is authorized and urged to enter into an agreement with the Government of Canada to establish an independent joint commission to study the feasibility and advisability of linking the rail system in Alaska to the nearest appropriate point on the North American continental rail system.</p>
