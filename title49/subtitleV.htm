<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Ordering Restrictions and Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, through testing, inspection, investigation, or research carried out under this chapter, the Secretary of Transportation decides that an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, causes an emergency situation involving a hazard of death or personal injury, the Secretary immediately may order restrictions and prohibitions, without regard to section 20103(e) of this title, that may be necessary to abate the situation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The order shall describe the condition or practice, or a combination of conditions and practices, that causes the emergency situation and prescribe standards and procedures for obtaining relief from the order. This paragraph does not affect the Secretary's discretion under this section to maintain the order in effect for as long as the emergency situation exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After issuing an order under this section, the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for review of the order under section 554 of title 5. If a petition for review is filed and the review is not completed by the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the order was issued, the order stops being effective at the end of that period unless the Secretary decides in writing that the emergency situation still exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Compel Issuance of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An employee of a railroad carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce who may be exposed to imminent physical injury during that employment because of the Secretary's failure, without any reasonable basis, to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section, or the employee's authorized representative, may bring a civil action against the Secretary in a district court of the United States to compel the Secretary to issue an order. The action must be brought in the judicial district in which the emergency situation is alleged to exist, in which that employing carrier has its principal executive office, or for the District of Columbia. The Secretary's failure to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section may be reviewed only under section 706 of title 5.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Investigative and Surveillance Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe investigative and surveillance activities necessary to enforce the safety regulations prescribed and orders issued by the Secretary that apply to railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in a State. The State may participate in those activities when the safety practices for railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in the State are regulated by a State authority and the authority submits to the Secretary an annual certification as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Annual Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State authority's annual certification must include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a certification that the authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has regulatory jurisdiction over the safety practices for railroad equipment, fa<!-- PDFPage:274 -->cilities, rolling stock, and operations in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) was given a copy of each safety regulation prescribed and order issued by the Secretary, that applies to the equipment, facilities, rolling stock, or operations, as of the date of certification; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is conducting the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a report, in the form the Secretary prescribes by regulation, that includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the name and address of each railroad carrier subject to the safety jurisdiction of the authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) each accident or incident reported during the prior 12 months by a railroad carrier involving a fatality, personal injury requiring hospitalization, or property damage of more than $750 (or a higher amount prescribed by the Secretary), and a summary of the authority's investigation of the cause and circumstances surrounding the accident or incident;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the record maintenance, reporting, and inspection practices conducted by the authority to aid the Secretary in enforcing railroad safety regulations prescribed and orders issued by the Secretary, including the number of inspections made of railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations by the authority during the prior 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) other information the Secretary requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annual certification applies to a safety regulation prescribed or order issued after the date of the certification only if the State authority submits an appropriate certification to provide the necessary investigative and surveillance activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, after receipt of an annual certification, the Secretary decides the State authority is not complying satisfactorily with the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may reject any part of the certification or take other appropriate action to achieve adequate enforcement. The Secretary must give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking action under this paragraph. When the Secretary gives notice, the burden of proof is on the authority to show that it is complying satisfactorily with the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Agreement When Certification Not Received</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary does not receive an annual certification under subsection (a) of this section related to any railroad equipment, facility, rolling stock, or operation, the Secretary may make an agreement with a State authority for the authority to provide any part of the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed by the Secretary as necessary to enforce the safety regulations and orders applicable to the equipment, facility, rolling stock, or operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may terminate any part of an agreement made under this subsection on finding that the authority has not provided every part of the investigative and surveillance activities to which the agreement relates. The Secretary must give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before making such a finding. The finding and termination shall be published in the Federal Register and may not become effective for at least 15 days after the date of publication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Agreement for Investigative and Surveillance Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to providing for State participation under this section, the Secretary may make an agreement with a State to provide investigative and surveillance activities related to the Secretary's duties under chapters 203&ndash;213 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Payment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On application by a State authority that has submitted a certification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section or made an agreement under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, the Secretary shall pay not more than 50 percent of the cost of the personnel, equipment, and activities of the authority needed, during the next fiscal year, to carry out a safety program under the certification or agreement. However, the Secretary may pay an authority only when the authority assures the Secretary that it will provide the remaining cost of the safety program and that the total State money expended for the safety program, excluding grants of the United States Government, will be at least as much as the average amount expended for the fiscal years that ended June 30, 1969, and June 30, 1970.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may monitor State investigative and surveillance practices and carry out other inspections and investigations necessary to help enforce this chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;At the request of the Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;at the request of the Secretary&rdquo; in 45:439(a), and are made applicable to all of the source provisions restated in this subsection, for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;at the request of the Secretary&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are interpreted and restated to mean that the Secretary's request is to the Attorney General rather than to the district court. See H.R. Rept. No. 91&ndash;1194, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20 (1970). The words &ldquo;the Attorney General may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such district court shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (last sentence), &ldquo;The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(d)(2), and &ldquo;The United States district court shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon petition by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have jurisdiction&rdquo; in 45:439(a) for clarity and consistency. It is not necessary to restate that the district court has jurisdiction because of 28:1331 and 1345. See also the statement of Senator Prouty in 115 Cong. Rec. 40205 (1969) explaining that similar language in section 110 of S. 1933, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (the derivative source for 45:439) would grant the Attorney General the power to seek injunctions. Clauses (1)&ndash;(3) are substituted for the source provisions to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of rules 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are omitted as surplus because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.) apply in the district court unless otherwise provided. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;or an amount agreed on in compromise&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the text of 45:439(c) (words before 1st comma) is omitted because it applies only to actions brought by a State authority. See discussion of the cross-reference in the note for section 20113(c) of the revised title. The last sentence is substituted for &ldquo;in which the individual resides&rdquo; in 45:438(c) because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;compliance order issued under section 20111(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;order, or directive&rdquo; because the latter words are interpreted as referring to &ldquo;orders directing compli<!-- PDFPage:279 -->ance&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (2d sentence), restated in section 20111(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In the interest of safety, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations and issue orders, not later than October 28, 1992, related to alcohol and controlled substances use in railroad operations. The regulations shall establish a program requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a railroad carrier to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of all railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) for the use of a controlled substance in violation of law or a United States Government regulation, and to conduct reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of such employees for the use of alcohol in violation of law or a United States Government regulation; the regulations shall permit such railroad carriers to conduct preemployment testing of such employees for the use of alcohol; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the Secretary considers it appropriate, disqualification for an established period of time or dismissal of any employee found&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to have used or been impaired by alcohol when on duty; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to have used a controlled substance, whether or not on duty, except as allowed for medical purposes by law or a regulation or order under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary of Transportation considers it appropriate in the interest of safety, the Secretary may prescribe regulations and issue orders requiring railroad carriers to conduct periodic recurring testing of railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Testing and Laboratory Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall develop requirements that shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comprehensive standards for every aspect of laboratory controlled substances testing and laboratory procedures to be applied in carrying out this section, including standards requiring the use of the best available technology to ensure the complete reliability and accuracy of controlled substances tests and strict procedures governing the chain of custody of specimens collected for controlled substances testing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the minimum list of controlled substances for which individuals may be tested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) appropriate standards and procedures for periodic review of laboratories and criteria for certification and revocation of certification of laboratories to perform controlled substances testing in carrying out this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require that a laboratory involved in controlled substances testing under this section have the capability and facility, at the laboratory, of performing screening and confirmation tests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that all tests indicating the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable of providing quantitative information about alcohol or a controlled substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the confidentiality of test results and medical information (other than information about alcohol or a controlled substance) of employees, except that this clause does not prevent the use of test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) ensure that employees are selected for tests by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that no employee is harassed by being treated differently from other employees in similar circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Rehabilitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations or issue or<!-- PDFPage:286 -->ders establishing requirements for rehabilitation programs that at least provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Secretary) in need of assistance in resolving problems with the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a Government regulation. The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which employees shall be required to participate in a program. Each railroad carrier is encouraged to make such a program available to all of its employees in addition to employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions. This subsection does not prevent a railroad carrier from establishing a program under this subsection in cooperation with another railroad carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>International Obligations and Foreign Laws and Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Secretary of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall establish only requirements that are consistent with international obligations of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall consider applicable laws and regulations of foreign countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Other Regulations Allowed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not prevent the Secretary of Transportation from continuing in effect, amending, or further supplementing a regulation prescribed or order issued before October 28, 1991, governing the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in railroad operations.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;locomotive visibility&rdquo; means the enhancement of day and night visibility of the front end unit of a train, considering in particular the visibility and perspective of a driver of a motor vehicle at a grade crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Interim Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than December 31, 1992, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe temporary regulations identifying ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights as temporary locomotive visibility measures and authorizing and encouraging the installation and use of those lights. Subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 does not apply to a temporary regulation or to an amendment to a temporary regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Review of Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review the Secretary's regulations on locomotive visibility. Not later than December 31, 1993, the Secretary shall complete the current research of the Department of Transportation on locomotive visibility. In conducting the review, the Secretary shall collect relevant information from operational experience by rail carriers using enhanced visibility measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Regulatory Proceeding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than June 30, 1994, the Secretary shall begin a regulatory proceeding to prescribe final regulations requiring substantially enhanced locomotive visibility measures. In the proceeding, the Secretary shall consider at least&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) revisions to the existing locomotive headlight standards, including standards for placement and intensity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring the use of reflective material to enhance locomotive visibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requiring the use of additional alerting lights, including ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) requiring the use of auxiliary lights to enhance locomotive visibility when viewed from the side;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the effect of an enhanced visibility measure on the vision, health, and safety of train crew members; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) separate standards for self-propelled, push-pull, and multi-unit passenger operations without a dedicated head end locomotive.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Final Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than June 30, 1995, the Secretary shall prescribe final regulations requiring enhanced locomotive visibility measures. The Secretary shall require that not later than December 31, 1997, a locomotive not excluded from the regulations be equipped with temporary visibility measures under subsection (b) of this section or the visibility measures the final regulations require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may exclude a category of trains or rail operations from a specific visibility requirement if the Secretary decides the exclusion is in the public interest <!-- PDFPage:288 -->and is consistent with rail safety, including grade-crossing safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A locomotive equipped with temporary visibility measures prescribed under subsection (b) of this section when final regulations are prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection is deemed to be complying with the final regulations for 4 years after the final regulations are prescribed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;locomotive horn&rdquo; refers to a train-borne audible warning device meeting standards specified by the Secretary of Transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;supplementary safety measure&rdquo; refers to a safety system or procedure, provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the highway-rail grade crossing, that is determined by the Secretary to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties. A traffic control arrangement that prevents careless movement over the crossing (e.g., as where adequate median barriers prevent movement around crossing gates extending over the full width of the lanes in the particular direction of travel), and that conforms to standards prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection, shall be deemed to constitute a supplementary safety measure. The following do not, individually or in combination, constitute supplementary safety measures within the meaning of this subsection: standard traffic control devices or arrangements such as reflectorized crossbucks, stop signs, flashing lights, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of railroad, or traffic signals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations requiring that a locomotive horn shall be sounded while each train is approaching and entering upon each public highway-rail grade crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In issuing such regulations, the Secretary may except from the requirement to sound the locomotive horn any categories of rail operations or categories of highway-rail grade crossings (by train speed or other factors specified by regulation)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the Secretary determines not to present a significant risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for which use of the locomotive horn as a warning measure is impractical; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for which, in the judgment of the Secretary, supplementary safety measures fully compensate for the absence of the warning provided by the locomotive horn.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to provide for safety and the quiet of communities affected by train operations, the Secretary may specify in such regulations that any supplementary safety measures must be applied to all highway-rail grade crossings within a specified distance along the railroad in order to be excepted from the requirement of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application for Waiver or Exemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may not entertain an application for waiver or exemption of the regulations issued under this section unless such application shall have been submitted jointly by the railroad carrier owning, or controlling operations over, the crossing and by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority. The Secretary shall not grant any such application unless, in the judgment of the Secretary, the application demonstrates that the safety of highway users will not be diminished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Development of Supplementary Safety Measures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In order to promote the quiet of communities affected by rail operations and the development of innovative safety measures at highway-rail grade crossings, the Secretary may, in connection with demonstration of proposed new supplementary safety measures, order railroad carriers operating over one or more crossings to cease temporarily the sounding of locomotive horns at such crossings. Any such measures shall have been subject to testing and evaluation and deemed necessary by the Secretary prior to actual use in lieu of the locomotive horn.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may include in regulations issued under this subsection special procedures for approval of new supplementary safety measures meeting the requirements of subsection (c)(1) of this section following successful demonstration of those measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Specific Rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may, by regulation, provide that the following crossings over railroad lines shall be subject, in whole or in part, to the regulations required under this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Private highway-rail grade crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Pedestrian crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Crossings utilized primarily by nonmotorized vehicles and other special vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Regulations issued under this subsection shall not apply to any location where persons are not authorized to cross the railroad.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue regulations required by this section pertaining to categories of highway-rail grade crossings that in the judgment of the Secretary pose the greatest safety hazard to rail and highway users not later than 24 months following November 2, 1994. The Secretary shall issue regulations pertaining to any other categories of crossings not later than 48 months following November 2, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Impact of Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall include in regulations prescribed under this section a concise statement of the impact of such regulations with respect to the operation of section 20106 of this title (national uniformity of regulation).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In issuing regulations under this section, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall take into account the interest of communities that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have in effect restrictions on the sounding of a locomotive horn at highway-rail grade crossings; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have not been subject to the routine (as defined by the Secretary) sounding of a locomotive horn at highway-rail grade crossings;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall work in partnership with affected communities to provide technical assistance and shall provide a reasonable amount of time <!-- PDFPage:291 -->for local communities to install supplementary safety measures, taking into account local safety initiatives (such as public awareness initiatives and highway-rail grade crossing traffic law enforcement programs) subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary, to protect public safety; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may waive (in whole or in part) any requirement of this section (other than a requirement of this subsection or subsection (j)) that the Secretary determines is not likely to contribute significantly to public safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date of Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any regulations under this section shall not take effect before the 365th day following the date of publication of the final rule.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Installation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When the Secretary of Transportation decides after an investigation that it is necessary in the public interest, the Secretary may order a railroad carrier to install, on any part of its railroad line, a signal system that complies with requirements of the Secretary. The order must allow the carrier a reasonable time to complete the installation. A carrier may discontinue or materially alter a signal system required under this paragraph only with the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A railroad carrier ordered under paragraph (1) of this subsection to install a signal system on one part of its railroad line may not be held negligent for not installing the system on any part of its line that was not included in the order. If an accident or incident occurs on a part of the line on which the signal system was not required to be installed and was not installed, the use of the system on another part of the line may not be considered in a civil action brought because of the accident or incident.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A railroad carrier may allow a signal system to be used on its railroad line only when the system, including its controlling and operating appurtenances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may be operated safely without unnecessary risk of personal injury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has been inspected and can meet any test prescribed under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) become familiar, so far as practicable, with the condition of every locomotive and tender and its parts and appurtenances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inspect every locomotive and tender and its parts and appurtenances as necessary to carry out this chapter, but not necessarily at stated times or at regular intervals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that every railroad carrier makes inspections of locomotives and tenders and their parts and appurtenances as required by regulations prescribed by the Secretary and repairs every defect that is disclosed by an inspection before a defective locomotive, tender, part, or appurtenance is used again.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Noncomplying Locomotives, Tenders, and Parts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When the Secretary finds that a locomotive, tender, or locomotive or tender part or appurtenance owned or operated by a railroad carrier does not comply with this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter, the Secretary shall give the carrier written notice describing any defect resulting in noncompliance. Not later than 5 days after receiving the notice of noncompliance, the carrier may submit a written request for a reinspection. On receiving the request, the Secretary shall provide for the reinspection by an officer or employee of the Department of Transportation who did not make the original inspection. The reinspection shall be made not later than 15 days after the date the Secretary gives the notice of noncompliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Immediately after the reinspection is completed, the Secretary shall give written notice to the railroad carrier stating whether the locomotive, tender, part, or appurtenance is in compliance. If the original finding of noncompliance is sustained, the carrier has 30 days after receipt of the notice to file an appeal with the Secretary. If the carrier files an appeal, the Secretary, after providing an opportunity for a proceeding, may revise or set aside the finding of noncompliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A locomotive, tender, part, or appurtenance found not in compliance under this subsection may be used only after it is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) repaired to comply with this chapter and regulations prescribed under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) found on reinspection or appeal to be in compliance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A railroad carrier shall make and keep, in the way the Secretary prescribes by regulation, a report of every&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inspection made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) repair made of a defect disclosed by such an inspection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Changes in Inspection Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A railroad carrier may change a rule or instruction of the carrier governing the inspection by the carrier of the locomotives and tenders and locomotive and tender parts and appurtenances of the carrier when the Secretary approves a request filed by the carrier to make the change.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In paragraph (2)(C) of this subsection, &ldquo;24-hour period&rdquo; means the period beginning when a signal employee reports for duty immediately after 8 consecutive hours off duty or, when required under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, after 10 consecutive hours off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a railroad carrier and its officers and agents may not require or allow a signal employee to remain or go on duty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) unless that employee has had at least 8 consecutive hours off duty during the prior 24 hours;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after that employee has been on duty for 12 consecutive hours, until that employee has had at least 10 consecutive hours off duty; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) after that employee has been on duty a total of 12 hours during a 24-hour period, or after the end of that 24-hour period, whichever occurs first, until that employee has had at least 8 consecutive hours off duty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determining Time on Duty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining under subsection (a) of this section the time a signal employee is on duty or off duty, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Time on duty begins when the employee reports for duty and ends when the employee is finally released from duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Time spent performing any other service for the railroad carrier during a 24-hour period in which the employee is engaged in installing, repairing, or maintaining signal systems is time on duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Time spent returning from a trouble call, whether the employee goes directly to the employee's residence or by way of the employee's headquarters, is neither time on duty nor time off duty, except that up to one hour of that time spent returning from the final trouble call of a period of continuous or broken service is time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If, at the end of scheduled duty hours, an employee has not completed the trip from the final outlying worksite of the duty period to the employee's headquarters or directly to the employee's residence, the time after the scheduled duty hours necessarily spent in completing the trip to the residence or headquarters is neither time on duty nor time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If an employee is released from duty at an outlying worksite before the end of the employee's scheduled duty hours to comply with this section, the time necessary for the trip from the worksite to the employee's headquarters or directly to the employee's residence is neither time on duty nor time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Time spent in transportation on an ontrack vehicle, including time referred to in paragraphs (3)&ndash;(5) of this subsection, is time on duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A regularly scheduled meal period or another release period of at least 30 minutes but not more than one hour is time off duty and does not break the continuity of service of the employee under this section, but a release period of more than one hour is time off duty and does break the continuity of service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Emergencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A signal employee may be allowed to remain or go on duty for not more than 4 additional hours in any period of 24 consecutive hours when an emergency exists and the work of that employee is related to the emergency. In this subsection, an emergency ends when the signal system is restored to service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A railroad carrier or railroad carriers and all labor organizations representing any class or craft of directly affected covered service employees of the railroad carrier or railroad carriers, may jointly petition the Secretary of Transportation for approval of a waiver, in whole or in part, of compliance with this chapter, to enable the establishment of one or more pilot projects to demonstrate the possible benefits of implementing alternatives to the strict application of the requirements of this chapter to such class or craft of employees, including requirements concerning maximum on-duty and minimum off-duty periods. Based on such a joint petition, the Secretary may, after notice and opportunity for comment, waive in whole or in part compliance with this chapter for a period of no more than two years, if the Secretary determines that such waiver of compliance is in the public interest and is consistent with railroad safety. Any such waiver may, based on a new petition, be extended for additional periods of up to two years, after notice and opportunity for comment. An explanation of any waiver granted under this section shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>

Subject to section 21304 of this title, a person violating a regulation prescribed or order issued by the Secretary under chapter 201 is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty. The Secretary shall impose the penalty applicable under paragraph (2) of this subsection. A separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall include in, or make applicable to, each regulation prescribed and order issued under chapter 201 of this title a civil penalty for a violation. The amount of the penalty shall be at least $500 but not more than $10,000. However, when a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has caused an imminent hazard of death or injury to individuals, or has caused death or injury, the amount may be not more than $20,000.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:305 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may compromise the amount of a civil penalty imposed under this subsection to not less than $500 before referring the matter to the Attorney General for collection.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;impose&rdquo; and &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;assessed&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the first 2 sentences are substituted for 45:438(a) and (c) (1st sentence) for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;(including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 1:1 and because the provision being violated indicates to whom it applies. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in 45:438(c) (1st sentence) is retained from the source provisions. For a discussion of whether the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to impose a penalty is mandatory or permissive, see <em>Railway Labor Executives&rsquo; Ass'n</em> v. <em>Dole</em>, 760 F.2d 1021, 1024, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985); H.R. Conf. Rept. No. 100&ndash;637, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20; 134 Cong. Rec. H3470, May 23, 1988 (daily ed.); 134 Cong. Rec. S7510, June 9, 1988 (daily ed.). See also 134 Cong. Rec. E1946, June 10, 1988 (daily ed.). For an extended discussion of FRA's prosecutorial discretion, see <em>Nationwide Rail Safety: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Transportation, Tourism, and Hazardous Materials of the House Energy and Commerce Committee</em>, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 54&ndash;65 (1987). See also section 6 of this bill that provides that this bill restates, without substantive change, the provisions of law replaced by this bill, and that this bill may not be construed as making a substantive change in the law restated. Therefore, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this subsection has the same meaning it has under existing law. The words &ldquo;A separate violation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a separate offense&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;may compromise the amount .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to not less than $500&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may, however, be compromised .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for any amount, but in no event for an amount less than the minimum provided in subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (B), the words &ldquo;prior or subsequent&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;deposited in&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;covered into&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to section 21304 of this title, a person violating chapter 211 of this title, or violating any provision of a waiver applicable to that person that has been granted under section 21108 of this title, is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty. An act by an individual that causes a railroad carrier to be in violation is a violation. For a violation of section 21106 of this title, a separate violation occurs for each day a facility is not in compliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation imposes a civil penalty under this subsection. The amount of the penalty shall be at least $500 but not more than $10,000. However, when a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has caused an imminent hazard of death or injury to individuals, or has caused death or injury, the amount may be not more than $20,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may compromise the amount of the civil penalty under section 3711 of title 31. In determining the amount of a compromise, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of violations, the ability to pay, and any effect on the ability to continue to do business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) other matters that justice requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary does not compromise the amount of the civil penalty, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General for collection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Collect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Attorney General shall bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to collect a civil penalty that is referred to the Attorney General for collection under subsection (a) of this section after satisfactory information is presented to the Attorney General. The action may be brought in the judicial district in which the violation occurred or the defendant has its principal executive office. If the action is against an individual, the action also may be brought in the judicial district in which the individual resides.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A civil action under this subsection must be brought not later than 2 years after the date of the violation unless administrative notification under section 3711 of title 31 is given within that 2-year period to the person committing the violation. However, even if notification is given, the action must be brought within the period specified in section 2462 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Imputation of Knowledge</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any proceeding under this section, a railroad carrier is deemed to know the acts of its officers and agents.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;22101. Financial assistance for State projects</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall provide financial assistance to a State, as provided under this chapter, for a rail freight assistance project of the State when a rail carrier subject to part A of subtitle IV of this title maintains a rail line in the State. The assistance is for the cost of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) acquiring, in any way the State considers appropriate, an interest in a rail line or rail property to maintain existing, or to provide future, rail freight transportation, but only if the Surface Transportation Board has authorized, or exempted from the requirements of that authorization, the abandonment of, or the discontinuance of rail transportation on, the rail line related to the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improving and rehabilitating rail property on a rail line to the extent necessary to allow adequate and efficient rail freight transportation on the line, but only if the rail carrier certifies that the rail line related to the project carried not more than 5,000,000 gross ton-miles of freight a mile in the prior year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) building rail or rail-related facilities (including new connections between at least 2 existing rail lines, intermodal freight terminals, sidings, bridges, and relocation of existing lines) to improve the quality and efficiency of the rail freight transportation, but only if the rail carrier certifies that the rail line related to the project carried not more than 5,000,000 gross ton-miles of freight a mile in the prior year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Calculating Cost-Benefit Ratio</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish a methodology for calculating the ratio of benefits to costs of projects proposed under this chapter. In establishing the methodology, the Secretary shall consider the need for equitable treatment of different regions of the United States and different commodities transported by rail. The establishment of the methodology is committed to the discretion of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Assistance for a project shall be provided under this chapter only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a rail carrier certifies that the rail line related to the project carried more than 20 carloads a mile during the most recent year during which transportation was provided by the carrier on the line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the ratio of benefits to costs for the project, as calculated using the methodology <!-- PDFPage:310 -->established under subsection (b) of this section, is more than 1.0.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the rail carrier that provided the transportation on the rail line is no longer in existence, the applicant for the project shall provide the information required by the certification under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection in the way the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) or (2) of this subsection if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decides that the rail line has contractual guarantees of at least 40 carloads a mile for each of the first 2 years of operation of the proposed project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finds that there is a reasonable expectation that the contractual guarantees will be fulfilled.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may not receive more than 15 percent of the amounts provided in a fiscal year under this chapter. Not more than 20 percent of the amounts available under this chapter may be provided in a fiscal year for any one project.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Public convenience and necessity require that Amtrak, to the extent its budget allows, provide modern, cost-efficient, and energy-efficient intercity rail passenger transportation between crowded urban areas and in other areas of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Rail passenger transportation can help alleviate overcrowding of airways and airports and on highways.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A traveler in the United States should have the greatest possible choice of transportation most convenient to the needs of the traveler.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A greater degree of cooperation is necessary among Amtrak, other rail carriers, State, regional, and local governments, the private sector, labor organizations, and suppliers of services and equipment to Amtrak to achieve a performance level sufficient to justify expending public money.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Modern and efficient commuter rail passenger transportation is important to the viabil<!-- PDFPage:315 -->ity and well-being of major urban areas and to the energy conservation and self-sufficiency goals of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) As a rail passenger transportation entity, Amtrak should be available to operate commuter rail passenger transportation through its subsidiary, Amtrak Commuter, under contract with commuter authorities that do not provide the transportation themselves as part of the governmental function of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Northeast Corridor is a valuable resource of the United States used by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation and freight transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Greater coordination between intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;By using innovative operating and marketing concepts, Amtrak shall provide intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation that completely develops the potential of modern rail transportation to meet the intercity and commuter passenger transportation needs of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Goals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use its best business judgment in acting to minimize United States Government subsidies, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increasing fares;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increasing revenue from the transportation of mail and express;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) reducing losses on food service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) improving its contracts with operating rail carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) reducing management costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increasing employee productivity;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) minimize Government subsidies by encouraging State, regional, and local governments and the private sector to share the cost of providing rail passenger transportation, including the cost of operating facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) carry out strategies to achieve immediately maximum productivity and efficiency consistent with safe and efficient transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) operate Amtrak trains, to the maximum extent feasible, to all station stops within 15 minutes of the time established in public timetables;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) develop transportation on rail corridors subsidized by States and private parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) implement schedules based on a systemwide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be achieved with a degree of reliability and passenger comfort;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) encourage rail carriers to assist in improving intercity rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) improve generally the performance of Amtrak through comprehensive and systematic operational programs and employee incentives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) carry out policies that ensure equitable access to the Northeast Corridor by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) coordinate the uses of the Northeast Corridor, particularly intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) maximize the use of its resources, including the most cost-effective use of employees, facilities, and real property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Minimizing Government Subsidies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out subsection (c)(11) of this section, Amtrak is encouraged to make agreements with the private sector and undertake initiatives that are consistent with good business judgment and designed to maximize its revenues and minimize Government subsidies.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24308. Use of facilities and providing services to Amtrak</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak may make an agreement with a rail carrier or regional transportation authority to use facilities of, and have services provided by, the carrier or authority under terms on which the parties agree. The terms shall include a penalty for untimely performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the parties cannot agree and if the Interstate Commerce Commission finds it necessary to carry out this part, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) order that the facilities be made available and the services provided to Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) prescribe reasonable terms and compensation for using the facilities and providing the services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When prescribing reasonable compensation under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission shall consider quality of service as a major factor when determining whether, and the extent to which, the amount of compensation shall be greater than the incremental costs of using the facilities and providing the services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall decide the dispute not later than 90 days after Amtrak submits the dispute to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak's right to use the facilities or have the services provided is conditioned on payment of the compensation. If the compensation is not paid promptly, the rail carrier or authority entitled to it may bring an action against Amtrak to recover the amount owed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Amtrak shall seek immediate and appropriate legal remedies to enforce its contract rights when track maintenance on a route over which Amtrak operates falls below the contractual standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Operating During Emergencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To facilitate operation by Amtrak during an emergency, the Commission, on application by Amtrak, shall require a rail carrier to provide facilities immediately during the emergency. The Commission then shall promptly prescribe reasonable terms, including indemnification of the carrier by Amtrak against personal injury risk to which the carrier may be exposed. The rail carrier shall provide the facilities for the duration of the emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preference Over Freight Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except in an emergency, intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation provided by or for Amtrak has preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, junction, or crossing unless the Secretary of Transportation orders otherwise under this subsection. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may apply to the Secretary for relief. If the Secretary, after an opportunity for a hearing under section 553 of title 5, decides that preference for intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation materially will lessen the quality of freight transportation provided to shippers, the Secretary shall establish the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on reasonable terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Accelerated Speeds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a rail carrier refuses to allow accelerated speeds on trains operated by or for Amtrak, Amtrak may apply to the Secretary for an order requiring the carrier to allow the accelerated speeds. The Secretary shall decide whether accelerated speeds are unsafe or impracticable and which improvements would be required to make accelerated speeds safe and practicable. After an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary shall establish the maximum allowable speeds of Amtrak trains on terms the Secretary decides are reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Additional Trains</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When a rail carrier does not agree to provide, or allow Amtrak to provide, for the operation of additional trains over a rail line of the carrier, Amtrak may apply to the Secretary for an order requiring the carrier to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains. After a hearing on the record, the Secretary may order the carrier, within 60 days, to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains on a schedule based on legally permissible operating times. However, if the Secretary decides not to hold a hearing, the Secretary, not later than 30 days after receiving the application, shall publish in the Federal Register the reasons for the decision not to hold the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when conducting a hearing, whether an order would impair unreasonably freight transportation of the rail carrier, with the carrier having the burden of demonstrating that the additional trains will impair the freight transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when establishing scheduled running times, the statutory goal of Amtrak to imple<!-- PDFPage:328 -->ment schedules that attain a system-wide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be adhered to with a high degree of reliability and passenger comfort.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Unless the parties have an agreement that establishes the compensation Amtrak will pay the carrier for additional trains provided under an order under this subsection, the Commission shall decide the dispute under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification and Analysis</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A rail carrier intending to downgrade or dispose of a facility Amtrak currently is not using to provide transportation shall notify Amtrak of its intention. If, not later than 60 days after Amtrak receives the notice, Amtrak and the carrier do not agree to retain or maintain the facility or to convey an interest in the facility to Amtrak, the carrier may apply to the Secretary for approval to downgrade or dispose of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a rail carrier notifies Amtrak of its intention to downgrade or dispose of a facility, Amtrak shall survey population centers with rail passenger transportation facilities to assist in preparing a valid and timely analysis of the need for the facility and shall update the survey as appropriate. Amtrak also shall maintain a system for collecting information gathered in the survey. The system shall collect the information based on geographic regions and on whether the facility would be part of a short haul or long haul route. The survey should facilitate an analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ridership potential by ascertaining existing and changing travel patterns that would provide maximum efficient rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quality of transportation of competitors or likely competitors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the likelihood of Amtrak offering transportation at a competitive fare;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) opportunities to target advertising and fares to potential classes of riders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) economic characteristics of rail passenger transportation related to the facility and the extent to which the characteristics are consistent with sound economic principles of short haul or long haul rail transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the feasibility of applying effective internal cost controls to the facility and route served by the facility to improve the ratio of passenger revenue to transportation expenses (excluding maintenance of tracks, structures, and equipment and depreciation).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Approval of Application and Payment of Avoidable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If Amtrak does not object to an application not later than 30 days after it is submitted, the Secretary shall approve the application promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If Amtrak objects to an application, the Secretary shall decide by not later than 180 days after the objection those costs the rail carrier may avoid if it does not have to retain or maintain a facility in the condition Amtrak requests. If Amtrak does not agree by not later than 60 days after the decision to pay the carrier these avoidable costs, the Secretary shall approve the application. When deciding whether to pay a carrier the avoidable costs of retaining or maintaining a facility, Amtrak shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the potential importance of restoring rail passenger transportation on the route on which the facility is located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the market potential of the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the availability, adequacy, and energy efficiency of an alternate rail line or alternate mode of transportation to provide passenger transportation to or near the places that would be served by the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the extent to which major population centers would be served by the route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the extent to which providing transportation over the route would encourage the expansion of an intercity rail passenger system in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the possibility of increased ridership on a rail line that connects with the route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Other Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Downgrading or disposing of a facility under this section does not relieve a rail carrier from complying with its other common carrier or legal obligations related to the facility.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24311. Acquiring interests in property by eminent domain</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent financial resources are available, Amtrak may acquire by eminent domain under subsection (b) of this section interests in property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, except property of a rail carrier, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a governmental authority; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requested by the Secretary of Transportation in carrying out the Secretary's duty to design and build an intermodal transportation terminal at Union Station in the District of Columbia if the Secretary assures Amtrak that the Secretary will reimburse Amtrak.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak may exercise the power of eminent domain only if it cannot&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquire the interest in the property by contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) agree with the owner on the purchase price for the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A civil action to acquire an interest in property by eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section must be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the property is located or, if a single piece of property is located in more than one judicial district, in any judicial district in which any piece of the property is located. An interest is condemned and taken by Amtrak for its use when a declaration of taking is filed under this subsection and an amount of money estimated in the declaration to be just compensation for the interest is deposited in the court. The declaration may be filed with the complaint in the action or at any time before judgment. The declaration must contain or be accompanied by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of the public use for which the interest is taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of the property sufficient to identify it;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a statement of the interest in the property taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a plan showing the interest taken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a statement of the amount of money Amtrak estimates is just compensation for the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the declaration is filed and the deposit is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, title to the property vests in Amtrak in fee simple absolute or in the lesser interest shown in the declaration, and the right to the money vests in the person entitled to the money. When the declaration is filed, the court may decide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the time by which, and the terms under which, possession of the property is given to Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the disposition of outstanding charges related to the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After a hearing, the court shall make a finding on the amount that is just compensation for the interest in the property and enter judgment awarding that amount and interest on it. The rate of interest is 6 percent a year and is computed on the amount of the award less the amount deposited in the court from the date of taking to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) On application of a party, the court may order immediate payment of any part of the amount deposited in the court for the compensation to be awarded. If the award is more than the amount received, the court shall enter judgment against Amtrak for the deficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Condemn Rail Carrier Property Interests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If Amtrak and a rail carrier cannot agree on a sale to Amtrak of an interest in property of a rail carrier necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, Amtrak may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order establishing the need of Amtrak for the interest and requiring the carrier to convey the interest on reasonable terms, including just compensation. The need of Amtrak is deemed to be established, and the Commission, after holding an expedited proceeding and not later than 120 days after receiving the application, shall order the interest conveyed unless the Commission decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conveyance would impair significantly the ability of the carrier to carry out its obligations as a common carrier; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:331 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the obligations of Amtrak to provide modern, efficient, and economical rail passenger transportation can be met adequately by acquiring an interest in other property, either by sale or by exercising its right of eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the amount of compensation is not determined by the date of the Commission's order, the order shall require, as part of the compensation, interest at 6 percent a year from the date prescribed for the conveyance until the compensation is paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak subsequently may reconvey to a third party an interest conveyed to Amtrak under this subsection or prior comparable provision of law if the Commission decides that the reconveyance will carry out the purposes of this part, regardless of when the proceeding was brought (including a proceeding pending before a United States court on November 28, 1990).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Applications To Begin or Keep Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State, a regional or local authority, or another person may apply to Amtrak and request Amtrak to provide rail passenger transportation or keep any part of a train, route, or service that Amtrak intends to discontinue under section 24706(a) or (b) or 24707(a) or (b) of this title. An application shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) assure Amtrak that the State, authority, or person has sufficient resources to meet its share of the cost of the transportation for the time the transportation will be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contain a market analysis acceptable to Amtrak to ensure that there is adequate demand for the transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) commit the State, authority, or person to provide at least 45 percent of the short term avoidable loss of providing the transportation the first year the transportation is provided and at least 65 percent of the short term avoidable loss each of the following years, and, except as provided in section 24104(a) of this title, at least 50 percent of associated capital costs each year the transportation is provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application submitted by more than one State shall be considered in the same way as an application submitted by one State, without it being necessary for each State to comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions on Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak shall review each application submitted under subsection (a) of this section to decide whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the application complies with subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is a reasonable probability that Amtrak can provide the transportation from available resources.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak may make an agreement with an applicant under this section to begin or keep the transportation if Amtrak decides that the transportation can be provided with resources available to Amtrak. An agreement may be renewed for additional periods of not more than 2 years each.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Selecting Among Competing Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If more than one application is made for transportation consistent with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, but all the transportation applied for cannot be provided with the available resources of Amtrak, the board of directors of Amtrak shall select the transportation that best serves the public interest and can be provided with the available resources of Amtrak.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Fare Increases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Before increasing a fare applicable to transportation provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section by more than 5 percent during a 6-month period, Amtrak shall consult with officials of each State affected by the increase and explain why the increase is necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a fare increase described in paragraph (1) of this subsection takes effect 90 days after Amtrak first consults with the affected States. However, not later than 30 days after the first consultation, a State may submit proposals to Amtrak for reducing costs and increasing revenues of the transportation. Amtrak shall consider the proposals in deciding how much of the proposed increase shall go into effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Amtrak may increase a fare without regard to the restrictions of this subsection during&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the first month of a fiscal year if the authorization of appropriations and the appropriations for Amtrak are not enacted at least 90 days before the beginning of the fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the 30 days following enactment of an appropriation for Amtrak or a rescission of an appropriation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Amtrak shall notify each affected State of an increase under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph as soon as possible after Amtrak decides to increase a fare.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Determining Loss, Costs, and Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After consulting with officials of each State contributing to providing transportation under subsection (b)(2) of this section, the board shall establish the basis for determining short term avoidable loss and associated capital costs of, and revenues from, the transportation. Amtrak shall give State officials the basis for determining the loss, cost, and revenue for each route on which transportation is provided under subsection (b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts provided by Amtrak under an agreement with an applicant under subsection (b)(2) of this section that are allocated for associated capital costs remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Advertising and Promotion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 2 percent but not more than 5 percent of the revenue generated by transportation provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be used for advertising and promotion at the local level.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Routes Recommended for Discontinuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To maintain a national intercity rail passenger system in the United States and if a reduction in operating expenses can be achieved, Amtrak shall provide rail passenger transportation over each route the Secretary of Transportation recommended be discontinued under section 4 of the Amtrak Improvement Act of 1978 and may restructure a route to serve a major population center as an ending place or principal intermediate place. Transportation over a long distance route shall be maintained if the Amtrak estimate for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, was that the short term avoidable loss for each passenger mile on the route was not more than 7 cents. Transportation over a short distance route shall be maintained if the Amtrak estimate for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, was that the short term avoidable loss for each passenger mile on the route was not more than 9 cents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For all routes, Amtrak shall calculate short term avoidable loss for each passenger-mile based on consistently defined factors. Calculations shall be based on the most recent available statistics for a 90-day period, except that Amtrak may use historical information adjusted to reflect the most recent available statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Deferral of Secretary's Recommendations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To provide equivalent or improved transportation consistent with the goals of section 4(a) of the Act, Amtrak may defer carrying out a recommendation of the Secretary under section 4 of the Act that requires providing transportation over a rail line not used in intercity rail passenger transportation on May 24, 1979, requires using a new facility, or requires making a new labor agreement, until any necessary capital improvements are made in the line or facility or the agreement is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Transportation To Be Continued if Criterion Met</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall continue to provide rail passenger transportation provided under section 403(d) of the Rail Passenger Service Act before October 1, 1981, if, after considering estimated fare increases and State and local contributions to the transportation, the transportation meets the short distance route criterion under section 24705(a)(1) of this title, as adjusted. Transportation continued under this section shall be financed consistent with the method of financing in effect on September 30, 1981. If the transportation is not estimated to meet the criterion, as adjusted, Amtrak may modify or discontinue the transportation so that the criterion is met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Transportation With Short-Term Avoidable Loss</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if after September 30, 1993, and before October 1, 1995, transportation provided under subsection (a) on a route during the prior 6 months has a short-term avoidable loss (excluding the cost of providing passenger equipment needed to provide the transportation), Amtrak may choose to consider modifying or discontinuing the transportation. If Amtrak does make such a choice, Amtrak shall solicit public comment for at least 30 days on alternatives to the modification or discontinuance. Not later than 60 days after the comment period ends, Amtrak may modify or discontinue the transportation so that there is no short-term avoidable loss under this section for providing the transportation on the route.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24902. Goals and requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Northeast Corridor Improvement Plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent of amounts appropriated under section 24909 of this title, Amtrak shall carry out a Northeast Corridor improvement program to achieve the following goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish not later than September 30, 1985, regularly scheduled and dependable intercity rail passenger transportation between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Boston, Massachusetts, and New York, New York, in not more than 3 hours and 40 minutes, including intermediate stops; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) New York, New York, and the District of Columbia, in not more than 2 hours and 40 minutes, including intermediate stops;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve facilities, under route criteria approved by Congress, on routes to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Albany, New York, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, from the Northeast Corridor main line, and to Boston, Massachusetts, and New Haven, Connecticut, from Springfield, Massachusetts, to make those facilities more compatible with improved high-speed transportation provided on the Northeast Corridor main line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) improve nonoperational parts of stations, related facilities, and fencing used in intercity rail passenger transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) facilitate improvements in, and usage of, commuter rail passenger, rail rapid transit, and local public transportation, to the extent compatible with clauses (1)&ndash;(3) of this subsection and subsections (f) and (h) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) maintain and improve rail freight transportation in or adjacent to the Northeast Corridor and through-freight transportation in the Northeast Corridor, to the extent compatible with clauses (1)&ndash;(4) of this subsection and subsections (f) and (h) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) continue and improve passenger radio mobile telephone service on high-speed rail passenger transportation between Boston, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia, to the extent compatible with clauses (1)&ndash;(3) of this subsection and subsections (f) and (h) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) eliminate to the maximum extent practicable congestion in rail freight and rail passenger transportation at the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland, by rehabilitating and improving the tunnel and the rail lines approaching the tunnel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Managing Costs and Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall manage its operating costs, pricing policies, and other factors with the goal of having revenues derived each fiscal year from providing intercity rail passenger transportation over the Northeast Corridor route between the District of Columbia and Boston, Massachusetts, equal at least the operating costs of providing that transportation in that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Cost Sharing for Nonoperational Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Fifty percent of the cost of improvements under subsection (a)(3) of this section shall be paid by a State, local or regional transportation authority or other responsible party. However, Amtrak may finance entirely a safety-related improvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a part of the cost of improvements under subsection (a)(3) of this section will be paid by a responsible party under paragraph (1) of this subsection, Amtrak may make an agreement with the party under which Amtrak&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall carry out the improvements with amounts appropriated under section 24909 of this title and the party shall reimburse Amtrak; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to the extent provided in an appropriation law, may incur obligations for contracts to carry out the improvements in anticipation of reimbursement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:346 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Amounts reimbursed to Amtrak under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be credited to the appropriation originally charged for the cost of the improvements and are available for further obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Passenger Radio Mobile Telephone Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President and departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government shall assist Amtrak under subsection (a)(6) of this section, subject to the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) and radio services standards, when the Federal Communications Commission decides the assistance is in the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Priorities in Selecting and Scheduling Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When selecting and scheduling specific projects, Amtrak shall apply the following considerations, in the following order of priority:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Safety-related items should be completed before other items because the safety of the passengers and users of the Northeast Corridor is paramount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Activities that benefit the greatest number of passengers should be completed before activities involving fewer passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Reliability of intercity rail passenger transportation must be emphasized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Trip-time requirements of this section must be achieved to the extent compatible with the priorities referred to in paragraphs (1)&ndash;(3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Improvements that will pay for the investment by achieving lower operating or maintenance costs should be carried out before other improvements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Construction operations should be scheduled so that the fewest possible passengers are inconvenienced, transportation is maintained, and the on-time performance of Northeast Corridor commuter rail passenger and rail freight transportation is optimized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Planning should focus on completing activities that will provide immediate benefits to users of the Northeast Corridor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Compatibility With Future Improvements and Production of Maximum Labor Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Improvements under this section shall be compatible with future improvements in transportation and shall produce the maximum labor benefit from hiring individuals presently unemployed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Automatic Train Control Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A train operating on the Northeast Corridor main line or between the main line and Atlantic City shall be equipped with an automatic train control system designed to slow or stop the train in response to an external signal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>High-Speed Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If practicable, Amtrak shall establish intercity rail passenger transportation in the Northeast Corridor that carries out section 703(1)(E) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;210, 90 Stat. 121).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Equipment Development</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall develop economical and reliable equipment compatible with track, operating, and marketing characteristics of the Northeast Corridor, including the capability to meet reliable trip times under section 703(1)(E) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;210, 90 Stat. 121) in regularly scheduled revenue transportation in the Corridor, when the Northeast Corridor improvement program is completed. Amtrak must decide that equipment complies with this subsection before buying equipment with financial assistance of the Government. Amtrak shall submit a request for an authorization of appropriations for production of the equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Agreements for Off-Corridor Routing of Rail Freight Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Amtrak may make an agreement with a rail freight carrier or a regional transportation authority under which the carrier will carry out an alternate off-corridor routing of rail freight transportation over rail lines in the Northeast Corridor between the District of Columbia and New York metropolitan areas, including intermediate points. The agreement shall be for at least 5 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak shall apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of the agreement and all related agreements accompanying the application as soon as the agreement is made. If the Commission finds that approval is necessary to carry out this chapter, the Commission shall approve the application and related agreements not later than 90 days after receiving the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an agreement is not made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, Amtrak, with the consent of the other parties, may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Not later than 90 days after the application, the Commission shall decide on the terms of an agreement if it decides that doing so is necessary to carry out this chapter. The decision of the Commission is binding on the other parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Coordination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall coordinate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) transportation programs related to the Northeast Corridor to ensure that the programs are integrated and consistent with the Northeast Corridor improvement program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) amounts from departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government to achieve urban redevelopment and revitalization in the vicinity of urban rail stations in the Northeast Corridor served by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary finds significant noncompliance with this section, the Secretary may deny financing to a noncomplying program until the noncompliance is corrected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) <cap-smallcap>Completion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall give the highest priority to completing the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Applicable Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No State or local building, zoning, subdivision, or similar or related law, nor any other State or local law from which a project would be exempt if undertaken by the Federal Government or an agency thereof within a Federal enclave wherein Federal jurisdiction is exclusive, including without limitation with respect to all such laws referenced herein above requirements for permits, actions, approvals or filings, shall apply in connection with the construction, ownership, use, operation, financing, leasing, conveying, mortgaging or enforcing a mortgage of (i) any improvement undertaken by or for the benefit of <!-- PDFPage:347 -->Amtrak as part of, or in furtherance of, the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project (including without limitation maintenance, service, inspection or similar facilities acquired, constructed or used for high speed trainsets) or chapter 241, 243, or 247 of this title or (ii) any land (and right, title or interest created with respect thereto) on which such improvement is located and adjoining, surrounding or any related land. These exemptions shall remain in effect and be applicable with respect to such land and improvements for the benefit of any mortgagee before, upon and after coming into possession of such improvements or land, any third party purchasers thereof in foreclosure (or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure), and their respective successors and assigns, in each case to the extent the land or improvements are used, or held for use, for railroad purposes or purposes accessory thereto. This subsection (m) shall not apply to any improvement or related land unless Amtrak receives a Federal operating subsidy in the fiscal year in which Amtrak commits to or initiates such improvement.</p>
