<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) obtain from those carriers, brokers, and persons information the Commission decides is necessary to carry out this subtitle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consistent with the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title, provide administrative assistance to small motor common carriers of passengers and local governments in preparing for proceedings under sections 10922(c)(2),<sup><a href="#10321_1_target" name="10321_1">1</a></sup> 10935, and 11501(e) of this title.</p>

If a witness disobeys a subpena, the Commission, or a party to a proceeding before the Commission, may petition a court of the United States to enforce that subpena.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subpenas may be signed by a Commissioner, the Secretary of the Commission, or a member of a board when the subpena relates to a matter delegated to the board under section 10305 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to enforce a subpena issued under this section. Trial is in the district in which the proceeding is conducted. The court may punish a refusal to obey a subpena as a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In a proceeding, the Commission may take the testimony of a witness by deposition and may order the witness to produce records. A party to a proceeding pending before the Commission may take the testimony of a witness by deposition and may require the witness to produce records at any time after a proceeding is at issue on petition and answer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a witness fails to be deposed or to produce records under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission may subpena the witness to take a deposition, produce the records, or both.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before taking a deposition, reasonable notice must be given in writing by the party or the attorney of that party proposing to take a deposition to the opposing party or the attorney of record of that party, whoever is nearest. The notice shall state the name of the witness and the time and place of taking the deposition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) The testimony of a witness who is in a foreign country may be taken by deposition before an officer or person designated by the Commission or agreed on by the parties by written stipulation filed with the Commission. A deposition shall be filed with the Commission promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Each witness summoned before the Commission or whose deposition is taken under this section and the individual taking the deposition are entitled to the same fees and mileage paid for those services in the courts of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section consolidates and restates the source provisions for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;carry out&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;execute&rdquo; and &ldquo;enforce&rdquo; in 49:12(1)(a) and 304(a)(6) and for &ldquo;administer&rdquo; in 49:304(a)(6), 904(a), and 1003(a) for clarity. In the second sentence, the words &ldquo;foregoing&rdquo; and &ldquo;making of an order&rdquo; from 49:15(16) are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;The Commission may&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The Commission shall have authority, in order to perform the duties and carry out the objects for which it was created&rdquo; and &ldquo;and the Commission shall keep itself informed as to the manner and method in which the same are conducted&rdquo; from 49:12(1)(a) because the authority is discretionary. A similar change has been made for language in 49:304(a) (matter before paragraph (1)), 904(a), and 1003(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c) and (d), the words after the semicolon in 49:305(c) are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the word &ldquo;records&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;books, papers, tariffs, contracts, agreements, and documents&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo;, &ldquo;matter&rdquo;, and &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(1), the word &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;proceeding or investigation&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(3), the words &ldquo;United States magistrate&rdquo; are substituted to conform to title 28. The term &ldquo;district court&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;circuit court&rdquo; because of the Act of March 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(5), the word &ldquo;oath&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;cautioned and sworn (or affirm, if he so request)&rdquo; in view of section 1 of title 1. The words &ldquo;to testify the whole truth, and shall be carefully examined&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
