The words &ldquo;for a total distance of&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;more than&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;line&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;possession of the United States&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;a foreign country&rdquo; and &ldquo;the District of Columbia&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because a carrier crossing the boundary of a foreign country or the District of Columbia into or from the United States would necessarily cross the boundary of a State and be covered by the provision related to a State.</p>
