<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall provide the transportation or service on reasonable request. In addition, a motor common carrier shall provide safe and adequate service, equipment, and facilities. A rail carrier shall not be found to have violated this section because it fulfills its commitments under contracts approved under section 10713 of this title before responding to reasonable requests for service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may prescribe requirements for continuous and adequate transportation and service provided by motor common carriers and household goods freight forwarders subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapters II and IV of chapter 105 of this title and for transportation of baggage and express by such motor common carriers of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may not regulate the duration of, or the amount of compensation payable under, an arrangement between a motor carrier and another party to use, with a driver, a motor vehicle not owned by that carrier to transport property when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the motor vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to be used is that of (i) a farmer or a cooperative association or a federation of cooperative associations under section 10526(a)(4) or (5) of this title, or (ii) a motor private carrier and it is used regularly in the transportation of property referred to in section 10526(a)(6) of this title, or perishable products manufactured from perishable property referred to in that section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is to be used by the carrier in a single movement or in one or more of a series of movements, loaded or empty, in the general direction of the general area where the motor vehicle is based; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:319 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the motor vehicle to be used has completed a movement exempt under section 10526(a)(6) of this title and is next to be used by that carrier in a loaded movement in any direction or in a movement referred to in clause (1)(B) of this subsection, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Resolution of Disputes Relating to Contract or Common Carrier Capacities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a motor carrier (other than a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods) subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title has authority to provide transportation as both a motor common carrier and a motor contract carrier and a dispute arises as to whether certain transportation is provided in its common carrier or contract carrier capacity and the parties are not able to resolve the dispute consensually, the Commission shall have jurisdiction to, and shall, resolve the dispute.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may require terminal facilities, including main-line tracks for a reasonable distance outside of a terminal, owned by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, to be used by another rail carrier if the Commission finds that use to be practicable and in the public interest without substantially impairing the ability of the rail carrier owning the facilities or entitled to use the facilities to handle its own business. The carriers are responsible for establishing the conditions and compensation for use of the facilities. However, if the carriers cannot agree, the Commission may establish conditions and compensation for use of the facilities under the principle controlling compensation in condemnation proceedings. The compensation shall be paid or adequately secured before a carrier may begin to use the facilities of another carrier under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A rail carrier whose terminal facilities are required to be used by another carrier under this section is entitled to recover damages from the other carrier for injuries sustained as the result of compliance with the requirement or for compensation for the use, or both, as appropriate, in a civil action, if it is not satisfied with the conditions for use of the facilities or if the amount of the compensation is not paid promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may require rail carriers to enter into reciprocal switching agreements, where it finds such agreements to be practicable and in the public interest, or where such agreements are necessary to provide competitive rail service. The carriers entering into such an agreement shall establish the conditions and compensation applicable to such agreement, but, if the carriers cannot agree upon such conditions and compensation within a reasonable period of time, the Commission may establish such conditions and compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require reciprocal switching agreements entered into by rail carriers pursuant to this subsection to contain provisions for the protection of the interests of employees affected thereby.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The regulations and paperwork required of motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be minimized to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the protection of individual shippers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Interstate Commerce Commission may issue regulations, including regulations protecting individual shippers, in order to carry out this subtitle with respect to the transportation of household goods by motor common carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations of the Commission protecting individual shippers shall include, where appropriate, reasonable performance standards for the transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title. In establishing performance standards under this paragraph, the Commission shall take into account at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the level of performance that can be achieved by a well-managed motor common carrier transporting household goods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the degree of harm to individual shippers which could result from a violation of the regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the need to set the level of performance at a level sufficient to deter abuses which result in harm to consumers and violations of regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) service requirements of the carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the cost of compliance in relation to the consumer benefits to be achieved from such compliance; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:323 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the need to set the level of performance at a level designed to encourage carriers to offer service responsive to shipper needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Commission's authority to require reports from motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods or to require such carriers to provide specified information to consumers concerning their past performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Every motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title may, upon request of a prospective shipper, provide the shipper with an estimate of charges for transportation of household goods and for the proposed services. The Commission shall not prescribe specific formulas, forms, methods, or techniques for providing a prospective shipper with such an estimate. The Commission shall not prohibit any such carrier from charging a prospective shipper for providing a written, binding estimate for the transportation and proposed services, nor shall the Commission require the final charges to a shipper to be based on an estimate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any charge for an estimate of charges provided by a motor common carrier to a shipper for transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall issue regulations that provide motor carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title with the maximum possible flexibility in weighing shipments, consistent with assurance to the shipper of accurate weighing practices. The Commission shall not prohibit such carriers from backweighing shipments or from basing their charges on the reweigh weights if the shipper observes both the tare and gross weighings (or, prior to such weighings, waives in writing the opportunity to observe such weighings) and such weighings are performed on the same scale.</p>
