<p class="note-body">In clause (1), the words &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; are omitted for consistency and as being unnecessary. The words &ldquo;transportation by motor carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation subject to this chapter&rdquo; and &ldquo;such transportation&rdquo; for clarity and because the jurisdiction of the Commission is stated separately in chapter 105 of the revised title and is unnecessary to be referred to in a definition. The words &ldquo;furnishes, contracts&rdquo; are omitted for consistency and as being surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clauses (2) and (4) are included because a number of the provisions of the subtitle relate to all carriers and all common carriers, respectively, subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and the terms &ldquo;common carriers&rdquo; and &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; provide simple phrases to refer to those carriers.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (3), the words &ldquo;subject to this chapter&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in the definition and because the jurisdiction of the Commission is stated separately in chapter 105 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (5) is included because a number of the provisions of the subtitle relate to motor contract carriers and water contract carriers, and the term &ldquo;contract carrier&rdquo; provides a simple phrase to refer to both of those kinds of carriers.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (6), the words &ldquo;or persons&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall be construed to&rdquo;, &ldquo;or trusts&rdquo;, &ldquo;or companies&rdquo;, and &ldquo;direct or indirect&rdquo; are omitted for consistency and as being surplus. The words &ldquo;reason of the method of or circumstances surrounding organization or operation, through or by&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary as being included in the words &ldquo;power to exercise control&rdquo;.

<p class="note-body">In clauses (7), (16), (17), and (20), the words &ldquo;for compensation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;for hire&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (7), the words &ldquo;natural or artificial&rdquo; are omitted as surplus in view of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in this section and in section 1 of title 1. The words &ldquo;providing express transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engaged in such transportation as aforesaid&rdquo; in view of chapter 105 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (8), the words &ldquo;to transport or&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of the use of the broader phrase &ldquo;provide transportation&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;or any class or classes of property, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in interstate commerce&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement of the various definitions of &ldquo;interstate commerce&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign commerce&rdquo; as grants of jurisdiction to the Commission.
