<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A process by which a rail passenger carrier will maintain and provide to the National Transportation Safety Board, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Homeland Security immediately upon request, a list (which is based on the best available information at the time of the request) of the names of the passengers aboard the train (whether or not such names have been verified), and will periodically update the list. The plan shall include a procedure, with respect to unreserved trains and passengers not holding reservations on other trains, for the rail passenger carrier to use reasonable efforts to ascertain the names of passengers aboard a train involved in an accident.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A process for notifying the families of the passengers, before providing any public notice of the names of the passengers, either by utilizing the services of the organization designated for the accident under section 1139(a)(2) of this title or the services of other suitably trained individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A plan for creating and publicizing a reliable, toll-free telephone number within 4 hours after such an accident occurs, and for providing staff, to handle calls from the families of the passengers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) will be retained by the rail passenger carrier for at least 18 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will be returned to the family unless the possession is needed for the accident investigation or any criminal investigation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) An assurance that the family of each passenger or other person killed in the accident will be consulted about construction by the rail passenger carrier of any monument to the passengers, including any inscription on the monument.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Statutory Construction.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Rail passenger carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting the actions that a rail passenger carrier may take, or the obligations that a rail passenger carrier <!-- PDFPage:502 -->may have, in providing assistance to the families of passengers involved in a rail passenger accident.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Investigational authority of board and secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed to abridge the authority of the Board or the Secretary of Transportation to investigate the causes or circumstances of any rail accident, including the development of information regarding the nature of injuries sustained and the manner in which they were sustained, for the purpose of determining compliance with existing laws and regulations or identifying means of preventing similar injuries in the future.</p>
