<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe a regulation or issue an order restricting the marketability, flexibility, accessibility, or variety of charter air transportation provided under a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title only to the extent required by the public interest. A regulation prescribed or order issued under this subsection may not be more restrictive than a regulation related to charter air transportation that was in effect on October 1, 1978.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:575 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier holding a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title may provide charter air transportation between places in Alaska only to the extent the Secretary decides the transportation is required by public convenience and necessity. The Secretary may make that decision when issuing, amending, or modifying the certificate. This subsection does not apply to a certificate issued under section 41102 to a citizen of the United States who, before July 1, 1977&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintained a principal place of business in Alaska; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conducted air transport operations between places in Alaska with aircraft with a certificate for gross takeoff weight of more than 40,000 pounds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Suspensions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall suspend for not more than 30 days any part of the certificate of a charter air carrier if the Secretary decides that the failure of the carrier to comply with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title, or a regulation or order of the Secretary under section 41110(e) or 41112, requires immediate suspension in the interest of the rights, welfare, or safety of the public. The Secretary may act under this paragraph without notice or a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall begin immediately a hearing to decide if the certificate referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection should be amended, modified, suspended, or revoked. Until the hearing is completed, the Secretary may suspend the certificate for additional periods totaling not more than 60 days. If the Secretary decides that the carrier is complying with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title and regulations and orders under sections 41110(e) and 41112, the Secretary immediately may end the suspension period and proceeding begun under this subsection. However, the Secretary is not prevented from imposing a civil penalty on the carrier for violating the requirements described in section 41110(e) or 41112 or a regulation or order under section 41110(e) or 41112.</p>

In addition, Congress did not intend to maintain the regulation of domestic air transportation of mail. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The word &ldquo;currently&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;opportunity for a&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;or certificates&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of 1:1. The word &ldquo;modify&rdquo; is added for consistency in the revised title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Liability Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may issue a certificate to a citizen of the United States to provide air transportation as an air carrier under section 41102 of this title only if the citizen complies with regulations and orders of the Secretary governing the filing of an insurance policy or self-insurance plan approved by the Secretary. The policy or plan must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the insurance, for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual or for loss of, or damage to, property of others, resulting from the operation or maintenance of the aircraft under the certificate. A certificate does not remain in effect unless the carrier complies with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Financial Responsibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To protect passengers and shippers using an aircraft operated by an air carrier issued a certificate under section 41102 of this title, the Secretary may require the carrier to file a performance bond or equivalent security in the amount and on terms the Secretary prescribes. The bond or security must be sufficient to ensure the carrier adequately will pay the passengers and shippers when the transportation the carrier agrees to provide is not provided. The Secretary shall prescribe the amounts to be paid under this subsection.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Changes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an air carrier or foreign air carrier may change a price or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price or the value of the transportation provided under that price, specified in a tariff of the carrier for foreign air transportation only after 30 days after the carrier has filed, published, and posted notice of the proposed change in the same way as required for a tariff under subsection (a) of this section. However, the Secretary may prescribe an alternative notice requirement, of at least 25 days, to allow an air carrier or foreign air carrier to match a proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier. A notice under this paragraph must state plainly the change proposed and when the change will take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the effect of a proposed change would be to begin a passenger fare that is outside of, or not covered by, the range of passenger fares specified under section 41509(e)(2) and (3) of this title, the proposed change may be put into effect only on the expiration of 60 days after the notice is filed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rejection of Changes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may reject a tariff or tariff change that is not consistent with this section and regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A tariff or change that is rejected is void.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B) provides that 49 App.:1373 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation and 49 App.:1376(a)&ndash;(e), restated in section 41901 of the revised title, governs rates for the transportation of mail by aircraft. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The words &ldquo;passenger fare&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fare&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;for foreign air transportation&rdquo; are added because of 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B). See the revision notes for subsection (a) of this section. The words &ldquo;in the same way as required for a tariff under&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in accordance with&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fares or charges specified in another air carrier's or foreign air carrier's proposed tariff&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;not covered by&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to which such range of fares does not apply&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1482(d)(4) of this Appendix .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. section 1482(d)(7) of this Appendix&rdquo; are omitted because those sections related to interstate and overseas air transportation and the source provisions restated in this section relate to foreign air transportation. In addition, the text of 49 App.:1551(a)(5)(D) provides that 49 App.:1482(d) ceased to be in effect on January 1, 1985, except as related to foreign air transportation. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 1482(j)(9) of this Appendix&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to 49 App.:1482(j)(10) to correct an apparent error in the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 35). Section 24(b) of S. 1300 of the 96th Congress (the derivative source for the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979), as originally passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, restated section 403(c)(2) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 759) to read as it now does with a cross&ndash;reference to section 1002(j)(9) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Also contained in those versions of S. 1300 in section 24(a) was an amendment to section 1002(j) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to add a paragraph (9) that contained language identical to what is now section 1002(j)(10) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. When S. 1300 was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law as the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979, section 24(a) had been changed so that a different paragraph (9) was added and what had been paragraph (9) was now designated as a new paragraph (10) to be added. Apparently, when the conference committee redesignated section 1002(j)(9) as 1002(j)(10) it did not make a corresponding change in the cross&ndash;reference in section 403(c)(2). See 125 Cong. Rec. 26936, 32147, 36939.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;commuter air carrier&rdquo; means an air carrier providing transportation under section 40109(f) of this title that provides at least 5 scheduled roundtrips a week between the same 2 places.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, when the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under section 41508 or 41509 of this title a uniform method generally applicable to establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices for and between air carriers holding certificates issued under section 41102 of this title, the Secretary shall make that uniform method apply to establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices for and between air carriers and commuter air carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required Before Modifying, Suspending, or Ending Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A commuter air carrier that has an agreement with an air carrier to provide transportation for passengers and property that includes through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier's routes and air transportation provided by the air carrier shall give the air carrier and the Secretary at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before modifying, suspending, or ending the transportation. If the commuter air carrier does not give that notice, the uniform method of establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices referred to in subsection (b) of this section does not apply to the commuter air carrier.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1482a(2)(A) is omitted as unnecessary because the definition of &ldquo;air carrier&rdquo; in 49 App.:1301(3) is restated in section 40102(a) of the revised title and applies to this section and because the functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board under 49 App.:1482a were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(E) and the complete name of the Secretary is used the first time the term appears in a section. The text of 49 App.:1482a(3) is omitted as executed. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 416(b)(3) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 [49 App. U.S.C. 1386(b)(3)]&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to section 416(b)(4) to correct an apparent error in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;504, 92 Stat. 1705). Section 24 of H.R. 12611 of the 95th Congress (the derivative source for <!-- PDFPage:596 -->416(b)(4)), added section 416(b)(3) to the Federal Aviation Act. Section 29(c) added provisions that eventually were classified as 49 App.:1482a. Those provisions contained a reference to section 416(b)(3). When S. 2493 (passed in lieu of the House bill after being amended to contain much of the text of the House bill) was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law, section 32 added what had been a new 416(b)(3) as a new 416(b)(4). However, the conference committee did not make a corresponding change in the cross-reference in section 37(c), that added 49 App.:1482a. See 124 Cong. Rec. 30714, 30716, 36521, 36524. The word &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;pursuant to flight schedules&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;pursuant to its authority&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;passengers&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;persons&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words &ldquo;through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier's routes&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation over its routes&rdquo; for clarity.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41509. Authority of the Secretary of Transportation to suspend, cancel, and reject tariffs for foreign air transportation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation and Rejection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on a complaint filed with the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether a price for foreign air transportation contained in an existing or newly filed tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier, a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price, or the value of the transportation provided under that price, is lawful. The Secretary may begin the hearing at once and without an answer or another formal pleading by the air carrier or foreign air carrier, but only after reasonable notice. If, after the hearing, the Secretary decides that the price, classification, rule, or practice is or will be unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory, the Secretary may cancel or reject the tariff and prevent the use of the price, classification, rule, or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With or without a hearing, the Secretary may cancel or reject an existing or newly filed tariff of a foreign air carrier and prevent the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the Secretary decides that the cancellation or rejection is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In deciding whether to cancel or reject a tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the price on the movement of traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient transportation by air carriers and foreign air carriers at the lowest cost consistent with providing the transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the standards prescribed under law related to the character and quality of transportation to be provided by air carriers and foreign air carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inherent advantages of transportation by aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the need of the air carrier and foreign air carrier for revenue sufficient to enable the air carrier and foreign air carrier, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide adequate and efficient air carrier and foreign air carrier transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) whether the price will be predatory or tend to monopolize competition among air carriers and foreign air carriers in foreign air transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) reasonably estimated or foreseeable future costs and revenues for the air carrier or foreign air carrier for a reasonably limited future period during which the price would be in effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) other factors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Suspension</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) Pending a decision under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary may suspend a tariff and the use of a price contained in the tariff or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may suspend a tariff of a foreign air carrier and the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the suspension is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A suspension becomes effective when the Secretary files with the tariff and delivers to the air carrier or foreign air carrier affected by the suspension a written statement of the reasons for the suspension. To suspend a tariff, reasonable notice of the suspension must be given to the affected carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The suspension of a newly filed tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date the tariff otherwise would go into effect. The suspension of an existing tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the effective date of the suspension. The Secretary may rescind at any time the suspension of a newly filed tariff and allow the price, classification, rule, or practice to go into effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effective Tariffs and Prices When Tariff Is Suspended, Canceled, or Rejected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a tariff is suspended pending the outcome of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section and the Secretary does not take final action in the proceeding during the suspension period, the tariff goes into effect at the end of that period subject to cancellation when the proceeding is concluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During the period of suspension, or after the cancellation or rejection, of a newly filed tariff (including a tariff that has gone into effect provisionally), the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier shall maintain in effect and use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the corresponding seasonal prices, or the classifications, rules, and practices affecting those prices or the value of transportation <!-- PDFPage:598 -->provided under those prices, that were in effect for the carrier immediately before the new tariff was filed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) another price provided for under an applicable intergovernmental agreement or understanding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the suspended, canceled, or rejected tariff is the first tariff of the carrier for the covered transportation, the carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an existing tariff is suspended or canceled, the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Response to Refusal of Foreign Country To Allow Air Carrier To Charge a Price</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary finds that the government or an aeronautical authority of a foreign country has refused to allow an air carrier to charge a price contained in a tariff filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary, without a hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may suspend any existing tariff of a foreign air carrier providing transportation between the United States and the foreign country for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date of the suspension; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may order the foreign air carrier to charge, during the suspension periods, prices that are the same as those contained in a tariff (designated by the Secretary) of an air carrier filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a foreign air carrier may continue to provide foreign air transportation to the foreign country only if the government or aeronautical authority of the foreign country allows an air carrier to start or continue foreign air transportation to the foreign country at the prices designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Standard Foreign Fare Level</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In this subsection, &ldquo;standard foreign fare level&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for a class of fares existing on October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places (as adjusted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) filed for and allowed by the Civil Aeronautics Board to go into effect after September 30, 1979, and before August 13, 1980 (with seasonal fares adjusted by the percentage difference that prevailed between seasons in 1978), or the fare established under section 1002(j)(8) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 731), as added by section 24(a) of the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 46); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a class of fares established after October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places in effect on the effective date of the establishment of the new class.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least once every 60 days for fuel costs, and at least once every 180 days for other costs, the Secretary shall adjust the standard foreign fare level for the particular foreign air transportation to which the standard foreign fare level applies by increasing or decreasing that level by the percentage change from the last previous period in the actual operating cost for each available seat-mile. In adjusting a standard foreign fare level, the Secretary may not make an adjustment to costs actually incurred. In establishing a standard foreign fare level and making adjustments in the level under this paragraph, the Secretary may use all relevant or appropriate information reasonably available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not decide that a proposed fare for foreign air transportation is unreasonable on the basis that the fare is too low or too high if the proposed fare is neither more than 5 percent higher nor 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level for the same or essentially similar class of transportation. The Secretary by regulation may increase the 50 percent specified in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply to a proposed fare that is not more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 5 percent higher than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be unreasonably discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is in the public interest because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be predatory or discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is required because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Submission of Orders to President</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall submit to the President an order made under this section suspending, canceling, or rejecting a price for foreign air transportation, and an order rescinding the effectiveness of such an order, before publishing the order. Not later than 10 days after its submission, the President may disapprove the order on finding disapproval is necessary for United States foreign policy or national defense reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Compliance as Condition of Certificate or Permit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section and compliance with an order of the Secretary under this section are conditions to any certificate or permit held by an air carrier or foreign air carrier. An air carrier or foreign air carrier may provide foreign air transportation only as long as the carrier maintains prices for that transportation that comply with this section and orders of the Secretary under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Making Slots Available for Essential Air Service.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Operational authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If basic essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter is to be provided from an eligible point to a high density airport (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), the Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the air carrier providing or selected to provide such service has sufficient operational authority at the high density airport to provide such service. The operational authority shall allow flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of passengers with connecting flights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If necessary to carry out the objectives of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall by order grant exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to air carriers using Stage 3 aircraft or to commuter air carriers, unless such an exemption would significantly increase operational delays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds that an exemption under paragraph (2) would significantly increase operational delays, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that an air carrier providing or selected to provide basic essential air service is able to obtain access to a high density airport; except that the Secretary shall not be required to make slots available at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, if the number of slots available for basic essential air service (including slots specifically designated as essential air service slots and slots used for such purposes) to and from such airport is at least 132 slots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Action by the secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue a final order under this subsection on or before the 60th day after receiving a request from an air carrier for operational authority under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Slots for Foreign Air Transportation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest at a high density airport (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), the Secretary may grant by order exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation using Stage 3 aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Slot withdrawals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not withdraw a slot from an air carrier in order to allocate that slot to a carrier to provide foreign air transportation if the withdrawal of that slot would result in the withdrawal of slots from an air carrier at O'Hare International Airport under section 93.223 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, in excess of the total withdrawn from that air carrier as of October 31, 1993.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:607 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Equivalent rights of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall not take a slot at a high density airport from an air carrier and award such slot to a foreign air carrier if the Secretary determines that air carriers are not provided equivalent rights of access to airports in the country of which such foreign air carrier is a citizen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Period of effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection and exemptions issued under this subsection shall cease to be in effect when the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Slots for New Entrants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest and the circumstances to be exceptional, the Secretary may by order grant exemptions from the requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable new entrant air carriers to provide air transportation at high density airports (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Period of effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Exemptions issued under this subsection shall cease to be in effect on or after the date on which the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Special Rules for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding sections 49104(a)(5) and 49111(e) of this title, or any provision of this section, the Secretary may, only under circumstances determined by the Secretary to be exceptional, grant by order to an air carrier currently holding or operating a slot at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport an exemption from requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), to enable that carrier to provide air transportation with Stage 3 aircraft at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport; except that such exemption shall not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) result in an increase in the total number of slots per day at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) result in an increase in the total number of slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport from 7:00 ante meridiem to 9:59 post meridiem;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increase the number of operations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in any 1-hour period by more than 2 operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) result in the withdrawal or reduction of slots operated by an air carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) result in a net increase in noise impact on surrounding communities resulting from changes in timing of operations permitted under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) continue in effect on or after the date on which the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall adversely affect Exemption No. 5133, as from time-to-time amended and extended.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Study.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Matters to be considered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall continue the Secretary's current examination of slot regulations and shall ensure that the examination includes consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether improvements in technology and procedures of the air traffic control system and the use of quieter aircraft make it possible to eliminate the limitations on hourly operations imposed by the high density rule contained in part 93 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations or to increase the number of operations permitted under such rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the effects of the elimination of limitations or an increase in the number of operations allowed on each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) congestion and delay in any part of the national aviation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the impact of noise on persons living near the airport;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the impact of the current slot allocation process upon the ability of air carriers to provide essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the impact of such allocation process upon the ability of new entrant air carriers to obtain slots in time periods that enable them to provide service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the impact of such allocation process on the ability of foreign air carriers to obtain slots;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the fairness of such process to air carriers and the extent to which air carriers are provided equivalent rights of access to the air transportation market in the countries of which foreign air carriers holding slots are citizens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the impact, on the ability of air carriers to provide domestic and international air service, of the withdrawal of slots from air carriers in order to provide slots for foreign air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the impact of the prohibition on slot withdrawals in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section on the aviation relationship between the United States Government and foreign governments, including whether the prohibition in such subsections will require the withdrawal of slots from general and military aviation in order to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers providing foreign air transportation (and the impact of such withdrawal on general aviation and military aviation) and whether slots will become available to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation as a result of the planned relocation of Air Force Reserve units and the Air National Guard at O'Hare International Airport.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Not Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall decide on the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place for which a decision was not made before October 1, 1988, establishing the level of essential air transportation, when the Secretary receives notice that service to that place will be provided by only one air carrier. The Secretary shall make the decision by the last day of the 6-month period beginning on the date the Secretary receives the notice. The Secretary may impose notice requirements necessary to carry out this subsection. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Until the Secretary has made a decision on a level of basic essential air service for an eligible place under this subsection, the Secretary, on petition by an appropriate representative of the place, shall prohibit an air carrier from ending, suspending, or reducing air transportation to that place that appears to deprive the place of basic essential air service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary decides that basic essential air service will not be provided to an eligible place without compensation, the Secretary shall provide notice that an air carrier may apply to provide basic essential air service to the place for compensation under this section. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the demonstrated reliability of the applicant in providing scheduled air service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contractual and marketing arrangements the applicant has made with a larger carrier to ensure service beyond the hub airport;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the preferences of the actual and potential users of air transportation at the eligible place, giving substantial weight to the views of the elected officials representing the users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for an eligible place in Alaska, the experience of the applicant in providing, in Alaska, scheduled air service, or significant patterns of non-scheduled air service under an exemption granted under section 40109(a) and (c)&ndash;(h) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under guidelines prescribed under section 41737(a) of this title, the Secretary shall pay the rate of compensation for providing basic essential air service under this section and section 41734 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for</cap-smallcap> 30 <cap-smallcap>Days After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an additional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for Additional</cap-smallcap> 30-<cap-smallcap>Day Periods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the 30-day period under subsection (b) of this section the Secretary decides another air carrier will not provide basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing service to continue to provide service for additional 30-day periods until another carrier begins providing service on a continuing basis. At the end of each 30-day period, the Secretary shall decide if another carrier will provide service on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Compensation After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier receiving compensation under section 41733 of this title for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place is required to continue to provide service to the place under this section after the 90-day notice period under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall continue to pay that compensation after the last day of that period. The Secretary shall pay the compensation until the Secretary finds another carrier to provide the service to the place or the 90th day after the end of that notice period, whichever is earlier. If, after the 90th day after the end of the 90-day notice period, the Secretary has not found another carrier to provide the service, the carrier required to continue to provide that service shall receive compensation sufficient&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Compensation to Air Carriers Originally Providing Service Without Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary requires an air carrier providing basic essential air service to an eligible place without compensation under section 41733 of this title to continue providing that service after the 90-day notice period required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide the carrier with compensation after the end of the 90-day notice period that is sufficient&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Finding Replacement Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary requires an air carrier to continue to provide basic essential air service to an eligible place, the Secretary shall continue to make every effort to find another carrier to provide at least that basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier, providing basic essential air service under section 41733 of this title between an eligible place and an airport at which the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration limits the number of instrument flight rule takeoffs and landings of aircraft, provides notice under subsection (a) of this section of an intention to end, suspend, or reduce that service and another carrier is found to provide the service, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to transfer any operational authority the carrier has to land or take off at that airport related to the service to the eligible place to the carrier that will provide the service, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier that will provide the service needs the authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority to be transferred is being used to provide air service to another eligible place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Nonconsideration of Slot Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, the Secretary shall not consider as a factor whether slots at a high density airport are available for providing such service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall review periodically the enhanced essential air service provided to each eligible place under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For service for which the Government pays 50 percent of the compensation, based on the review and consultation with the affected community and the State or local government or person paying the remaining 50 percent of the compensation, the Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments in the type and level of service to the place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For service for which the Government pays 100 percent of the compensation, based on the review and consultation with the State or local government submitting the proposal, the Secretary shall decide whether the service has succeeded for at least a 2-year period under the criteria prescribed under subsection (a)(3) of this section. If unsuccessful, the place is not eligible for air service or air transportation for which compensation is paid by the Secretary under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Ending, Suspending, and Reducing Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of enhanced essential air service established for that place by the Secretary under this section only after giving the Secretary, the affected community, and the State or local government or person paying compensation for that service at least 30 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing the service.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Proposals and Decisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State or local government may propose to the Secretary of Transportation that the Secretary provide compensation to an air carrier to provide air transportation to a place that is not an eligible place under this subchapter. Not later than 90 days after receiving a proposal under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decide whether to designate the place as eligible to receive compensation under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) approve the proposal if the State or local government or a person is willing and able to pay 50 percent of the compensation for providing the transportation, and notify the State or local government of the approval; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) disapprove the proposal if the Secretary decides the proposal is not reasonable under paragraph (2) of this subsection, and notify the State or local government of the disapproval and the reasons for the disapproval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In deciding whether a proposal is reasonable, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the traffic-generating potential of the place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the cost to the United States Government of providing the proposed transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the distance of the place from the closest hub airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval for Certain Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall approve a proposal under this section to compensate an air carrier for providing air transportation to a place in the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia and designate the place as eligible for compensation under this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at any time before October 23, 1978, the place was served by a carrier holding a certificate under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the place is more than 50 miles from the nearest small hub airport or an eligible place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the place is more than 150 miles from the nearest hub airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the State or local government submitting the proposal or a person is willing and able to pay 25 percent of the cost of providing the compensated transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Level of Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary designates a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible for compensation under this section, the Secretary shall decide, not later than 6 months after the date of the designation, on the level of air transportation to be provided under this section. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the place is located, and the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for the transportation under subsection (b)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After making the decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall provide notice that any air carrier that is willing to provide the level of air transportation established under paragraph (1) for a place may submit an application to provide the transportation. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the factors listed in section 41733(c)(1) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the views of the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for the transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section when and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall continue to pay compensation under this section only as long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the air carrier maintains the level of air transportation established by the Secretary under subsection (c)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for transportation under this section continues to pay that compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary decides the compensation is necessary to maintain the transportation to the place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may require the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation under this section to make advance payments or provide other security to ensure that timely payments are made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of air transportation provided under this section. Based on the review and consultation with any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Withdrawal of Eligibility Designations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After providing notice and an opportunity for interested persons to comment, the Secretary may withdraw the designation of a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible to receive compensation under this section if the place has received air transportation under this section for at least 2 years and the Secretary decides the withdrawal would be in the public interest. The Secretary by regulation shall prescribe standards for deciding whether the withdrawal of a designation under this subsection is in the public interest. The standards shall include the factors listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Ending, Suspending, and Reducing Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier providing air <!-- PDFPage:616 -->transportation for compensation under this section may end, suspend, or reduce that transportation below the level of transportation established by the Secretary under this section only after giving the Secretary, the affected community, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section at least 30 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing the transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) include expense elements based on representative costs of air carriers providing scheduled air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on aircraft of the type the Secretary decides is appropriate for providing the service or transportation for which compensation is being provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Promotional amounts described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be a special, segregated element of the compensation provided to a carrier under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may pay compensation to an air carrier for providing air service or air transportation under this subchapter only if the Secretary finds the carrier is able to provide the service or transportation in a reliable way.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) pay or deny the United States Government's share of a claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if denying the claim, notify the carrier of the denial and the reasons for the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Make Agreements and Incur Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may make agreements and incur obligations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund established under section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9502) to pay compensation under this subchapter.

<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;fix and determine&rdquo; and &ldquo;fixing and determining&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) to make clear that the United States Postal Service de<!-- PDFPage:620 -->rives its authority to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate transportation from 39:5402(d) and (f). The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (1st sentence related to non-Alaska interstate and overseas air transportation less words between parentheses) is omitted as superseded by 39:5402(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 5402 of title 39&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (2d, last sentences) is omitted as executed. In clauses (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;prices&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rates of compensation&rdquo; for consistency in this part. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;an opportunity for a hearing on the record&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; for clarity and consistency with subsection (f) of this section.

See the revision notes for subsection (d) of this section. The words &ldquo;out of appropriations for the transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; are omitted as being superseded by chapters 20 and 24 of title 39, United States Code. The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (2d sentence) is omitted as expired because of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence). The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence) is omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;and to make such rates effective from such date as it shall determine to be proper&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted because the power to determine when rates go into effect is included in the power to prescribe rates. The words &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) and (E) provides that transportation of mail in interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska) is transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Postal Service leaving the balance of authority under 49 App.:1376(a) with the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c), (d), and (f), reference to service provided by the Postal Service is omitted as obsolete because of 39:5402(d).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the text of 49 App.:1376(b) (2d sentence words after 2d semicolon, 5th&ndash;7th sentences) and (d) is omitted as obsolete because under 49 App.:1376(c) and 1376a, payments by the Board under 49 App.:1376 were terminated. The text of 49 App.:1376(b) (3d, 4th sentences) is omitted as obsolete because it applies only to rates paid for service performed between October 24, 1978, and January 1, 1983. The text of 49 App.:1376(b) (last sentence) is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(3) and 1553(c) because the date on which the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft expires is set out in 39:5402(f). The source provisions of 49 App.:1551(b)(3) providing for the transfer of that authority from the Secretary to the Postal Service are restated in section 5(k) of this bill.</p>
