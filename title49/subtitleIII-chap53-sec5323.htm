<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of Transportation finds the assistance is essential to a program of projects required under sections 5303&ndash;5306 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary of Transportation finds that the program, to the maximum extent feasible, provides for the participation of private mass transportation companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) just compensation under State or local law will be paid to the company for its franchise or property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Secretary of Labor certifies that the assistance complies with section 5333(b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A governmental authority may not use financial assistance of the United States Government to acquire land, equipment, or a facility used in mass transportation from another governmental authority in the same geographic area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice and Public Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An application for a grant or loan under this chapter (except section 5307) for a capital project that will affect substantially a community, or the mass transportation service of a community, must include a certificate of the applicant that the applicant has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provided an adequate opportunity for a public hearing with adequate prior notice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) held that hearing unless no one with a significant economic, social, or environmental interest requested one;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) considered the economic, social, and environmental effects of the project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) found that the project is consistent with official plans for developing the urban area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notice of a hearing under this subsection shall include a concise description of the proposed project and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the geographic area the project will serve.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Buying and Operating Buses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Financial assistance under this chapter may be used to buy or operate a bus only if the applicant, governmental authority, or publicly owned operator that receives the assistance agrees that, except as provided in the agreement, the governmental authority or an operator of mass transportation for the governmental authority will not provide charter bus transportation service outside the urban area in which it provides regularly scheduled mass transportation service. An agreement shall provide for a fair arrangement the Secretary of Transportation considers appropriate to ensure that the assistance will not enable a governmental authority or an operator for a governmental authority to foreclose a private operator from providing intercity charter bus service if the private operator can provide the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receiving a complaint about a violation of an agreement, the Secretary of Transportation shall investigate and decide whether a violation has occurred. If the Secretary decides that a violation has occurred, the Secretary shall correct the violation under terms of the agreement.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to an applicant that operates a school system in the area to be served and a separate and exclusive schoolbus program for the school system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) unless a private schoolbus operator can provide adequate transportation that complies with applicable safety standards at reasonable rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to a State or local governmental authority if it or a direct predecessor in interest from which it acquired the duty of transporting school children and personnel, and facilities to transport them, provided schoolbus transportation at any time after November 25, 1973, but before November 26, 1974.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Government's Share of Costs for Certain Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A Government grant for a project to be assisted under this chapter that involves acquiring vehicle-related equipment required by the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) is for 90 percent of the net project cost of the equipment that is attributable to complying with those Acts.

<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Buy America</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may obligate an amount that may be appropriated to carry out this chapter for a project only if the steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In this subsection, labor costs involved in final assembly are not included in calculating the cost of components.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Transportation may not make a waiver under paragraph (2) of this subsection for goods produced in a foreign country if the Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, decides that the government of that foreign country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has an agreement with the United States Government under which the Secretary has waived the requirement of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has violated the agreement by discriminating against goods to which this subsection applies that are produced in the United States and to which the agreement applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Not later than January 1, 1995, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit to Congress a report on purchases from foreign entities waived under paragraph (2) of this subsection in the fiscal years ending September 30, 1992, and September 30, 1993. The report shall indicate the dollar value of items for which waivers were granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Application of Section</cap-smallcap> 135 <cap-smallcap>of Title</cap-smallcap> 23.&mdash;The planning and programming requirements of section 135 of title 23 apply to a grant made under sections 5307&ndash;5311 of this title.</p>
