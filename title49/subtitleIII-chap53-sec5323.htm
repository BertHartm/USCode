<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of Transportation finds the assistance is essential to a program of projects required under sections 5303&ndash;5306 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary of Transportation finds that the program, to the maximum extent feasible, provides for the participation of private mass transportation companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) just compensation under State or local law will be paid to the company for its franchise or property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Secretary of Labor certifies that the assistance complies with section 5333(b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A governmental authority may not use financial assistance of the United States Government to acquire land, equipment, or a facility used in mass transportation from another governmental authority in the same geographic area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provided an adequate opportunity for a public hearing with adequate prior notice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) held that hearing unless no one with a significant economic, social, or environmental interest requested one;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Acquiring New Bus Models</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts appropriated or made available under this chapter after September 30, 1989, may be obligated or expended to acquire a new bus model only if a bus of the model has been tested at the facility established under section 5318 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Condition on Charter Bus Transportation Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Financial assistance under this chapter may be used to buy or operate a bus only if the applicant, governmental authority, or publicly owned operator that receives the assistance agrees that, except as provided in the agreement, the governmental authority or an operator of mass transportation for the governmental authority will not provide charter bus transportation service outside the urban area in which it provides regularly scheduled mass transportation service. An agreement shall provide for a fair arrangement the Secretary of Transportation considers appropriate to ensure that the assistance will not enable a governmental authority or an operator for a governmental authority to foreclose a private operator from providing intercity charter bus service if the private operator can provide the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receiving a complaint about a violation of an agreement, the Secretary of Transportation shall investigate and decide whether a violation has occurred. If the Secretary decides that a violation has occurred, the Secretary shall correct the violation under terms of the agreement.

This subsection does not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to an applicant that operates a school system in the area to be served and a separate and exclusive schoolbus program for the school system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) unless a private schoolbus operator can provide adequate transportation that complies with applicable safety standards at reasonable rates; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) pay ordinary governmental or nonproject operating expenses; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) support a procurement that uses an exclusionary or discriminatory specification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Government Share of Costs for Certain Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A grant for a project to be assisted under this chapter that involves acquiring vehicle-related equipment required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) or vehicle-related equipment (including clean fuel or alternative fuel vehicle-related equipment) for purposes of complying with or maintaining compliance with the Clean Air Act, is for 90 percent of the net project cost of such equipment attributable to compliance with those Acts.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) final assembly of the rolling stock has occurred in the United States; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) including domestic material will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In this subsection, labor costs involved in final assembly are not included in calculating the cost of components.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Transportation may not make a waiver under paragraph (2) of this subsection for goods produced in a foreign country if the Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, decides that the government of that foreign country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has an agreement with the United States Government under which the Secretary has waived the requirement of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has violated the agreement by discriminating against goods to which this subsection applies that are produced in the United States and to which the agreement applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A person is ineligible under subpart 9.4 of chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, to receive a contract or subcontract made with amounts authorized under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 1914) if a court or department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government decides the person intentionally&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Opportunity to correct inadvertent error</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may allow a manufacturer or supplier of steel, iron, or manufactured goods to correct after bid opening any certification of noncompliance or failure to properly <!-- PDFPage:161 -->complete the certification (but not including failure to sign the certification) under this subsection if such manufacturer or supplier attests under penalty of perjury that such manufacturer or supplier submitted an incorrect certification as a result of an inadvertent or clerical error. The burden of establishing inadvertent or clerical error is on the manufacturer or supplier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Participation of Governmental Agencies in Design and Delivery of Transportation Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent feasible, governmental agencies and nonprofit organizations that receive assistance from Government sources (other than the Department of Transportation) for nonemergency transportation services&mdash;</p>
