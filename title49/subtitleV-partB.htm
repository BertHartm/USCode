<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall provide financial assistance to a State, as provided under this chapter, for a rail freight assistance project of the State when a rail carrier subject to part A of subtitle IV of this title maintains a rail line in the State. The assistance is for the cost of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) acquiring, in any way the State considers appropriate, an interest in a rail line or rail property to maintain existing, or to provide future, rail freight transportation, but only if the Surface Transportation Board has authorized, or exempted from the requirements of that authorization, the abandonment of, or the discontinuance of rail transportation on, the rail line related to the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improving and rehabilitating rail property on a rail line to the extent necessary to allow adequate and efficient rail freight transportation on the line, but only if the rail carrier certifies that the rail line related to the project carried not more than 5,000,000 gross ton-miles of freight a mile in the prior year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) building rail or rail-related facilities (including new connections between at least 2 existing rail lines, intermodal freight terminals, sidings, bridges, and relocation of existing lines) to improve the quality and efficiency of the rail freight transportation, but only if the rail carrier certifies that the rail line related to the project carried not more than 5,000,000 gross ton-miles of freight a mile in the prior year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Calculating Cost-Benefit Ratio</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish a methodology for calculating the ratio of benefits to costs of projects proposed under this chapter. In establishing the methodology, the Secretary shall consider the need for equitable treatment of different regions of the United States and different commodities transported by rail. The establishment of the methodology is committed to the discretion of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Assistance for a project shall be provided under this chapter only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a rail carrier certifies that the rail line related to the project carried more than 20 carloads a mile during the most recent year during which transportation was provided by the carrier on the line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the ratio of benefits to costs for the project, as calculated using the methodology established under subsection (b) of this section, is more than 1.0.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the rail carrier that provided the transportation on the rail line is no longer in existence, the applicant for the project shall provide the information required by the certification under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection in the way the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) or (2) of this subsection if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decides that the rail line has contractual guarantees of at least 40 carloads a mile for each of the first 2 years of operation of the proposed project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finds that there is a reasonable expectation that the contractual guarantees will be fulfilled.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may not receive more than 15 percent of the amounts provided in a fiscal year under this chapter. Not more than 20 percent of the amounts available under this chapter may be provided in a fiscal year for any one project.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of Program.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall establish a program for making capital grants to class II and class III railroads. Such grants shall be for projects in the public interest that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) rehabilitate, preserve, or improve railroad track (including roadbed, bridges, and related track structures) used primarily for freight transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) facilitate the continued or greater use of railroad transportation for freight shipments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) reduce the use of less fuel efficient modes of transportation in the transportation of such shipments; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) demonstrate innovative technologies and advanced research and development that increase fuel economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lower the costs of operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Provision of grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Grants may be provided under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) directly to the class II or class III railroad; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with the concurrence of the class II or class III railroad, to a State or local government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>State cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Class II and class III railroad applicants for a grant under this chapter are encouraged to utilize the expertise and assistance of State transportation agencies in applying for and administering such grants. State transportation agencies are encouraged to provide such expertise and assistance to such railroads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than October 1, 2008, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to implement the program under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Federal Share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The maximum Federal share for carrying out a project under this section shall be 80 percent of the project cost. The non-Federal share may be provided by any non-Federal source in cash, equipment, or supplies. Other in-kind contributions may be approved by the Secretary on a case-by-case basis consistent with this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Use of Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Grants provided under this section shall be used to implement track capital projects as soon as possible. In no event shall grant funds be contractually obligated for a project later than the end of the third Federal fiscal year following the year in which the grant was awarded. Any funds not so obligated by the end of such fiscal year shall be returned to the Secretary for reallocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Employee Protection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require as a condition of any grant made under this section that the recipient railroad provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees who are affected by the project to be funded with the grant as the terms imposed under section 11326(a), as in effect on the date of the enactment of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Labor Standards.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Prevailing wages</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall ensure that laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors in construction work financed by a grant made under this section will be paid wages not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor under subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Davis-Bacon Act&rdquo;). The Secretary shall make a grant under this section only after being assured that required labor standards will be maintained on the construction work.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:460 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Wage rates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Wage rates in a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) are deemed for purposes of this subsection to comply with the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#22301_1_target" name="22301_1">1</a></sup> subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall conduct a study of the projects carried out with grant assistance under this section to determine the extent to which the program helps promote a reduction in fuel use associated with the transportation of freight and demonstrates innovative technologies that increase fuel economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lower the costs of operation. Not later than March 31, 2009, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the study, including any recommendations the Secretary considers appropriate regarding the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2011 for carrying out this section.</p>
