<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Ordering Restrictions and Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, through testing, inspection, investigation, or research carried out under this chapter, the Secretary of Transportation decides that an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, causes an emergency situation involving a hazard of death, personal injury, or significant harm to the environment, the Secretary immediately may order restrictions and prohibitions, without regard to section 20103(e) of this title, that may be necessary to abate the situation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The order shall describe the condition or practice, or a combination of conditions and practices, that causes the emergency situation and prescribe standards and procedures for obtaining relief from the order. This paragraph does not affect the Secretary's discretion under this section to maintain the order in effect for as long as the emergency situation exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After issuing an order under this section, the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for review of the order under section 554 of title 5. If a petition for review is filed and the review is not completed by the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the order was issued, the order stops being effective at the end of that period unless the Secretary decides in writing that the emergency situation still exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Compel Issuance of Orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An employee of a railroad carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce who may be exposed to imminent physical injury during that employment because of the Secretary's failure, without any reasonable basis, to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section, or the employee's authorized representative, may bring a civil action against the Secretary in a district court of the United States to compel the Secretary to issue an order. The action must be brought in the judicial district in which the emergency situation is alleged to exist, in which that employing carrier has its principal executive office, or for the District of Columbia. The Secretary's failure to issue an order under subsection (a) of this section may be reviewed only under section 706 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Investigative and Surveillance Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary concerned may prescribe investigative and surveillance activities necessary to enforce the safety regulations prescribed and orders issued by the Secretary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#20105_1_target" name="20105_1">1</a></sup> that apply to railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in a State. The State may participate in those activities when the safety practices for railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in the State are regulated by a State authority and the authority submits to the Secretary concerned an annual certification as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Annual Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State authority's annual certification must include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a certification that the authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has regulatory jurisdiction over the safety practices for railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) was given a copy of each safety regulation prescribed and order issued by the Secretary concerned, that applies to the equipment, facilities, rolling stock, or operations, as of the date of certification; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the record maintenance, reporting, and inspection practices conducted by the <!-- PDFPage:406 -->authority to aid the Secretary concerned in enforcing railroad safety regulations prescribed and orders issued by the Secretary concerned, including the number of inspections made of railroad equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations by the authority during the prior 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) other information the Secretary concerned requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annual certification applies to a safety regulation prescribed or order issued after the date of the certification only if the State authority submits an appropriate certification to provide the necessary investigative and surveillance activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, after receipt of an annual certification, the Secretary concerned decides the State authority is not complying satisfactorily with the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary concerned may reject any part of the certification or take other appropriate action to achieve adequate enforcement.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may terminate any part of an agreement made under this subsection on finding that the authority has not provided every part of the investigative and surveillance activities to which the agreement relates. The Secretary concerned must give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before making such a finding. The finding and termination shall be published in the Federal Register and may not become effective for at least 15 days after the date of publication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Agreement for Investigative and Surveillance Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to providing for State participation under this section, the Secretary concerned may make an agreement with a State to provide investigative and surveillance activities related to the duties under chapters 203&ndash;213 of this title (in the case of the Secretary of Transportation) and duties under section 114 of this title (in the case of the Secretary of Homeland Security).</p>

However, the Secretary concerned may pay an authority only when the authority assures the Secretary concerned that it will provide the remaining cost of the safety program and that the total State money expended for the safety program, excluding grants of the United States Government, will be at least as much as the average amount expended for the fiscal years that ended June 30, 1969, and June 30, 1970.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary concerned may monitor State investigative and surveillance practices and carry out other inspections and investigations necessary to help enforce this chapter (in the case of the Secretary of Transportation) and duties under section 114 of this title (in the case of the Secretary of Homeland Security).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;At the request of the Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;at the request of the Secretary&rdquo; in 45:439(a), and are made applicable to all of the source provisions restated in this subsection, for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;at the request of the Secretary&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are interpreted and restated to mean that the Secretary's request is to the Attorney General rather than to the district court. See H.R. Rept. No. 91&ndash;1194, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20 (1970). The words &ldquo;the Attorney General may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such district court shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (last sentence), &ldquo;The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, upon petition by the Attorney General&rdquo; in 45:437(d)(2), and &ldquo;The United States district court shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon petition by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have jurisdiction&rdquo; in 45:439(a) for clarity and consistency. It is not necessary to restate that the district court has jurisdiction because of 28:1331 and 1345. See also the statement of Senator Prouty in 115 Cong. Rec. 40205 (1969) explaining that similar language in section 110 of S. 1933, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (the derivative source for 45:439) would grant the Attorney General the power to seek injunctions. Clauses (1)&ndash;(3) are substituted for the source provisions to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of rules 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&rdquo; in 45:439(a) are omitted as surplus because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.) apply in the district court unless otherwise provided. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;or an amount agreed on in compromise&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the text of 45:439(c) (words before 1st comma) is omitted because it applies only to actions brought by a State authority. See discussion of the cross-reference in the note for section 20113(c) of the revised title. The last sentence is substituted for &ldquo;in which the individual resides&rdquo; in 45:438(c) because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;compliance order issued under section 20111(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;order, or directive&rdquo; because the latter words are interpreted as referring to &ldquo;orders directing compliance&rdquo; in 45:437(a) (2d sentence), restated in section 20111(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen be subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of the tested individual and that a part of the specimen be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that if the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained part tested by a 2d confirmation test done independently at another certified laboratory if the individual requests the 2d confirmation test not later than 3 days after being advised of the results of the first confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations that may be necessary and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>

The Secretary shall decide on the circumstances under which employees shall be required to participate in a program. Each railroad carrier is encouraged to make such a program available to all of its employees in addition to employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Interim Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than December 31, 1992, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe temporary regulations identifying ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights as temporary locomotive visibility measures and authorizing and encouraging the installation and use of those lights. Subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 does not apply to a temporary regulation or to an amendment to a temporary regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Review of Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review the Secretary's regulations on locomotive visibility. Not later than December 31, 1993, the Secretary shall complete the current research of the Department of Transportation on locomotive visibility. In conducting the review, the Secretary shall collect relevant information from operational experience by rail carriers using enhanced visibility measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Regulatory Proceeding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than June 30, 1994, the Secretary shall begin a regulatory proceeding to prescribe final regulations requiring substantially enhanced locomotive visibility measures. In the proceeding, the Secretary shall consider at least&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) revisions to the existing locomotive headlight standards, including standards for placement and intensity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring the use of reflective material to enhance locomotive visibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requiring the use of additional alerting lights, including ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) requiring the use of auxiliary lights to enhance locomotive visibility when viewed from the side;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the effect of an enhanced visibility measure on the vision, health, and safety of train crew members; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) separate standards for self-propelled, push-pull, and multi-unit passenger operations without a dedicated head end locomotive.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Final Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than June 30, 1995, the Secretary shall prescribe final regulations requiring enhanced locomotive visibility measures. The Secretary shall require that not later than December 31, 1997, a locomotive not excluded from the regulations be equipped with temporary visibility measures under subsection (b) of this section or the visibility measures the final regulations require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing regulations under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may exclude a category of trains or rail operations from a specific visibility requirement if the Secretary decides the exclusion is in the public interest and is consistent with rail safety, including grade-crossing safety.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;highway-rail grade crossing&rdquo; includes any street or highway crossing over a line of railroad at grade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;locomotive horn&rdquo; refers to a train-borne audible warning device meeting standards specified by the Secretary of Transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;supplementary safety measure&rdquo; refers to a safety system or procedure, provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the highway-rail grade crossing, that is determined by the Secretary to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties. A traffic control arrangement that prevents careless movement over the crossing (e.g., as where adequate median barriers prevent movement around crossing gates extending over the full width of the lanes in the particular direction of travel), and that conforms to standards prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection, shall be deemed to constitute a supplementary safety measure. The following do not, individually or in combination, constitute supplementary safety measures within the meaning of this subsection: standard traffic control devices or arrangements such as reflectorized crossbucks, stop signs, flashing lights, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of railroad, or traffic signals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations requiring that a locomotive horn shall be sounded while each train is approaching and entering upon each public highway-rail grade crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In issuing such regulations, the Secretary may except from the requirement to sound the locomotive horn any categories of rail operations or categories of highway-rail grade crossings (by train speed or other factors specified by regulation)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the Secretary determines not to present a significant risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for which use of the locomotive horn as a warning measure is impractical; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:429 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for which, in the judgment of the Secretary, supplementary safety measures fully compensate for the absence of the warning provided by the locomotive horn.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to provide for safety and the quiet of communities affected by train operations, the Secretary may specify in such regulations that any supplementary safety measures must be applied to all highway-rail grade crossings within a specified distance along the railroad in order to be excepted from the requirement of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application for Waiver or Exemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may not entertain an application for waiver or exemption of the regulations issued under this section unless such application shall have been submitted jointly by the railroad carrier owning, or controlling operations over, the crossing and by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority. The Secretary shall not grant any such application unless, in the judgment of the Secretary, the application demonstrates that the safety of highway users will not be diminished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Development of Supplementary Safety Measures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In order to promote the quiet of communities affected by rail operations and the development of innovative safety measures at highway-rail grade crossings, the Secretary may, in connection with demonstration of proposed new supplementary safety measures, order railroad carriers operating over one or more crossings to cease temporarily the sounding of locomotive horns at such crossings.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;20161. Fostering introduction of new technology to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Collisions between highway users and trains at highway-rail grade crossings continue to cause an unacceptable loss of life, serious personal injury, and property damage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) While elimination of at-grade crossings through consolidation of crossings and grade separations offers the greatest long-term promise for optimizing the safety and efficiency of the two modes of transportation, over 140,000 public grade crossings remain on the general rail system&mdash;approximately one for each route mile on the general rail system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Conventional highway traffic control devices such as flashing lights and gates are often effective in warning motorists of a train's approach to an equipped crossing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Since enactment of the Highway Safety Act of 1973, over $4,200,000,000 of Federal funding has been invested in safety improvements at highway-rail grade crossings, yet a majority of public highway-rail grade crossings are not yet equipped with active warning systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The emergence of new technologies presents opportunities for more effective and affordable warnings and safer passage of highway users and trains at remaining highway-rail grade crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Implementation of new crossing safety technology will require extensive cooperation between highway authorities and railroad carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal Railroad Administration regulations establishing performance standards for processor-based signal and train control systems provide a suitable framework for qualification of new or novel technology at highway-rail grade crossings, and the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides an appropriate means of determining highway user interface with such new technology.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States to encourage the development of new technology that can prevent loss of life and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary of Transportation is designated to carry out this policy in consultation with States and necessary public and private entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Submission of New Technology Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Railroad carriers and railroad suppliers may submit for review and approval to the Secretary such new technology designed to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary shall approve by order the new technology designed to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings in accordance with Federal Railroad Administration standards for the development and use of processor-based signal and train control systems and shall consider the effects on safety of highway-user interface with the new technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Secretarial Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary approves by order new technology to provide warning to highway users at a highway-rail grade crossing and such technology is installed at a highway-rail grade crossing in accordance with the conditions of the approval, this determination preempts any State statute or regulation concerning the adequacy of the technology in providing warning at the crossing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Installation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When the Secretary of Transportation decides after an investigation that it is necessary in the public interest, the Secretary may order a railroad carrier to install, on any part of its railroad line, a signal system that complies with requirements of the Secretary. The order must allow the carrier a reasonable time to complete the installation. A carrier may discontinue or materially alter a signal system required under this paragraph only with the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A railroad carrier ordered under paragraph (1) of this subsection to install a signal system on one part of its railroad line may not be held negligent for not installing the system on any part of its line that was not included in the order. If an accident or incident occurs on a part of the line on which the signal system was not required to be installed and was not installed, the use of the system on another part of the line may not be considered in a civil action brought because of the accident or incident.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A railroad carrier may allow a signal system to be used on its railroad line only when the system, including its controlling and operating appurtenances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may be operated safely without unnecessary risk of personal injury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has been inspected and can meet any test prescribed under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inspect every locomotive and tender and its parts and appurtenances as necessary to carry out this chapter, but not necessarily at stated times or at regular intervals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that every railroad carrier makes inspections of locomotives and tenders and their parts and appurtenances as required by regulations prescribed by the Secretary and repairs every defect that is disclosed by an inspection before a defective locomotive, tender, part, or appurtenance is used again.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Noncomplying Locomotives, Tenders, and Parts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When the Secretary finds that a locomotive, tender, or locomotive or tender part or appurtenance owned or operated by a railroad carrier does not comply with this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter, the Secretary shall give the carrier written notice describing any defect resulting in noncompliance. Not later than 5 days after receiving the notice of noncompliance, the carrier may submit a written request for a reinspection. On receiving the request, the Secretary shall provide for the reinspection by an officer or employee of the Department of Transportation who did not make the original inspection. The reinspection shall be made not later than 15 days after the date the Secretary gives the notice of noncompliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Immediately after the reinspection is completed, the Secretary shall give written notice to the railroad carrier stating whether the locomotive, tender, part, or appurtenance is in compliance. If the original finding of noncompliance is sustained, the carrier has 30 days after receipt of the notice to file an appeal with the Secretary. If the carrier files an appeal, the Secretary, after providing an opportunity for a proceeding, may revise or set aside the finding of noncompliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A locomotive, tender, part, or appurtenance found not in compliance under this subsection may be used only after it is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) repaired to comply with this chapter and regulations prescribed under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) found on reinspection or appeal to be in compliance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inspection made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) repair made of a defect disclosed by such an inspection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) An interim period available for less than 4 hours rest at a designated terminal is time on duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) An interim period available for at least 4 hours rest at a place with suitable facilities for food and lodging is not time on duty when the employee is prevented from getting to the employee's designated terminal by any of the following:</p>

In this subsection, an emergency ends when the track is cleared and the railroad line is open for traffic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Communication During Time Off Duty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During a train employee's minimum off-duty period of 10 consecutive hours, as provided under subsection (a) or during an interim period of at least 4 consecutive hours available for rest under subsection (b)(7) or during additional off-duty hours under subsection (c)(4), a railroad carrier, and its officers and agents, shall not communicate with the train employee by telephone, by pager, or in any other manner that could reasonably be expected to disrupt the employee's rest. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit communication necessary to notify an employee of an emergency situation, as defined by the Secretary. The Secretary may waive the <!-- PDFPage:450 -->requirements of this paragraph for commuter or intercity passenger railroads if the Secretary determines that such a waiver will not reduce safety and is necessary to maintain such railroads&rsquo; efficient operations and on-time performance of its trains.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a railroad carrier and its officers and agents may not require or allow its signal employees to remain or go on duty and a contractor or subcontractor to a railroad carrier and its officers and agents may not require or allow its signal employees to remain or go on duty&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unless that employee has had at least 10 consecutive hours off duty during the prior 24 hours.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determining Time on Duty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining under subsection (a) of this section the time a signal employee is on duty or off duty, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Time on duty begins when the employee reports for duty and ends when the employee is finally released from duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Time spent performing any other service for the railroad carrier during a 24-hour period in which the employee is engaged in installing, repairing, or maintaining signal systems is time on duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Time spent returning from a trouble call, whether the employee goes directly to the employee's residence or by way of the employee's headquarters, is neither time on duty nor time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If, at the end of scheduled duty hours, an employee has not completed the trip from the final outlying worksite of the duty period to the employee's headquarters or directly to the employee's residence, the time after the scheduled duty hours necessarily spent in completing the trip to the residence or headquarters is neither time on duty nor time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If an employee is released from duty at an outlying worksite before the end of the employee's scheduled duty hours to comply with this section, the time necessary for the trip from the worksite to the employee's headquarters or directly to the employee's residence is neither time on duty nor time off duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Time spent in transportation on an ontrack vehicle, including time referred to in paragraphs (3)&ndash;(5) of this subsection, is time on duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A regularly scheduled meal period or another release period of at least 30 minutes but not more than one hour is time off duty and does not break the continuity of service of the employee under this section, but a release pe<!-- PDFPage:451 -->riod of more than one hour is time off duty and does break the continuity of service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Emergencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A signal employee may be allowed to remain or go on duty for not more than 4 additional hours in any period of 24 consecutive hours when an emergency exists and the work of that employee is related to the emergency. In this subsection, an emergency ends when the signal system is restored to service. A signal employee may not be allowed to remain or go on duty under the emergency authority provided under this subsection to conduct routine repairs, routine maintenance, or routine inspection of signal systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Communication During Time Off Duty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During a signal employee's minimum off-duty period of 10 consecutive hours, as provided under subsection (a), a railroad carrier or a contractor or subcontractor to a railroad carrier, and its officers and agents, shall not communicate with the signal employee by telephone, by pager, or in any other manner that could reasonably be expected to disrupt the employee's rest. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit communication necessary to notify an employee of an emergency situation, as defined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exclusivity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The hours of service, duty hours, and rest periods of signal employees shall be governed exclusively by this chapter.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to improve safety and reduce employee fatigue, the Secretary may prescribe regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to reduce the maximum hours an employee may be required or allowed to go or remain on duty to a level less than the level established under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to increase the minimum hours an employee may be required or allowed to rest to a level greater than the level established under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to limit or eliminate the amount of time an employee spends waiting for deadhead transportation or in deadhead transportation from a duty assignment to the place of final release that is considered neither on duty nor off duty under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for signal employees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to limit or eliminate the amount of time that is considered to be neither on duty nor off duty under this chapter that an employee spends returning from an outlying worksite after scheduled duty hours or returning from a trouble call to the employee's headquarters or directly to the employee's residence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to increase the amount of time that constitutes a release period, that does not break the continuity of service and is considered time off duty; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to require other changes to railroad operating and scheduling practices, including unscheduled duty calls, that could affect employee fatigue and railroad safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Regulations Governing the Hours of Service of Train Employees of Commuter and Intercity Passenger Railroad Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 3 years after the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations and issue orders to establish hours of service requirements for train employees engaged in commuter rail passenger transportation and intercity rail passenger transportation (as defined in section 24102 of this title) that may differ from the requirements of this chapter. Such regulations and orders may address railroad operating and scheduling practices, including unscheduled duty calls, communications during time off duty, and time spent waiting for deadhead transportation or in deadhead transportation from a <!-- PDFPage:454 -->duty assignment to the place of final release, that could affect employee fatigue and railroad safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In issuing regulations under subsection (a) the Secretary shall consider scientific and medical research related to fatigue and fatigue abatement, railroad scheduling and operating practices that improve safety or reduce employee fatigue, a railroad's use of new or novel technology intended to reduce or eliminate human error, the variations in freight and passenger railroad scheduling practices and operating conditions, the variations in duties and operating conditions for employees subject to this chapter, a railroad's required or voluntary use of fatigue management plans covering employees subject to this chapter, and any other relevant factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Time Limits.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the Secretary determines that regulations are necessary under subsection (a), the Secretary shall first request that the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee develop proposed regulations and, if the Committee accepts the task, provide the Committee with a reasonable time period in which to complete the task.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the Secretary requests that the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee accept the task of developing regulations under subsection (b) and the Committee accepts the task, the Committee shall reach consensus on the rulemaking within 18 months after accepting the task. If the Committee does not reach consensus within 18 months after the Secretary makes the request, the Secretary shall prescribe appropriate regulations within 18 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If the Secretary does not request that the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee accept the task of developing regulations under subsection (b), the Secretary shall prescribe regulations within 3 years after the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Pilot Projects.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Secretary shall conduct at least 2 pilot projects of sufficient size and scope to analyze specific practices which may be used to reduce fatigue for train and engine and other railroad employees as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A pilot project at a railroad or railroad facility to evaluate the efficacy of communicating to employees notice of their assigned shift time 10 hours prior to the beginning of their assigned shift as a method for reducing employee fatigue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A pilot project at a railroad or railroad facility to evaluate the efficacy of requiring railroads who use employee scheduling practices that subject employees to periods of unscheduled duty calls to assign employees to defined or specific unscheduled call shifts that are followed by shifts not subject to call, as a method for reducing employee fatigue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may temporarily waive the requirements of this section, if necessary, to complete a pilot project under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Duty Call Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section the term &ldquo;duty call&rdquo; means a telephone call that a railroad places to an employee to notify the employee of his or her assigned shift time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may not fail to comply with section 20160 or with a regulation prescribed or order issued by the Secretary of Transportation under chapter 201 of this title. Subject to section 21304 of this title, a person violating section 20160 of this title or a regulation prescribed or order issued by the Secretary under chapter 201 is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty. The Secretary shall impose the penalty applicable under paragraph (2) of this subsection. A separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall include in, or make applicable to, each regulation prescribed and order issued under chapter 201 of this title a civil penalty for a violation. The Secretary shall impose a civil penalty for a violation of section 20160 of this title. The amount of the penalty shall be at least $500 but not more than $25,000. However, when a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has caused an imminent hazard of death or injury to individuals, or has caused death or injury, the amount may be not more than $100,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may compromise the amount of a civil penalty imposed under this subsection to not less than $500 before referring the matter to the Attorney General for collection. In determining the amount of a compromise, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of violations, the ability to pay, and any effect on the ability to continue to do business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) other matters that justice requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Setoff</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government may deduct the amount of a civil penalty imposed or com<!-- PDFPage:455 -->promised under this section from amounts it owes the person liable for the penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Deposit in Treasury</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil penalty collected under this section or section 20113(b) of this title shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;impose&rdquo; and &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;assessed&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the first 2 sentences are substituted for 45:438(a) and (c) (1st sentence) for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;(including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 1:1 and because the provision being violated indicates to whom it applies. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in 45:438(c) (1st sentence) is retained from the source provisions. For a discussion of whether the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to impose a penalty is mandatory or permissive, see <em>Railway Labor Executives&rsquo; Ass'n</em> v. <em>Dole</em>, 760 F.2d 1021, 1024, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985); H.R. Conf. Rept. No. 100&ndash;637, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20; 134 Cong. Rec. H3470, May 23, 1988 (daily ed.); 134 Cong. Rec. S7510, June 9, 1988 (daily ed.). See also 134 Cong. Rec. E1946, June 10, 1988 (daily ed.). For an extended discussion of FRA's prosecutorial discretion, see <em>Nationwide Rail Safety: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Transportation, Tourism, and Hazardous Materials of the House Energy and Commerce Committee</em>, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 54&ndash;65 (1987). See also section 6 of this bill that provides that this bill restates, without substantive change, the provisions of law replaced by this bill, and that this bill may not be construed as making a substantive change in the law restated. Therefore, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this subsection has the same meaning it has under existing law. The words &ldquo;A separate violation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a separate offense&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;may compromise the amount .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to not less than $500&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may, however, be compromised .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for any amount, but in no event for an amount less than the minimum provided in subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (B), the words &ldquo;prior or subsequent&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;deposited in&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;covered into&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to section 21304 of this title, a person violating chapter 211 of this title, including section 21103 (as such section was in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008), or violating any provision of a waiver applicable to that person that has been granted under section 21108 of this title, is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty. An act by an individual that causes a railroad carrier to be in violation is a violation. For a violation of section 21106 of this title, a separate violation occurs for each day a facility is not in compliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation imposes a civil penalty under this subsection. The amount of the penalty shall be at least $500 but not more than $25,000. However, when a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has caused an imminent hazard of death or injury to individuals, or has caused death or injury, the amount may be not more than $100,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may compromise the amount of the civil penalty under section 3711 of title 31. In determining the amount of a compromise, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of violations, the ability to pay, and any effect on the ability to continue to do business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) other matters that justice requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary does not compromise the amount of the civil penalty, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General for collection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Collect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Attorney General shall bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to collect a civil penalty that is referred to the Attorney General for collection under subsection (a) of this section after satisfactory information is presented to the Attorney General. The action may be brought in the judicial district in which the violation occurred or the defendant has its principal executive office. If the action is against an individual, the action also may be brought in the judicial district in which the individual resides.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A civil action under this subsection must be brought not later than 2 years after the date of the violation unless administrative notification under section 3711 of title 31 is given within that 2-year period to the person committing the violation. However, even if notification is given, the action must be brought within the period specified in section 2462 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Imputation of Knowledge</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any proceeding under this section, a railroad carrier is deemed to know the acts of its officers and agents.</p>
