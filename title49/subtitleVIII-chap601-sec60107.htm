<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a State authority files an application not later than September 30 of a calendar year, the Secretary of Transportation shall pay not more than 80 percent of the cost of the personnel, equipment, and activities the authority reasonably requires during the next calendar year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to carry out a safety program under a certification under section 60105 of this title or an agreement under section 60106 of this title; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After notifying and consulting with a State authority, the Secretary may withhold any part of a payment when the Secretary decides that the authority is not carrying out satisfactorily a safety program or not acting satisfactorily as an agent. The Secretary may pay an authority under this section only when the authority ensures the Secretary that it will provide the remaining costs of a safety program and that the total State amount spent for a safety program (excluding grants of the United States Government) will at least equal the average amount spent for gas and hazardous liquid safety programs for the 3 fiscal years prior to the fiscal year in which the Secretary makes the payment, except when the Secretary waives this requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Apportionment and Method of Payment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall apportion the amount appropriated to carry out this section among the States. A payment may be made under this section in installments, in advance, or on a reimbursable basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the form of, and way of filing, an application under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) reporting and fiscal procedures the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the proper accounting of money of the Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) qualifications for a State to meet to receive a payment under this section, including qualifications for State employees who perform inspection activities under section 60105 or 60106 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The qualifications prescribed under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the experience and training of the employee;</p>
