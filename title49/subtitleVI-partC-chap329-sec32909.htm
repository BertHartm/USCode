<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rule&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and because the terms are synonymous.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1) and (2), the words &ldquo;apply for review&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the text of 15:2004(a) (last sentence) is omitted because 15:2002(d) is executed and is not a part of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the words &ldquo;adversely affected&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;regulation prescribed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;final rule&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The text of 15:2004(a) (4th sentence) and 2008(e)(3)(B) is omitted because 5:ch. 7 applies unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;a regulation prescribing an amendment of a standard submitted to Congress&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;or in the case of an amendment submitted to each House of Congress&rdquo; in 15:2004(a), and the words &ldquo;the Secretary of Transportation or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, whoever prescribed the regulation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the officer who prescribed the rule&rdquo;, for clarity. The words &ldquo;a record of the proceeding in which the regulation was prescribed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the written submissions and other materials in the proceeding upon which such rule was based&rdquo; in 15:2004(a) and &ldquo;the written submissions to, and transcript of, the written and oral proceedings on which the rule was based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code&rdquo; in 15:2008(e)(3) for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;on request of the petitioner&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;If the petitioner applies to the court in a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section for leave to make additional submissions&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;to receive additional submissions&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to provide additional opportunity to make such submissions&rdquo;, for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the words &ldquo;amend .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the regulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;amended .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. regulation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;modify .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the rule&rdquo; and &ldquo;modified .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rule&rdquo;, respectively, for consistency in the chapter and because &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; is synonymous with &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;and not in lieu of&rdquo; in 15:2004(d) are omitted as surplus.</p>
