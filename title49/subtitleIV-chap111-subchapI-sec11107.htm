<p class="note-body">The section restates the source provisions for clarity and to reflect the transfer to the Secretary of Transportation of the Commission's functions related to safety of operations. The words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 11101(c) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of subsection (f) of this section&rdquo; to cite the corresponding revised subsection. The word &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary in view of subchapter II of chapter 103 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;leases, contracts, or other arrangements&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy.</p>
