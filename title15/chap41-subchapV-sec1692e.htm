<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The representation or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of any person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment, or sale of any <!-- PDFPage:1254 -->property or wages of any person unless such action is lawful and the debt collector or creditor intends to take such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The false representation or implication that a sale, referral, or other transfer of any interest in a debt shall cause the consumer to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The false representation or implication that accounts have been turned over to innocent purchasers for value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) The false representation or implication that documents are legal process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) The use of any business, company, or organization name other than the true name of the debt collector's business, company, or organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The false representation or implication that documents are not legal process forms or do not require action by the consumer.</p>
