<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;Unit investment trust&rdquo; means an investment company which (A) is organized under a trust indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar instrument, (B) does not have a board of directors, and (C) issues only redeemable securities, each of which represents an undivided interest in a unit of specified securities; but does not include a voting trust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;Management company&rdquo; means any investment company other than a face-amount certificate company or a unit investment trust.</p>
