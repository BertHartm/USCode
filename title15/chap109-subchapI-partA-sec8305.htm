<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition on Federal assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including regulations), no Federal assistance <!-- PDFPage:2067 -->may be provided to any swaps entity with respect to any swap, security-based swap, or other activity of the swaps entity.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Swaps entity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;swaps entity&rdquo; means any swap dealer, security-based swap dealer, major swap participant, major security-based swap participant, that is registered under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;swaps entity&rdquo; does not include any major swap participant or major security-based swap participant that is an insured depository institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Affiliates of insured depository institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The prohibition on Federal assistance contained in subsection (a) does not apply to and shall not prevent an insured depository institution from having or establishing an affiliate which is a swaps entity, as long as such insured depository institution is part of a bank holding company, or savings and loan holding company, that is supervised by the Federal Reserve and such swaps entity affiliate complies with sections 371c and 371c&ndash;1 of title 12 and such other requirements as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities Exchange Commission, as appropriate, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, may determine to be necessary and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Only bona fide hedging and traditional bank activities permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The prohibition in subsection (a) shall apply to any insured depository institution unless the insured depository institution limits its swap or security-based swap activities to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Hedging and other similar risk mitigating activities directly related to the insured depository institution's activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Acting as a swaps entity for swaps or security-based swaps involving rates or reference assets that are permissible for investment by a national bank under the paragraph designated as &ldquo;Seventh.&rdquo; of section 24 of title 12, other than as described in paragraph (3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Acting as a swaps entity for credit default swaps, including swaps or security-based swaps referencing the credit risk of asset-backed securities as defined in section 3(a)(77) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(77)) (as amended by this Act) shall not be considered a bank permissible activity for purposes of subsection (d)(2) unless such swaps or security-based swaps are cleared by a derivatives clearing organization (as such term is defined in section la of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. la)) or a clearing agency (as such term is defined in section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c)) that is registered, or exempt from registration, as a derivatives clearing organization under the Commodity Exchange Act or as a clearing agency under the Securities Exchange Act, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Existing swaps and security-based swaps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The prohibition in subsection (a) shall only apply to swaps or security-based swaps entered into by an insured depository institution after the end of the transition period described in subsection (f).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transition period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent an insured depository institution qualifies as a &ldquo;swaps entity&rdquo; and would be subject to the Federal assistance prohibition in subsection (a), the appropriate Federal banking agency, after consulting with and considering the views of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities Exchange Commission, as appropriate, shall permit the insured depository institution up to 24 months to divest the swaps entity or cease the activities that require registration as a swaps entity. In establishing the appropriate transition period to effect such divestiture or cessation of activities, which may include making the swaps entity an affiliate of the insured depository institution, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall take into account and make written findings regarding the potential impact of such divestiture or cessation of activities on the insured depository institution's (1) mortgage lending, (2) small business lending, (3) job creation, and (4) capital formation versus the potential negative impact on insured depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The appropriate Federal banking agency may consider such other factors as may be appropriate. The appropriate Federal banking agency may place such conditions on the insured depository institution's divestiture or ceasing of activities of the swaps entity as it deems necessary and appropriate. The transition period under this subsection may be extended by the appropriate Federal banking agency, after consultation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, for a period of up to 1 additional year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Excluded entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;swaps entity&rdquo; shall not include any insured depository <!-- PDFPage:2068 -->institution under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.] or a covered financial company under title II which is in a conservatorship, receivership, or a bridge bank operated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">All swaps entities that are FDIC insured institutions that are put into receivership or declared insolvent as a result of swap or security-based swap activity of the swaps entities shall be subject to the termination or transfer of that swap or security-based swap activity in accordance with applicable law prescribing the treatment of those contracts. No taxpayer funds shall be used to prevent the receivership of any swap entity resulting from swap or security-based swap activity of the swaps entity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Institutions that pose a systemic risk and are subject to heightened prudential supervision as regulated under section 5323 of title 12</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All swaps entities that are institutions that pose a systemic risk and are subject to heightened prudential supervision as regulated under section 5323 of title 12, that are put into receivership or declared insolvent as a result of swap or security-based swap activity of the swaps entities shall be subject to the termination or transfer of that swap or security-based swap activity in accordance with applicable law prescribing the treatment of those contracts. No taxpayer funds shall be used to prevent the receivership of any swap entity resulting from swap or security-based swap activity of the swaps entity.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No losses to taxpayers</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Prohibition on unregulated combination of swaps entities and banking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At no time following adoption of the rules in subsection (k) may a bank or bank holding company be permitted to be or become a swap entity unless it conducts its swap or security-based swap activity in compliance with such minimum standards set by its prudential regulator as are reasonably calculated to permit the swaps entity to conduct its swap or security-based swap activities in a safe and sound manner and mitigate systemic risk.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In prescribing rules, the prudential regulator for a swaps entity shall consider the following factors:</p>

Any such determination by the Financial Stability Oversight Council of a prohibition of federal assistance shall be made on an institution-by-institution basis, and shall require the vote of not fewer than two-thirds of the members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which must include the vote by the Chairman of the Council, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
