<p class="statutory-body">Any security may be registered with the Commission under the terms and conditions hereinafter provided, by filing a registration statement in triplicate, at least one of which shall be signed by each issuer, its principal executive officer or officers, its principal financial officer, its comptroller or principal accounting officer, and the majority of its board of directors or persons performing similar functions (or, if there is no board of directors or persons performing similar functions, by the majority of the persons or board having the power of management of the issuer), and in case the issuer is a foreign or Territorial person by its duly authorized representative in the United States; except that when such registration statement relates to a security issued by a foreign government, or political subdivision thereof, it need be signed only by the underwriter of such security. Signatures of all such persons when written on the said registration statements shall be presumed to have been so written by authority of the person whose signature is so affixed and the burden of proof, in the event such authority shall be denied, shall be upon the party denying the same. The affixing of any signature without the authority of the purported signer shall constitute a violation of this subchapter. A registration statement shall be deemed effective only as to the securities specified therein as proposed to be offered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Registration fee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recovery of cost of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, in accordance with this subsection, collect registration fees that <!-- PDFPage:104 -->are designed to recover the costs to the government of the securities registration process, and costs related to such process, including enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking activities, administration, legal services, and international regulatory activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fee payment required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the time of filing a registration statement, the applicant shall pay to the Commission a fee at a rate that shall be equal to $92 per $1,000,000 of the maximum aggregate price at which such securities are proposed to be offered, except that during fiscal year 2003 and any succeeding fiscal year such fee shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (5) or (6).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Offsetting collections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees collected pursuant to this subsection for any fiscal year&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Final rate adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal year 2012 and all of the succeeding fiscal years, the Commission shall by order adjust the rate required by paragraph (2) for all of such fiscal years to a rate that, when applied to the baseline estimate of the aggregate maximum offering prices for fiscal year 2012, is reasonably likely to produce aggregate fee collections under this subsection in fiscal year 2012 equal to the target offsetting collection amount for fiscal year 2011.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Pro rata application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates per $1,000,000 required by this subsection shall be applied pro rata to amounts and balances of less than $1,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In exercising its authority under this subsection, the Commission shall not be required to comply with the provisions of section 553 of title 5. An adjusted rate prescribed under paragraph (5) or (6) and published under paragraph (10) shall not be subject to judicial review. Subject to paragraphs (3)(B) and (9)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an adjusted rate prescribed under paragraph (5) shall take effect on the later of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as hereinafter provided, the effective date of a registration statement shall be the twentieth day after the filing thereof or such earlier date as the Commission may determine, having due regard to the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, to the facility with which the nature of the securities to be registered, their relationship to the capital structure of the issuer and the rights of holders thereof can be understood, and to the public interest and the protection of investors. If any amendment to any such statement is filed prior to the effective date of such statement, the registration statement shall be deemed to have been filed when such amendment was filed; except that an amendment filed with the consent of the Commission, prior to the effective date of the registration statement, or filed pursuant to an order of the Commission, shall be treated as a part of the registration statement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incomplete or inaccurate registration statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the Commission that a registration statement is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Commission may, after notice by personal service or the sending of confirmed telegraphic notice not later than ten days after the filing of the registration statement, and opportunity for hearing (at a time fixed by the Commission) within ten days after such notice by personal service or the sending of such telegraphic notice, issue an order prior to the effective date of registration refusing to permit such statement to become ef<!-- PDFPage:107 -->fective until it has been amended in accordance with such order. When such statement has been amended in accordance with such order the Commission shall so declare and the registration shall become effective at the time provided in subsection (a) of this section or upon the date of such declaration, whichever date is the later.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effective date of amendment to registration statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An amendment filed after the effective date of the registration statement, if such amendment, upon its face, appears to the Commission not to be incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, shall become effective on such date as the Commission may determine, having due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Untrue statements or omissions in registration statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the Commission at any time that the registration statement includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Commission may, after notice by personal service or the sending of confirmed telegraphic notice, and after opportunity for hearing (at a time fixed by the Commission) within fifteen days after such notice by personal service or the sending of such telegraphic notice, issue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement. When such statement has been amended in accordance with such stop order, the Commission shall so declare and thereupon the stop order shall cease to be effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Examination for issuance of stop order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission is empowered to make an examination in any case in order to determine whether a stop order should issue under subsection (d) of this section. In making such examination the Commission or any officer or officers designated by it shall have access to and may demand the production of any books and papers of, and may administer oaths and affirmations to and examine, the issuer, underwriter, or any other person, in respect of any matter relevant to the examination, and may, in its discretion, require the production of a balance sheet exhibiting the assets and liabilities of the issuer, or its income statement, or both, to be certified to by a public or certified accountant approved by the Commission. If the issuer or underwriter shall fail to cooperate, or shall obstruct or refuse to permit the making of an examination, such conduct shall be proper ground for the issuance of a stop order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notice requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any notice required under this section shall be sent to or served on the issuer, or, in case of a foreign government or political subdivision thereof, to or on the underwriter, or, in the case of a foreign or Territorial person, to or on its duly authorized representative in the United States named in the registration statement, properly directed in each case of telegraphic notice to the address given in such statement.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of this subchapter, or any rule or regulation thereunder, the Commission may publish its findings and enter an order requiring such person, and any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation, to cease and desist from committing or causing such violation and any future violation of the same provision, rule, or regulation. Such order may, in addition to requiring a person to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such provision, rule, or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and within such time as the Commission may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the Commission deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for such period of time as the Commission may specify, with such provision, rule, or regulation with respect to any security, any issuer, or any other person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notice instituting proceedings pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall fix a hearing date not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after service of the notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Commission with the consent of any respondent so served.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary order</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Commission determines that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified in the notice instituting proceedings pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to result in significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public interest, including, but not limited to, losses to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, prior to the completion of the proceedings, the Commission may enter a temporary order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the violation or threatened violation and to take such action to prevent the violation or threatened violation and to prevent dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors, <!-- PDFPage:108 -->or substantial harm to the public interest as the Commission deems appropriate pending completion of such proceeding. Such an order shall be entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, unless the Commission determines that notice and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest. A temporary order shall become effective upon service upon the respondent and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply only to a respondent that acts, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct acted, as a broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment company, municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, government securities dealer, or transfer agent, or is, or was at the time of the alleged misconduct, an associated person of, or a person seeking to become associated with, any of the foregoing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of temporary orders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time after the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the respondent may apply to the Commission to have the order set aside, limited, or suspended. If the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior Commission hearing, the respondent may, within 10 days after the date on which the order was served, request a hearing on such application and the Commission shall hold a hearing and render a decision on such application at the earliest possible time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 10 days after the date the respondent was served with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered with a prior Commission hearing, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 10 days after the Commission renders a decision on an application and hearing under paragraph (1), with respect to any temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior Commission hearing,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the respondent may apply to the United States district court for the district in which the respondent resides or has its principal place of business, or for the District of Columbia, for an order setting aside, limiting, or suspending the effectiveness or enforcement of the order, and the court shall have jurisdiction to enter such an order. A respondent served with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior Commission hearing may not apply to the court except after hearing and decision by the Commission on the respondent's application under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No automatic stay of temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The commencement of proceedings under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Commission's order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exclusive review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 77i(a) of this title shall not apply to a temporary order entered pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authority to enter order requiring accounting and disgorgement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any cease-and-desist proceeding under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may enter an order requiring accounting and disgorgement, including reasonable interest. The Commission is authorized to adopt rules, regulations, and orders concerning payments to investors, rates of interest, periods of accrual, and such other matters as it deems appropriate to implement this subsection.</p>

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. No objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission. The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the origi<!-- PDFPage:109 -->nal order. The jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree, affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any order of the Commission, shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standard of reasonableness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of this section, what constitutes reasonable investigation and reasonable ground for belief, the standard of reasonableness shall be that required of a prudent man in the management of his own property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective date of registration statement with regard to underwriters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person becomes an underwriter with respect to the security after the part of the registration statement with respect to which his liability is asserted has become effective, then for the purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of this section such part of the registration statement shall be considered as having become effective with respect to such person as of the time when he became an underwriter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Measure of damages; undertaking for payment of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The suit authorized under subsection (a) of this section may be to recover such damages as shall represent the difference between the amount paid for the security (not exceeding the price at which the security was offered to the public) and (1) the value thereof as of the time such suit was brought, or (2) the price at which such security shall have been disposed of in the market before suit, or (3) the price at which such security shall have been disposed of after suit but before judgment if such damages shall be less than the damages representing the difference between the amount paid for the security (not exceeding the price at which the security was offered to the public) and the value thereof as of the time such suit was brought: <em>Provided</em>, That if the defendant proves that any portion or all of such damages represents other than the depreciation in value of such security resulting from such part of the registration statement, with respect to which his liability is asserted, not being true or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, such portion of or all such damages shall not be recoverable. In no event shall any underwriter (unless such underwriter shall have knowingly received from the issuer for acting as an underwriter some benefit, directly or indirectly, in which all other underwriters similarly situated did not share in proportion to their respective interests in the underwriting) be liable in any suit or as a consequence of suits authorized under subsection (a) of this section for damages in excess of the total price at which the securities underwritten by him and distributed to the public were offered to the public. In any suit under this or any other section of this subchapter the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit, including reasonable attorney's fees, and if judgment shall be rendered against a party litigant, upon the motion of the other party litigant, such costs may be assessed in favor of such party litigant (whether or not such undertaking has been required) if the court believes the suit or the defense to have been without merit, in an amount sufficient to reimburse him for the reasonable expenses incurred by him, in connection with such suit, such costs to be taxed in the manner usually provided for taxing of costs in the court in which the suit was heard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Joint and several liability; liability of outside director</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), all or any one or more of the persons specified in subsection (a) of this section shall be jointly and severally liable, and every person who becomes liable to make any payment under this section may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if sued separately, would have been liable to make the same payment, unless the person who has become liable was, and the other was not, guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The liability of an outside director under subsection (e) of this section shall be determined in accordance with section 78u&ndash;4(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;outside director&rdquo; shall have the meaning given such term by rule or regulation of the Commission.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:112 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Offering price to public as maximum amount recoverable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In no case shall the amount recoverable under this section exceed the price at which the security was offered to the public.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The fees required by this subparagraph shall be paid, and all necessary supporting data on sales or offers for sales required under subparagraph (A), shall be reported on the same schedule as would have been applicable had the issuer not relied on the exemption provided in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Availability of preemption contingent on payment of fees</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Delays</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, delays in payment of fees or underpayments of fees that are promptly remedied shall not constitute a refusal to pay fees.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Fees not permitted on listed securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), no filing or fee may be required with respect to any security that is a covered security pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section, or will be such a covered security upon completion of the transaction, or is a security of the same issuer that is equal in seniority or that is a senior security to a security that is a covered security pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Enforcement of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall prohibit the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State from suspending the offer or sale of securities within such State as a result of the failure to submit any filing or fee required under law and permitted under this section.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:117 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Offering document</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Commission shall have authority from time to time to make, amend, and rescind such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, including rules and regulations governing registration statements and prospectuses for various classes of securities and issuers, and defining accounting, technical, and trade terms used in this subchapter. Among other things, the Commission shall have authority, for the purposes of this subchapter, to prescribe the form or forms in which required information shall be set forth, the items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earning statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of accounts, in the appraisal or valuation of assets and liabilities, in the determination of depreciation and depletion, in the differentiation of recurring and nonrecurring income, in the differentiation of investment and operating income, and in the preparation, where the Commission deems it necessary or desirable, of consolidated balance sheets or income accounts of any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any person under direct or indirect common control with the issuer. The rules and regulations of the Commission shall be effective upon publication in the manner which the Commission shall prescribe. No provision of this subchapter imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule or regulation of the Commission, notwithstanding that such rule or regulation may, after such act or omission, be amended or rescinded or be determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For the purpose of all investigations which, in the opinion of the Commission, are necessary and proper for the enforcement of this subchapter, any member of the Commission or any officer or officers designated by it are empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, or other documents which the Commission deems relevant or material to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of such documentary evidence may be required from any place in the United States or any Territory at any designated place of hearing.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:119 --><p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission is authorized to cooperate with any association composed of duly constituted representatives of State governments whose primary assignment is the regulation of the securities business within those States, and which, in the judgment of the Commission, could assist in effectuating greater uniformity in Federal-State securities matters. The Commission shall, at its discretion, cooperate, coordinate, and share information with such an association for the purposes of carrying out the policies and projects set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is the declared policy of this subsection that there should be greater Federal and State cooperation in securities matters, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) maximum effectiveness of regulation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) maximum uniformity in Federal and State regulatory standards,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) minimum interference with the business of capital formation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a substantial reduction in costs and paperwork to diminish the burdens of raising investment capital (particularly by small business) and to diminish the costs of the administration of the Government programs involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The purpose of this subsection is to engender cooperation between the Commission, any such association of State securities officials, and other duly constituted securities associations in the following areas:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the sharing of information regarding the registration or exemption of securities issues applied for in the various States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the development and maintenance of uniform securities forms and procedures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the development of a uniform exemption from registration for small issuers which can be agreed upon among several States or between the States and the Federal Government. The Commission shall have the authority to adopt such an exemption as agreed upon for Federal purposes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing preemption of State law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In order to carry out these policies and purposes, the Commission shall conduct an annual conference as well as such other meetings as are deemed necessary, to which representatives from such securities associations, securities self-regulatory organizations, agencies, and private organizations involved in capital formation shall be invited to participate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For fiscal year 1982, and for each of the three succeeding fiscal years, there are authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out the policies, provisions, and purposes of this subsection. Any sums so appropriated shall remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the Commission nor any other person shall be required to establish any procedures not specifically required by the securities laws, as that term is defined in section 78c(a)(47) of this title, or by chapter 5 of title 5, in connection with cooperation, coordination, or consultation with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any association referred to in paragraph (1) or (3) or any conference or meeting referred to in paragraph (4), while such association, conference, or meeting is carrying out activities in furtherance of the provisions of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any forum, agency, or organization, or group referred to in section 80c&ndash;1 of this title, while such forum, agency, organization, or group is carrying out activities in furtherance of the provisions of such section 80c&ndash;1.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) states that the plaintiff will not accept any payment for serving as a representative party on behalf of a class beyond the plaintiff's pro rata share of any recovery, except as ordered or approved by the court in accordance with paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonwaiver of attorney-client privilege</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that, not later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff of the purported class.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than 90 days after the date on which a notice is published under subparagraph (A)(i), the court shall consider any motion made by a purported class member in response to the notice, including any motion by a class member who is not individually named as a plaintiff in the complaint or complaints, and shall appoint as lead plaintiff the member or members of the purported plaintiff class that the court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the &ldquo;most adequate plaintiff&rdquo;) in accordance with this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Consolidated actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same claim or claims arising under this subchapter has been filed, and any party has sought to consolidate those actions for pretrial purposes or for trial, the court shall not make the determination required by clause (i) until after the decision on the motion to consolidate is rendered. As soon as practicable after such decision is rendered, the court shall appoint the most adequate plaintiff as lead plaintiff for the consolidated actions in accordance with this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Rebuttable presumption</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Subject to subclause (II), for purposes of clause (i), the court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff in any private action arising under this subchapter is the person or group of persons that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a notice under subparagraph (A)(i);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class; and</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Rebuttal evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The presumption described in subclause (I) may be rebutted only upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff class that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:124 --><h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, discovery relating to whether a member or members of the purported plaintiff class is the most adequate plaintiff may be conducted by a plaintiff only if the plaintiff first demonstrates a reasonable basis for a finding that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff is incapable of adequately representing the class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Selection of lead counsel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The most adequate plaintiff shall, subject to the approval of the court, select and retain counsel to represent the class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Restrictions on professional plaintiffs</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recovery by plaintiffs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The share of any final judgment or of any settlement that is awarded to a representative party serving on behalf of a class shall be equal, on a per share basis, to the portion of the final judgment or settlement awarded to all other members of the class. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the award of reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages) directly relating to the representation of the class to any representative party serving on behalf of the class.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Restrictions on settlements under seal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms and provisions of any settlement agreement of a class action shall not be filed under seal, except that on motion of any party to the settlement, the court may order filing under seal for those portions of a settlement agreement as to which good cause is shown for such filing under seal. For purposes of this paragraph, good cause shall exist only if publication of a term or provision of a settlement agreement would cause direct and substantial harm to any party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Restrictions on payment of attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Total attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses awarded by the court to counsel for the plaintiff class shall not exceed a reasonable percentage of the amount of any damages and prejudgment interest actually paid to the class.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Disclosure of settlement terms to class members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any proposed or final settlement agreement that is published or otherwise disseminated to the class shall include each of the following statements, along with a cover page summarizing the information contained in such statements:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the settling parties agree on the average amount of damages per share that would be recoverable if the plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged under this subchapter, a statement concerning the average amount of such potential damages per share.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Disagreement on amount of damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the parties do not agree on the average amount of damages per share that would be recoverable if the plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged under this subchapter, a statement from each settling party concerning the issue or issues on which the parties disagree.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Inadmissibility for certain purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A statement made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) concerning the amount of damages shall not be admissible in any Federal or State judicial action or administrative proceeding, other than an action or proceeding arising out of such statement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Statement of attorneys&rsquo; fees or costs sought</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any of the settling parties or their counsel intend to apply to the court for an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees or costs from any fund established as part of the settlement, a statement indicating which parties or counsel intend to make such an application, the amount of fees and costs that will be sought (including the amount of such fees and costs determined on an average per share basis), and a brief explanation supporting the fees and costs sought.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Identification of lawyers&rsquo; representatives</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such other information as may be required by the court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Attorney conflict of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a plaintiff class is represented by an attorney who directly owns or otherwise has a beneficial interest in the securities that are the subject of the litigation, the court shall make a determination of whether such ownership or other interest constitutes a conflict of interest sufficient to disqualify the attorney from representing the plaintiff class.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Stay of discovery; preservation of evidence</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any private action arising under this subchapter, all discovery and other proceedings <!-- PDFPage:125 -->shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss, unless the court finds, upon the motion of any party, that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preservation of evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the pendency of any stay of discovery pursuant to this subsection, unless otherwise ordered by the court, any party to the action with actual notice of the allegations contained in the complaint shall treat all documents, data compilations (including electronically recorded or stored data), and tangible objects that are in the custody or control of such person and that are relevant to the allegations, as if they were the subject of a continuing request for production of documents from an opposing party under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Sanction for willful violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A party aggrieved by the willful failure of an opposing party to comply with paragraph (2) may apply to the court for an order awarding appropriate sanctions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Circumvention of stay of discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon a proper showing, a court may stay discovery proceedings in any private action in a State court as necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments, in an action subject to a stay of discovery pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sanctions for abusive litigation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Mandatory review by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any private action arising under this subchapter, upon final adjudication of the action, the court shall include in the record specific findings regarding compliance by each party and each attorney representing any party with each requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as to any complaint, responsive pleading, or dispositive motion.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mandatory sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court makes a finding under paragraph (1) that a party or attorney violated any requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as to any complaint, responsive pleading, or dispositive motion, the court shall impose sanctions on such party or attorney in accordance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), for purposes of paragraph (2), the court shall adopt a presumption that the appropriate sanction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for failure of any responsive pleading or dispositive motion to comply with any requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is an award to the opposing party of the reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for substantial failure of any complaint to comply with any requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is an award to the opposing party of the reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and other expenses incurred in the action.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rebuttal evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The presumption described in subparagraph (A) may be rebutted only upon proof by the party or attorney against whom sanctions are to be imposed that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and other expenses will impose an unreasonable burden on that party or attorney and would be unjust, and the failure to make such an award would not impose a greater burden on the party in whose favor sanctions are to be imposed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the violation of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was de minimis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the party or attorney against whom sanctions are to be imposed meets its burden under subparagraph (B), the court shall award the sanctions that the court deems appropriate pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Defendant's right to written interrogatories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any private action arising under this subchapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that a defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the court shall, when requested by a defendant, submit to the jury a written interrogatory on the issue of each such defendant's state of mind at the time the alleged violation occurred.</p>
