<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reinvestigation required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer's file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly of such dispute, the agency shall reinvestigate free of charge and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph (5), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extension of period to reinvestigate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the 30-day period described in subparagraph (A) may be extended for not more than 15 additional days if the consumer reporting agency receives information from the consumer during that 30-day period that is relevant to the reinvestigation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitations on extension of period to reinvestigate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any reinvestigation in which, during the 30-day period described in subparagraph (A), the information that is the subject of the reinvestigation is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or the consumer reporting agency determines that the information cannot be verified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prompt notice of dispute to furnisher of information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the expiration of the 5-business-day period beginning on the date on which a consumer reporting agency receives notice of a dispute from any consumer in accordance with paragraph (1), the agency shall provide notification of the dispute to any person who provided any item of information in dispute, at the address and in the manner established with the person. The notice shall include all relevant information regarding the dispute that the agency has received from the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Provision of other information from consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The consumer reporting agency shall promptly provide to the person who provided the information in dispute all relevant information regarding the dispute that is received by the agency from the consumer after the period referred to in subparagraph (A) and before the end of the period referred to in paragraph (1)(A).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a consumer reporting agency may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under that paragraph if the agency reasonably determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon making any determination in accordance with subparagraph (A) that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, a consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of such determination not later than 5 business days after making such determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirements relating to reinsertion of previously deleted material</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Certification of accuracy of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any information is deleted from a consumer's file pursuant to subparagraph (A), the information may not be reinserted in the file by the consumer reporting agency unless the person who furnishes the information certifies that the information is complete and accurate.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Notice to consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any information that has been deleted from a consumer's file pursuant to subparagraph (A) is reinserted in the file, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of the reinsertion in writing not later than 5 business days after the reinsertion or, if authorized by the consumer <!-- PDFPage:1163 -->for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Automated reinvestigation system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis shall implement an automated system through which furnishers of information to that consumer reporting agency may report the results of a reinvestigation that finds incomplete or inaccurate information in a consumer's file to other such consumer reporting agencies.</p>
