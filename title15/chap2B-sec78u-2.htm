<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any proceeding instituted under section 78u&ndash;3 of this title against any person, the Commission may impose a civil penalty, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such person&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is or was a cause of the violation of any provision of this chapter, or any rule or regulation issued under this chapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:376 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Maximum amount of penalty</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) First tier</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of public interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In considering under this section whether a penalty is in the public interest, the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether the act or omission for which such penalty is assessed involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the harm to other persons resulting either directly or indirectly from such act or omission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which any person was unjustly enriched, taking into account any restitution made to persons injured by such behavior;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether such person previously has been found by the Commission, another appropriate regulatory agency, or a self-regulatory organization to have violated the Federal securities laws, State securities laws, or the rules of a self-regulatory organization, has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from violations of such laws or rules, or has been convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of violations of such laws or of any felony or misdemeanor described in section 78<em>o</em>(b)(4)(B) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the need to deter such person and other persons from committing such acts or omissions; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Evidence concerning ability to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding in which the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may impose a penalty under this section, a respondent may present evidence of the respondent's ability to pay such penalty. The Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may, in its discretion, consider such evidence in determining whether such penalty is in the public interest. Such evidence may relate to the extent of such person's ability to continue in business and the collectability of a penalty, taking into account any other claims of the United States or third parties upon such person's assets and the amount of such person's assets.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authority to enter order requiring accounting and disgorgement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding in which the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may impose a penalty under this section, the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may enter an order requiring accounting and disgorgement, including reasonable interest.
