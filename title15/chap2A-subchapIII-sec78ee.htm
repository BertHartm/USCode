<p class="statutory-body">Every national securities exchange shall pay to the Commission on or before March 15 of each calendar year a fee in an amount equal to one three-hundredths of 1 per centum of the aggregate dollar amount of the sales of securities (other than bonds, debentures, and other evidences of indebtedness) transacted on such national securities exchange during each preceding calendar year to which this section applies. Every registered broker and dealer shall pay to the Commission on or before March 15 of each calendar year a fee in an amount equal to one three-hundredths of 1 per centum of the aggregate dollar amount of the sales of securities registered on a national securities exchange (other than bonds, debentures, and other evidences of indebtedness) transacted by such broker or dealer otherwise than on such an exchange during each preceding calendar year: <em>Provided, however</em>, That no payment shall be required for any calendar year in which such payment would be less than one hundred dollars. The Commission, by rule, may exempt any sale of securities or any class of sales of securities from any fee imposed by this section, if the Commission finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the equal regulation of markets and brokers and dealers, and the development of a national market system.</p>
