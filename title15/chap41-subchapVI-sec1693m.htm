<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 1693h of this title, a person may not be held liable in any action brought under this section for a violation of this subchapter if the person shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Good faith compliance with rule, regulation, or interpretation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section or section 1693n&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1693m_1_target" name="1693m_1">1</a></sup> of this title imposing any liability shall apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Bureau or the Board or in conformity with any interpretation or approval by an official or employee of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or the Federal Reserve System duly authorized by the Bureau or the Board to issue such interpretations or approvals under such procedures as the Bureau or the Board may prescribe therefor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any failure to make disclosure in proper form if a financial institution utilized an appropriate model clause issued by the Bureau or the Board,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">notwithstanding that after such act, omission, or failure has occurred, such rule, regulation, approval, or model clause is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notification to consumer prior to action; adjustment of consumer's account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person has no liability under this section for any failure to comply with any requirement under this subchapter if, prior to the institution of an action under this section, the person notifies the consumer concerned of the failure, complies with the requirements of this subchapter, and makes an appropriate adjustment to the consumer's account and pays actual damages or, where applicable, damages in accordance with section 1693h of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Action in bad faith or for harassment; attorney's fees</h4>
