<p class="statutory-body">(3) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1189 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reasonable procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Block</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a copy of an identity theft report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the information may be a result of identity theft;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that a block has been requested under this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notification to consumer</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Significance of block</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for resellers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No reseller file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reseller with file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and</p>

Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception for verification companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a(p) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to <!-- PDFPage:1213 -->you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) provide more than 1 disclosure per loan transaction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) provide the disclosure required by this subsection when another person has made the disclosure to the consumer for that loan transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) No obligation for content</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The obligation of any person pursuant to this subsection shall be limited solely to providing a copy of the information that was received from the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limit on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No person has liability under this subsection for the content of that information or for the omission of any information within the report provided by the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Person defined as excluding enterprise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; does not include an enterprise (as defined in paragraph (6) of section 4502 of title 12).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition on disclosure clauses null and void</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any provision in a contract that prohibits the disclosure of a credit score by a person who makes or arranges loans or a consumer reporting agency is void.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No liability for disclosure under this subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A lender shall not have liability under any contractual provision for disclosure of a credit score pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003] (commonly referred to as &lsquo;FACTA&rsquo;) [Pub. L. 108&ndash;159, see Short Title of 2003 Amendment note set out under section 1601 of this title] was enacted into <!-- PDFPage:1226 -->law in 2003 and 1 of the purposes of such Act is to prevent criminals from obtaining access to consumers&rsquo; private financial and credit information in order to reduce identity theft and credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) As part of that law, the Congress enacted a requirement, through an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], that no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the card holder at the point of the sale or transaction.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Many merchants understood that this requirement would be satisfied by truncating the account number down to the last 5 digits based in part on the language of the provision as well as the publicity in the aftermath of the passage of the law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Almost immediately after the deadline for compliance passed, hundreds of lawsuits were filed alleging that the failure to remove the expiration date was a willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act even where the account number was properly truncated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) None of these lawsuits contained an allegation of harm to any consumer's identity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Experts in the field agree that proper truncation of the card number, by itself as required by the amendment made by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003], regardless of the inclusion of the expiration date, prevents a potential fraudster from perpetrating identity theft or credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Despite repeatedly being denied class certification, the continued appealing and filing of these lawsuits represents a significant burden on the hundreds of companies that have been sued and could well raise prices to consumers without corresponding consumer protection benefit.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this Act [amending this section and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and section 1601 of this title] is to ensure that consumers suffering from any actual harm to their credit or identity are protected while simultaneously limiting abusive lawsuits that do not protect consumers but only result in increased cost to business and potentially increased prices to consumers.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Retroactive Effect of 2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;241, &sect;3(b), June 3, 2008, 122 Stat. 1566, provided that: &ldquo;The amendment made by subsection (a) [amending this section] shall apply to any action, other than an action which has become final, that is brought for a violation of [section] 605(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681c(g)] to which such amendment applies without regard to whether such action is brought before or after the date of the enactment of this Act [June 3, 2008].&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Compliance with the requirements imposed under this subchapter shall be enforced under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] by the Federal Trade Commission with respect to consumer reporting agencies and all other persons subject thereto, except to the extent that enforcement of the requirements imposed under this subchapter is specifically committed to some other government agency under subsection (b) hereof. For the purpose of the exercise by the Federal Trade Commission of its functions and powers under the Federal Trade Commission Act, a violation of any requirement or prohibition imposed under this subchapter shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce in violation of section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 45(a)] and shall be subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission under section 5(b) thereof [15 U.S.C. 45(b)] with respect to any consumer reporting agency or person subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to this subsection, irrespective of whether that person is engaged in commerce or meets any other jurisdictional tests in the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission shall have such procedural, investigative, and enforcement powers, including the power to issue procedural rules in enforcing compliance with the requirements imposed under this subchapter and to require the filing of reports, the production of documents, and the appearance of witnesses as though the applicable terms and conditions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were part of this subchapter.

In such action, such person shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 per violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining the amount of a civil penalty under subparagraph (A), the court shall take into account the degree of culpability, any history of prior such conduct, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a court may not impose any civil penalty on a person for a violation of section 1681s&ndash;2(a)(1) of this title unless the person has been enjoined from committing the violation, or ordered not to commit the violation, in an action or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission, and has violated the injunction or order, and the court may not impose any civil penalty for any violation occurring before the date of the violation of the injunction or order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate&rdquo; means having specific knowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer, that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of the information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the creditor did not previously report the date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency and the date of delinquency cannot be reasonably obtained as provided in clause (ii), the person establishes and follows reasonable procedures to ensure the date reported as the date of delinquency precedes the date on which the account is placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action, and reports such date to the credit reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Duties of furnishers upon notice of identity theft-related information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reasonable procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person that furnishes information to any consumer reporting agency shall have in place reasonable procedures to respond to any notification that it receives from a consumer reporting agency under section 1681c&ndash;2 of this title relating to information resulting from identity theft, to prevent that person from refurnishing such blocked information.</p>
