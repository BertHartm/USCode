<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness,<sup><a href="#1681_1_target" name="1681_1">1</a></sup> credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reasonable procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reinvestigations of disputed information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reinvestigation required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Notice to consumer</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Procedures to prevent reappearance</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Automated reinvestigation system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis shall implement an automated system through which furnishers of information to that consumer reporting agency may report the results of a reinvestigation that finds incomplete or inaccurate information in a consumer's file to other such consumer reporting agencies.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Compliance with the requirements imposed under this subchapter shall be enforced under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] by the Federal Trade Commission with respect to consumer reporting agencies and all other persons subject thereto, except to the extent that enforcement of the requirements imposed under this subchapter is specifically committed to some other government agency under subsection (b) hereof. For the purpose of the exercise by the Federal Trade Commission of its functions and powers under the Federal Trade Commission Act, a violation of any requirement or prohibition imposed under this subchapter shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce in violation of section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 45(a)] and shall be subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission under section 5(b) thereof [15 U.S.C. 45(b)] with respect to any consumer reporting agency or person subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to this subsection, irrespective of whether that person is engaged in commerce or meets any other jurisdictional tests in the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission shall have such procedural, investigative, and enforcement powers, including the power to issue procedural rules in enforcing compliance with the requirements imposed under this subchapter and to require the filing of reports, the production of documents, and the appearance of witnesses as though the applicable terms and conditions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were part of this subchapter. Any person violating any of the provisions of this subchapter shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act as though the applicable terms and provisions thereof were part of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the event of a knowing violation, which constitutes a pattern or practice of viola<!-- PDFPage:1091 -->tions of this subchapter, the Commission may commence a civil action to recover a civil penalty in a district court of the United States against any person that violates this subchapter. In such action, such person shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 per violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining the amount of a civil penalty under subparagraph (A), the court shall take into account the degree of culpability, any history of prior such conduct, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a court may not impose any civil penalty on a person for a violation of section 1681s&ndash;2(a)(1) of this title unless the person has been enjoined from committing the violation, or ordered not to commit the violation, in an action or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission, and has violated the injunction or order, and the court may not impose any civil penalty for any violation occurring before the date of the violation of the injunction or order.</p>

The Federal Trade Commission or appropriate Federal regulator shall have the right&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to intervene in the action;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement under other authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of the exercise by any agency referred to in subsection (b) of this section of its powers under any Act referred to in that subsection, a violation of any requirement imposed under this subchapter shall be deemed to be a violation of a requirement imposed under that Act.
