<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) changes (if any) in the cost of natural gas to consumers, which are likely to result from the implementation nationally of each of such proposals, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the effects of the proposals on other provisions of this Act on gas utility rate structures.</p>
