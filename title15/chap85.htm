<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the armored car industry transports and protects such items in interstate commerce, including daily transportation of currency and food stamps valued at more than $1,000,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) armored car crew members are often subject to armed attack by individuals attempting to steal such items;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to protect themselves and the items they transport, such crew members are armed with weapons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) various States require both weapons training and a criminal record background check before licensing a crew member to carry a weapon; and</p>
