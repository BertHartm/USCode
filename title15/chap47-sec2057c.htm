<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not earlier than 180 days after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall begin the process of appointing a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel pursuant to the procedures of section 28 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2077) to study the effects on children's health of all phthalates and phthalate alternatives as used in children's toys and child care articles.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The panel shall, within 18 months after its appointment under subparagraph (A), complete an examination of the full range of phthalates that are used in products for children and shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) examine all of the potential health effects (including endocrine disrupting effects) of the full range of phthalates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consider the potential health effects of each of these phthalates both in isolation and in combination with other phthalates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) examine the likely levels of children's, pregnant women's, and others&rsquo; exposure to phthalates, based on a reasonable estimation of normal and foreseeable use and abuse of such products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) consider the cumulative effect of total exposure to phthalates, both from children's products and from other sources, such as personal care products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) review all relevant data, including the most recent, best-available, peer-reviewed, scientific studies of these phthalates and phthalate alternatives that employ objective data collection practices or employ other objective methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) consider the health effects of phthalates not only from ingestion but also as a result of dermal, hand-to-mouth, or other exposure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) consider the level at which there is a reasonable certainty of no harm to children, pregnant women, or other susceptible individuals and their offspring, considering the best available science, and using sufficient safety factors to account for uncertainties regarding exposure and susceptibility of children, pregnant women, and other potentially susceptible individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) consider possible similar health effects of phthalate alternatives used in children's toys and child care articles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The panel's examinations pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted <em>de novo</em>.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Permanent prohibition by rule</h4>
