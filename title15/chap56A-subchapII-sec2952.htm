<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Global change research</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President should direct the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Committee, to initiate discussions with other nations leading toward international protocols and other agreements to coordinate global change research activities. Such discussions should include the following issues:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Allocation of costs in global change research programs, especially with respect to major capital projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Coordination of global change research plans with those developed by international organizations such as the International Council on Scientific Unions, the World Meteorological Organization, and the United Nations Environment Program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Establishment of global change research centers and training programs for scientists, especially those from developing nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Development of innovative methods for management of international global change research, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) use of new or existing intergovernmental organizations for the coordination or funding of global change research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) creation of a limited foundation for global change research.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The prompt establishment of international projects to&mdash;</p>

Such discussions should include, but not be limited to, the following issues:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Creation of an international cooperative program to fund research related to energy efficiency, solar and other renewable energy sources, and passively safe and diversion-resistant nuclear reactors.</p>
