<p class="statutory-body">The Administration is authorized to issue trust certificates representing ownership of all or a fractional part of debentures issued by State or local development companies and guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That such trust certificates shall be based on and backed by a trust or pool approved by the Administration and composed solely of guaranteed debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions of guarantee; payment of principal and interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of the principal of and interest on trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent for purposes of this section. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed debentures which compose the trust or pool. In the event that a debenture in such trust or pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or in the event of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid debenture represents in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted debentures shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administration only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the trust certificate, it may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all debentures constituting the pool.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Administration of its ownership rights in the debentures constituting the trust or pool against which the trust certificates are issued.</p>
