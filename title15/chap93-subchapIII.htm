<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this subchapter shall take effect unless, not later than 3 years after November 12, 1999, at least a majority of the States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have enacted uniform laws and regulations governing the licensure of individuals and entities authorized to sell and solicit the purchase of insurance within the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) have enacted reciprocity laws and regulations governing the licensure of nonresident individuals and entities authorized to sell and solicit insurance within those States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniformity required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">States shall be deemed to have established the uniformity necessary to satisfy subsection (a)(1) of this section if the States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish uniform criteria regarding the integrity, personal qualifications, education, training, and experience of licensed insurance producers, including the qualification and training of sales personnel in ascertaining the appropriateness of a particular insurance product for a prospective customer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish uniform continuing education requirements for licensed insurance producers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establish uniform ethics course requirements for licensed insurance producers in conjunction with the continuing education requirements under paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establish uniform criteria to ensure that an insurance product, including any annuity contract, sold to a consumer is suitable and appropriate for the consumer based on financial information disclosed by the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) do not impose any requirement upon any insurance producer to be licensed or otherwise qualified to do business as a nonresident that has the effect of limiting or conditioning that producer's activities because of its residence <!-- PDFPage:1946 -->or place of operations, except that countersignature requirements imposed on nonresident producers shall not be deemed to have the effect of limiting or conditioning a producer's activities because of its residence or place of operations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reciprocity required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">States shall be deemed to have established the reciprocity required to satisfy subsection (a)(2) of this section if the following conditions are met:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Administrative licensing procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At least a majority of the States permit a producer that has a resident license for selling or soliciting the purchase of insurance in its home State to receive a license to sell or solicit the purchase of insurance in such majority of States as a nonresident to the same extent that such producer is permitted to sell or solicit the purchase of insurance in its State, if the producer's home State also awards such licenses on such a reciprocal basis, without satisfying any additional requirements other than submitting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a request for licensure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the application for licensure that the producer submitted to its home State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) proof that the producer is licensed and in good standing in its home State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the payment of any requisite fee to the appropriate authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Continuing education requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A majority of the States accept an insurance producer's satisfaction of its home State's continuing education requirements for licensed insurance producers to satisfy the States&rsquo; own continuing education requirements if the producer's home State also recognizes the satisfaction of continuing education requirements on such a reciprocal basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No limiting nonresident requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A majority of the States do not impose any requirement upon any insurance producer to be licensed or otherwise qualified to do business as a nonresident that has the effect of limiting or conditioning that producer's activities because of its residence or place of operations, except that countersignature requirements imposed on nonresident producers shall not be deemed to have the effect of limiting or conditioning a producer's activities because of its residence or place of operations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reciprocal reciprocity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each of the States that satisfies paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) grants reciprocity to residents of all of the other States that satisfy such paragraphs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) NAIC determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the end of the 3-year period beginning on November 12, 1999, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;NAIC&rdquo;) shall determine, in consultation with the insurance commissioners or chief insurance regulatory officials of the States, whether the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section has been achieved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The appropriate United States district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any challenge to the NAIC's determination under this section and such court shall apply the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5 when reviewing any such challenge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continued application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time, the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section no longer exists, the provisions of this subchapter shall take effect 2 years after the date on which such uniformity or reciprocity ceases to exist, unless the uniformity or reciprocity required by those provisions is satisfied before the expiration of that 2-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Savings provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring that any law, regulation, provision, or action of any State which purports to regulate insurance producers, including any such law, regulation, provision, or action which purports to regulate unfair trade practices or establish consumer protections, including countersignature laws, be altered or amended in order to satisfy the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section, unless any such law, regulation, provision, or action is inconsistent with a specific requirement of any such subsection and then only to the extent of such inconsistency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Uniform licensing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any State to adopt new or additional licensing requirements to achieve the uniformity necessary to satisfy subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Categories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Association may establish separate categories of membership for individuals and for other persons. The establishment of any such categories of membership shall be based either on the types of licensing categories that exist under State laws or on the aggregate amount of business handled by an insurance producer. No special categories of membership, and no distinct membership criteria, shall be established for members which are depository institutions or for their employees, agents, or affiliates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Membership criteria</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) suspend or revoke the membership of an insurance producer if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the producer fails to meet the applicable membership criteria of the Association; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the producer has been subject to disciplinary action pursuant to a final adjudicatory proceeding under the jurisdiction of a State insurance regulator, and the Association concludes that retention of membership in the Association would not be in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Office of consumer complaints</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) maintain records of all complaints received in accordance with paragraph (1) and make such records available to the NAIC and to each State insurance regulator for the State of residence of the consumer who filed the complaint; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Telephone and other access</h4>
