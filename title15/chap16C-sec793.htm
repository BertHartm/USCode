The sum of $3,500,000 is authorized to be appropriated for such a study. In order to assure that long-term studies can be conducted without interruption, such sums as are appropriated shall be available until expended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No action taken under the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] shall be deemed a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.].</p>

Such an evaluation shall not be required where the action in question has been preceded by compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act by the appropriate Federal agency. Any action taken under section 792 of this title which will be in effect for more than a one-year period or any action to extend an action taken under section 792 of this title to a total period of more than one year shall be subject to the full provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter.</p>
