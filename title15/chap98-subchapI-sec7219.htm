<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rules of the Board under paragraph (1) shall provide for the equitable allocation, assessment, and collection by the Board (or an agent appointed by the Board) of the fee established under paragraph (1), among issuers, in accordance with subsection (g) of this section, allowing for differentiation among classes of issuers, as appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Allocation of accounting support fees among issuers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any amount due from issuers (or a particular class of issuers) under this section to fund the budget of the Board or the standard setting body referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be allocated among and payable by each issuer (or each issuer in a particular class, as applicable) in an amount equal to the total of such amount, multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
