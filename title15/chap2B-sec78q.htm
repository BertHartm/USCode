Such records shall describe, in the aggregate, each of the financial and securities activities conducted by, and the customary sources of capital and funding of, those of its associated persons whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of such registered person, including its net capital, its liquidity, or its ability to conduct or finance its operations. The Commission, by rule, may require summary reports of such information to be filed with the Commission no more frequently than quarterly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to require additional information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or other available information, the Commission reasonably concludes that it has concerns regarding the financial or operational condition of (A) any registered broker or dealer, or (B) any registered municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, or government securities dealer for which the Commission is the appropriate regulatory agency, the Commission may require the registered person to make reports concerning the financial and securities activities of any of such person's associated persons, other than a natural person, whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of such registered person. The Commission, in requiring reports pursuant to this paragraph, shall specify the information required, the period for which it is required, the time and date on which the information must be furnished, and whether the information is to be furnished directly to the Commission or to a self-regulatory organization with primary responsibility for examining the registered person's financial and operational condition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special provisions with respect to associated persons subject to Federal banking agency regulation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Cooperation in implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In developing and implementing reporting requirements pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to associated persons subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall consult with and consider the views of each such Federal banking agency. If a Federal banking agency comments in writing on a proposed rule of the Commission under this subsection that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before adopting the proposed rule. The Commission shall, at the request of the Federal banking agency, publish such comment and response in the Federal Register at the time of publishing the adopted rule.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of banking agency reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A registered broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer shall be in compliance with any recordkeeping or reporting requirement adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection concerning an associated person that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency if such broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer utilizes for such recordkeeping or reporting requirement copies of reports filed by the associated person with the Federal banking agency pursuant to section 161 of title 12, subchapter VIII of chapter 3 of title 12, section 1817(a) of title 12, section 1467a(b) of title 12, or section 1847 of title 12.

Prior to requiring any such supplemental information, the Commission shall first request the Federal banking agency to expand its reporting requirements to include such information.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Procedure for requiring additional information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Prior to making a request pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection for information with respect to an associated person that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consult with such agency to determine whether the information required is available from such agency and for other purposes, unless the Commission determines that any delay resulting from such consultation would be inconsistent with ensuring the financial and operational condition of the broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, or government securities dealer or the stability or integrity of the securities markets.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Exclusion for examination reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the Commission to require any registered broker or dealer, or any registered municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, or government securities dealer for which the Commission is the appropriate regulatory agency, to obtain, maintain, or furnish any examination report of any Federal banking agency or any supervisory recommendations or analysis contained therein.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Confidentiality of information provided</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No information provided to or obtained by the Commission from any Federal banking agency pursuant to a request by the Commission under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph regarding any associated person which is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency may be disclosed to any other person (other than a self-regulatory organization), without the prior written approval of the Federal banking agency. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize the Commission to withhold information from Congress, or prevent the Commission from complying with a request for information from any other Federal department or agency requesting the information for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or complying with an order of a court of the United States in an action brought by the United States or the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Notice to banking agencies concerning financial and operational condition concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall notify the Federal banking agency of any concerns of the Commission regarding significant financial or operational risks resulting from the activities of any registered broker or dealer, or any registered municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, or government securities dealer for which the Commission is the appropriate regulatory agency, to any associated person thereof which is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of the Federal banking agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) &ldquo;Federal banking agency&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;Federal banking agency&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as the term &ldquo;appropriate Federal bank agency&rdquo; in section 1813(q) of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission by rule or order may exempt any person or class of persons, under such terms and conditions and for such periods as the Commission shall provide in such rule or order, from the provisions of this subsection, and the rules thereunder. In granting such exemptions, the Commission shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether information of the type required under this subsection is available from a supervisory agency (as defined in section 3401(6)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#78q_3_target" name="78q_3">3</a></sup> of title 12), a State insurance commission or similar State agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or a similar foreign regulator;</p>

Nothing in this subsection shall authorize the Commission to withhold information from Congress, or prevent the Commission from complying with a request for information from any other Federal department or agency requesting the information for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or complying with an order of a court of the United States in an action brought by the United States or the Commission. For purposes of section 552 of title 5, this subsection shall be considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such section 552. In prescribing regulations to carry out the requirements of this subsection, the Commission shall designate information described in or obtained pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3) of this subsection as confidential information for purposes of section 78x(b)(2) of this title.</p>
