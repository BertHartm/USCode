<p class="statutory-body">In conjunction with the initial organization of the Institute, the Director shall establish a program for the evaluation of inventions that are not energy-related to complement but not replace the Energy-Related Inventions Program established under section 5913 of title 42. The Director shall submit an initial implementation plan for this program to accompany the organization plan for the Institute. The implementation plan shall include specific cost estimates, implementation schedules, and mechanisms to help finance the development of technologies the program has determined to have potential. In the preparation of the plan, the Director shall consult with appropriate Federal agencies, including the Small Business Administration and the Department of Energy, State and local government organizations, university officials, and private sector organizations in order to obtain advice on how those agencies and organizations might cooperate with the expansion of this program of the Institute.</p>
