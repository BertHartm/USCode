<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;any person&rdquo; includes any State, instrumentality of a State or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official capacity. Any State, and any such instrumentality, officer, or employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In a civil action for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register, the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be protected is not functional.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Importation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any goods marked or labeled in contravention of the provisions of this section shall not be imported into the United States or admitted to entry at any customhouse of the United States. The owner, importer, or consignee of goods refused entry at any customhouse under this section may have any recourse by protest or appeal that is given under the customs revenue laws or may have the remedy given by this chapter in cases involving goods refused entry or seized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Dilution by blurring; dilution by tarnishment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Injunctive relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive, inherently or through acquired distinctiveness, shall be entitled to an injunction against another person who, at any time after the owner's mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), a mark is famous if it is widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source of the goods or services of the mark's owner. In determining whether a mark possesses the requisite degree of recognition, the court may consider all relevant factors, including the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the <!-- PDFPage:1004 -->mark, whether advertised or publicized by the owner or third parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The extent of actual recognition of the mark.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of paragraph (1), &ldquo;dilution by blurring&rdquo; is association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark. In determining whether a mark or trade name is likely to cause dilution by blurring, the court may consider all relevant factors, including the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the famous mark.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For purposes of paragraph (1), &ldquo;dilution by tarnishment&rdquo; is association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the claimed trade dress includes any mark or marks registered on the principal register, the unregistered matter, taken as a whole, is famous separate and apart from any fame of such registered marks.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Ownership of valid registration a complete bar to action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The ownership by a person of a valid registration under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register under this chapter shall be a complete bar to an action against that person, with respect to that mark, that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) seeks to prevent dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) asserts any claim of actual or likely damage or harm to the distinctiveness or reputation of a mark, label, or form of advertisement.</p>
