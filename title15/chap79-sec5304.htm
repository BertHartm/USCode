<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Solicitation of proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within one year after October 15, 1990, the Secretary shall solicit and, subject to available appropriations, select proposals on a competitive basis from applicants to carry out the program under section 5303 of this title. In order for a proposal to be considered by the Secretary, the applicant shall have in existence at the time the proposal is submitted the following qualifications:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the technical capability to enable it to make use of existing research support and facilities in carrying out its research objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a multidisciplinary research staff experienced in metal casting or other directly related technologies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the facilities and equipment capable of conducting at least laboratory scale testing or demonstration of metal casting or related processes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proposal criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each proposal shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) demonstrate the support of the metal casting industry by describing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) how industry has participated in deciding what research activities will be undertaken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) how industry will participate in the evaluation of the applicant's progress in research and development activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the extent to which industry funds are committed to the applicant's proposal;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) have a commitment for matching funds from non-Federal sources, which shall consist of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) cash, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as determined by the Secretary, the fair market value of equipment, services, materials, appropriate technology transfer activities, and other assets directly related to the proposal's cost;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include a single or multiyear management plan that outlines how the research and development activities will be administered and carried out;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) state the annual cost of the proposal and a breakdown of those costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) describe the technology transfer mechanisms the applicant will use to make available research results to industry and to other researchers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Content of management plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The management plan set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) outline the basic research and development activities expected to be performed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) outline who will conduct those research activities;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1566 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establish the time frame over which the research activities will take place; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) define the overall program management and direction by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identifying managerial, organizational and administrative procedures and responsibilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) outlining how the coordination of research and development between the individuals and organizations involved will be achieved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) demonstrating how implementation and monitoring of the progress of research projects after receipt of funding from the Secretary will be achieved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) demonstrating how recommendations and implementations on modifications to the plan will be achieved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) providing sufficient rationale to support the plan's costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Selection of proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From the proposals submitted, the Secretary shall select proposals for funding. The Secretary shall attempt to select at least four proposals. The Secretary shall select the proposals that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will best result in carrying out needed metal casting research and development in one or more of the following general areas&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) solidification and casting technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) computational modeling and design;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) processing technologies and design for energy efficiency, material conservation, environmental protection, or industrial productivity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) other areas of research, which in the judgment of the Secretary, after consulting with the Board established in section 5306 of this title, further the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
