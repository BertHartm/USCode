<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on use of acquisition strategies involving consolidation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (4), the head of a Federal agency may not carry out an acquisition strategy that includes a consolidation of contract requirements of the Federal agency with a total value of more than $2,000,000, unless the senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer for the Federal agency, before carrying out the acquisition strategy&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) conducts market research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) identifies any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer may determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified for the purposes of paragraph (1)(C) if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of each of the possible alternative contracting approaches identified under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Savings in administrative or personnel costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), savings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract requirements in a procurement unless the expected total amount of the cost savings, as determined by the senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer, is expected to be <!-- PDFPage:902 -->substantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Benefits to be considered</h4>
