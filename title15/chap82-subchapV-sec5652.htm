<p class="statutory-body">It is in the public interest for the United States Government to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintain an archive of land remote sensing data for historical, scientific, and technical purposes, including long-term global environmental monitoring;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) control the content and scope of the archive; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assure the quality, integrity, and continuity of the archive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Archiving practices</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consult with and seek the advice of users and producers of remote sensing data and data products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the need for data which may be duplicative in terms of geographical coverage <!-- PDFPage:1614 -->but which differ in terms of season, spectral bands, resolution, or other relevant factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) include, as the Secretary of the Interior considers appropriate, unenhanced data generated either by the Landsat system, pursuant to subchapter I of this chapter, or by licensees under subchapter II of this chapter;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Public domain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the expiration of any exclusive right to sell, or after relinquishment of such right, the data provided to the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive shall be in the public domain and shall be made available to requesting parties by the Secretary of the Interior at the cost of fulfilling user requests.</p>
