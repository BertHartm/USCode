<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Minimizing reporting burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall take such action as it deems necessary or appropriate, consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors, to avoid unnecessary reporting by, and minimize the compliance burdens on, registered investment companies and their affiliated persons in exercising its authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) under subsection (b)(1) of this section, if the Commission requires the filing of information, documents, and reports under that subsection on a basis more frequently than semiannually.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reports under this section in lieu of reports under other provisions of law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall issue rules and regulations permitting the filing with the Commission, and with any national securities exchange concerned, of copies of periodic reports, or of extracts therefrom, filed by any registered investment company pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, in lieu of any reports and documents required of such company under section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78m or 78<em>o</em>(d)].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Every registered investment company shall transmit to its stockholders, at least semi-annually, reports containing such of the following information and financial statements or their equivalent, as of a reasonably current date, as the Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations for the protection of investors, which reports shall not be misleading in any material respect in the light of the reports required to be filed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><em>Provided</em>, That if in the judgment of the Commission any item required under this subsection is inapplicable or inappropriate to any specified type or types of investment company, the Commission may by rules and regulations permit in lieu thereof the inclusion of such item of a comparable character as it may deem applicable or appropriate to such type or types of investment company.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:425 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, by rule, require that semiannual reports containing the information set forth in subsection (e) of this section include such other information as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#80a-29_2_target" name="80a-29_2">2</a></sup> Certificate of independent public accountants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Financial statements contained in annual reports required pursuant to subsections (a) and (e) of this section, if required by the rules and regulations of the Commission, shall be accompanied by a certificate of independent public accountants. The certificate of such independent public accountants shall be based upon an audit not less in scope or procedures followed than that which independent public accountants would ordinarily make for the purpose of presenting comprehensive and dependable financial statements, and shall contain such information as the Commission may prescribe, by rules and regulations in the public interest or for the protection of investors, as to the nature and scope of the audit and the findings and opinion of the accountants. Each such report shall state that such independent public accountants have verified securities owned, either by actual examination, or by receipt of a certificate from the custodian, as the Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#80a-29_3_target" name="80a-29_3">3</a></sup> Duties and liabilities of affiliated persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10 per centum of any class of outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) of which a registered closed-end company is the issuer or who is an officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or affiliated person of an investment adviser of such a company shall in respect of his transactions in any securities of such company (other than short-term paper) be subject to the same duties and liabilities as those imposed by section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78p] upon certain beneficial owners, directors, and officers in respect of their transactions in certain equity securities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#80a-29_2_target" name="80a-29_2">2</a></sup> Disclosure to church plan participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person that maintains a church plan that is excluded from the definition of an investment company solely by reason of section 80a&ndash;3(c)(14) of this title shall provide disclosure to plan participants, in writing, and not less frequently than annually, and for new participants joining such a plan after May 31, 1996, as soon as is practicable after joining such plan, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan, or any company or account maintained to manage or hold plan assets and interests in such plan, company, or account, are not subject to registration, regulation, or reporting under this subchapter, the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.], the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.], or State securities laws; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) plan participants and beneficiaries therefore will not be afforded the protections of those provisions.</p>
