<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 6713 of this title, a national bank and the subsidiaries of a national bank may not provide insurance in a State as principal except that this prohibition shall not apply to authorized products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorized products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, a product is authorized if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as of January 1, 1999, the Comptroller of the Currency had determined in writing that national banks may provide such product as principal, or national banks were in fact lawfully providing such product as principal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no court of relevant jurisdiction had, by final judgment, overturned a determination of the Comptroller of the Currency that national banks may provide such product as principal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the product is not title insurance, or an annuity contract the income of which is subject to tax treatment under section 72 of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any product regulated as insurance as of January 1, 1999, in accordance with the relevant State insurance law, in the State in which the product is provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any product first offered after January 1, 1999, which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a State insurance regulator determines shall be regulated as insurance in the State in which the product is provided because the product insures, guarantees, or indemnifies against liability, loss of life, loss of health, or loss through damage to or destruction of property, including, but not limited to, surety bonds, life insurance, health insurance, title insurance, and property and casualty insurance (such as private passenger or commercial automobile, homeowners, mortgage, commercial multiperil, general liability, professional liability, workers&rsquo; compensation, fire and allied lines, farm owners multiperil, aircraft, fidelity, surety, medical malpractice, ocean marine, inland marine, and boiler and machinery insurance); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not a product or service of a bank that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a deposit product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a loan, discount, letter of credit, or other extension of credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a trust or other fiduciary service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) a qualified financial contract (as defined in or determined pursuant to section 1821(e)(8)(D)(i) of title 12); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) a financial guaranty, except that this subparagraph (B) shall not apply to a product that includes an insurance component such that if the product is offered or proposed to be offered by the bank as principal&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it would be treated as a life insurance contract under section 7702 of title 26; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in the event that the product is not a letter of credit or other similar extension of credit, a qualified financial contract, or a financial guaranty, it would qualify for treatment for losses incurred with respect to such product under section 832(b)(5) of title 26, if the bank were subject to tax as an insurance company under section 831 of that title; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any annuity contract, the income on which is subject to tax treatment under section 72 of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, providing insurance (including reinsurance) outside the United States that insures, guarantees, or indemnifies insurance products provided in a State, or that indemnifies an insurance company with regard to insurance products provided in a State, shall be considered to be providing insurance as principal in that State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No national bank may engage in any activity involving the underwriting or sale of title insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nondiscrimination parity exception</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including section 6701 of this title), in the case of any State in which banks organized under the laws of such State are authorized to <!-- PDFPage:1699 -->sell title insurance as agent, a national bank may sell title insurance as agent in such State, but only in the same manner, to the same extent, and under the same restrictions as such State banks are authorized to sell title insurance as agent in such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with &ldquo;wildcard&rdquo; provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State law which authorizes State banks to engage in any activities in such State in which a national bank may engage shall not be treated as a statute which authorizes State banks to sell title insurance as agent, for purposes of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Grandfathering with consistent regulation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) and notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a national bank, and a subsidiary of a national bank, may conduct title insurance activities which such national bank or subsidiary was actively and lawfully conducting before November 12, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Insurance affiliate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a national bank which has an affiliate which provides insurance as principal and is not a subsidiary of the bank, the national bank and any subsidiary of the national bank may not engage in the underwriting of title insurance pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Insurance subsidiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a national bank which has a subsidiary which provides insurance as principal and has no affiliate other than a subsidiary which provides insurance as principal, the national bank may not directly engage in any activity involving the underwriting of title insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Affiliate&rdquo; and &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the terms &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; and &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; have the same meanings as in section 1841 of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this Act or any other Federal law shall be construed as superseding or affecting a State law which was in effect before November 12, 1999, and which prohibits title insurance from being offered, provided, or sold in such State, or from being underwritten with respect to real property in such State, by any person whatsoever.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6716. Interagency consultation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intention of the Congress that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as the umbrella supervisor for financial holding companies, and the State insurance regulators, as the functional regulators of companies engaged in insurance activities, coordinate efforts to supervise companies that control both a depository institution and a company engaged in insurance activities regulated under State law. In particular, Congress believes that the Board and the State insurance regulators should share, on a confidential basis, information relevant to the supervision of companies that control both a depository institution and a company engaged in insurance activities, including information regarding the financial health of the consolidated organization and information regarding transactions and relationships between insurance companies and affiliated depository institutions. The appropriate Federal banking agencies for depository institutions should also share, on a confidential basis, information with the relevant State insurance regulators regarding transactions and relationships between depository institutions and affiliated companies engaged in insurance activities. The purpose of this section is to encourage this coordination and confidential sharing of information, and to thereby improve both the efficiency and the quality of the supervision of financial holding companies and their affiliated depository institutions and companies engaged in insurance activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Examination results and other information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Information of the Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the Board may provide any information of the Board regarding the financial condition, risk management policies, and operations of any financial holding company that controls a company that is engaged in insurance activities and is regulated by such State insurance regulator, and regarding any transaction or relationship between such an insurance company and any affiliated depository institution. The Board may provide any other information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that the Board believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Banking agency information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any information of the agency regarding any transaction or relationship between a depository institution supervised by such Federal banking agency and any affiliated company that is engaged in insurance activities regulated by such State insurance regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any other information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that the agency believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State insurance regulator information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the Board or the appropriate Federal banking agency, a State insurance regulator may provide any examination or other reports, records, or other information to which such insurance regulator may have access with respect to a company which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is engaged in insurance activities and regulated by such insurance regulator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is an affiliate of a depository institution or financial holding company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before making any determination relating to the initial affiliation of, or the continuing affiliation of, a depository institution or financial holding company with a company engaged in insurance activities, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall consult with the appropriate State insurance regulator of such company and take the views of such insurance regulator into account in making such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect on other authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall limit in any respect the authority of the appropriate Federal banking agency with respect to a depository institution or bank holding company or any affiliate thereof under any provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Confidentiality and privilege</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Confidentiality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The appropriate Federal banking agency shall not provide any information or material that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable Federal banking agency regulations, or other applicable law, to a State insurance regulator unless such regulator agrees to maintain the information or material in confidence and to take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by the regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency shall treat as confidential any information or material obtained from a State insurance regulator that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable State regulations, or other applicable law, and take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by the Federal banking agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Privilege</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provision pursuant to this section of information or material by a Federal banking <!-- PDFPage:1701 -->agency or State insurance regulator shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege to which the information or material is otherwise subject.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appropriate Federal banking agency; depository institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms &ldquo;appropriate Federal banking agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;depository institution&rdquo; have the same meanings as in section 1813 of title 12.</p>
