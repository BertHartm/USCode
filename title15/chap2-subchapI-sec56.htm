<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Attorney General fails within 45 days after receipt of such notification to commence, defend, or intervene in, such action;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission may commence, defend, or intervene in, and supervise the litigation of, such action and any appeal of such action in its own name by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), in any civil action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under section 53 of this title (relating to injunctive relief);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) under section 57b of this title (relating to consumer redress);</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall have exclusive authority to commence or defend, and supervise the litigation of, such action and any appeal of such action in its own name by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose, unless the Commission authorizes the Attorney General to do so.

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the Commission makes a written request to the Attorney General, within the 10-day period which begins on the date of the entry of the judgment in any civil action in which the Commission represented itself pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), to represent itself through any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose before the Supreme Court in such action, it may do so, if&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where the Attorney General represents the Commission before the Supreme Court in any civil action in which the Commission represented itself pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), the Attorney General may not agree to any settlement, compromise, or dismissal of such action, or confess error in the Supreme Court with respect to such action, unless the Commission concurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph (with respect to representation before the Supreme Court), the term &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; includes the Solicitor General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If, prior to the expiration of the 45-day period specified in paragraph (1) of this section or a 60-day period specified in paragraph (3), any right of the Commission to commence, defend, or intervene in, any such action or appeal may be extinguished due to any procedural requirement of any court with respect to the time in which any pleadings, notice of appeal, or other acts pertaining to such action or appeal may be taken, the Attorney General shall have one-half of the time required to comply with any such procedural requirement of the court (including any extension of such time granted by the court) for the purpose of commencing, defending, or intervening in the civil action pursuant to paragraph (1) or for the purpose of refusing to appeal or file a petition for writ of certiorari and the written notification or failing to take any action pursuant to paragraph 3(A)(ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission is authorized to expend appropriated funds, upon agreement with the Attorney General, to reimburse the Attorney General for the retention of foreign counsel for litigation in foreign courts and for expenses related to litigation in foreign courts in which the Commission has an interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation on use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection authorizes the payment of claims or judgments from any source other than the permanent and indefinite appropriation authorized by section 1304 of title 31.</p>
