<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6732. Redomestication of mutual insurers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Redomestication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mutual insurer organized under the laws of any State may transfer its domicile to a trans<!-- PDFPage:1943 -->feree domicile as a step in a reorganization in which, pursuant to the laws of the transferee domicile and consistent with the standards in subsection (f) of this section, the mutual insurer becomes a stock insurer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a mutual holding company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Resulting domicile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon complying with the applicable law of the transferee domicile governing transfers of domicile and completion of a transfer pursuant to this section, the mutual insurer shall cease to be a domestic insurer in the transferor domicile and, as a continuation of its corporate existence, shall be a domestic insurer of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Licenses preserved</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of authority, agents&rsquo; appointments and licenses, rates, approvals and other items that a licensed State allows and that are in existence immediately prior to the date that a redomesticating insurer transfers its domicile pursuant to this subchapter shall continue in full force and effect upon transfer, if the insurer remains duly qualified to transact the business of insurance in such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effectiveness of outstanding policies and contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All outstanding insurance policies and annuities contracts of a redomesticating insurer shall remain in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the new domicile of the insurer, unless so ordered by the State insurance regulator of a licensed State, and then only in the case of outstanding policies and contracts whose owners reside in such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Applicable State law may require a redomesticating insurer to file new policy forms with the State insurance regulator of a licensed State on or before the effective date of the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a redomesticating insurer may use existing policy forms with appropriate endorsements to reflect the new domicile of the redomesticating insurer until the new policy forms are approved for use by the State insurance regulator of such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A redomesticating insurer shall give notice of the proposed transfer to the State insurance regulator of each licensed State and shall file promptly any resulting amendments to corporate documents required to be filed by a foreign licensed mutual insurer with the insurance regulator of each such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Procedural requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mutual insurer may redomesticate to another State and reorganize into a mutual holding company pursuant to this section unless the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile determines that the plan of reorganization of the insurer includes the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval by board of directors and policyholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reorganization is approved by at least a majority of the board of directors of the mutual insurer and at least a majority of the policyholders who vote after notice, disclosure of the reorganization and the effects of the transaction on policyholder contractual rights, and reasonable opportunity to vote, in accordance with such notice, disclosure, and voting procedures as are approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Continued voting control by policyholders; review of public stock offering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the consummation of a reorganization, the policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall have the same voting rights with respect to the mutual holding company as they had before the reorganization with respect to the mutual insurer. With respect to an initial public offering of stock, the offering shall be conducted in compliance with applicable securities laws and in a manner approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Award of stock or grant of options to officers and directors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the applicable period provided for under the State law of the transferee domicile following completion of an initial public offering, or for a period of six months if no such applicable period is provided, neither a stock holding company nor the converted insurer shall award any stock options or stock grants to persons who are elected officers or directors of the mutual holding company, the stock holding company, or the converted insurer, except with respect to any such awards or options to which a person is entitled as a policyholder and as approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Policyholder rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon reorganization into a mutual holding company, the contractual rights of the policyholders are preserved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Fair and equitable treatment of policyholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reorganization is approved as fair and equitable to the policyholders by the insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless otherwise permitted by this subchapter, State laws of any transferor domicile that conflict with the purposes and intent of this subchapter are preempted, including but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the activities of, taking any action against, or applying any provision of law or regulation to, any insurer or an affiliate of such insurer because that insurer or any affiliate plans to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1944 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the activities of, taking action against, or applying any provision of law or regulation to, any insured or any insurance licensee or other intermediary because such person has procured insurance from or placed insurance with any insurer or affiliate of such insurer that plans to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this subchapter, but only to the extent that such law would treat such insured licensee or other intermediary differently than if the person procured insurance from, or placed insurance with, an insured licensee or other intermediary which had not redomesticated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any law that has the purpose or effect of terminating, because of the redomestication of a mutual insurer pursuant to this subchapter, any certificate of authority, agent appointment or license, rate approval, or other approval, of any State insurance regulator or other State authority in existence immediately prior to the redomestication in any State other than the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Differential treatment prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State law, regulation, interpretation, or functional equivalent thereof, of a State other than a transferee domicile may treat a redomesticating or redomesticated insurer or any affiliate thereof any differently than an insurer operating in that State that is not a redomesticating or redomesticated insurer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Laws prohibiting operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any licensed State fails to issue, delays the issuance of, or seeks to revoke an original or renewal certificate of authority of a redomesticated insurer promptly following redomestication, except on grounds and in a manner consistent with its past practices regarding the issuance of certificates of authority to foreign insurers that are not redomesticating, then the redomesticating insurer shall be exempt from any State law of the licensed State to the extent that such State law or the operation of such State law would make unlawful, or regulate, directly or indirectly, the operation of the redomesticated insurer, except that such licensed State may require the redomesticated insurer to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) comply with the unfair claim settlement practices law of the licensed State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pay, on a nondiscriminatory basis, applicable premium and other taxes which are levied on licensed insurers or policyholders under the laws of the licensed State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) register with and designate the State insurance regulator as its agent solely for the purpose of receiving service of legal documents or process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) submit to an examination by the State insurance regulator in any licensed State in which the redomesticated insurer is doing business to determine the insurer's financial condition, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile has not begun an examination of the redomesticated insurer and has not scheduled such an examination to begin before the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the redomestication; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any such examination is coordinated to avoid unjustified duplication and repetition;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) comply with a lawful order issued in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a delinquency proceeding commenced by the State insurance regulator of any licensed State if there has been a judicial finding of financial impairment under paragraph (7); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a voluntary dissolution proceeding;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) comply with any State law regarding deceptive, false, or fraudulent acts or practices, except that if the licensed State seeks an injunction regarding the conduct described in this paragraph, such injunction must be obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction as provided in section 6734(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) comply with an injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a petition by the State insurance regulator alleging that the redomesticating insurer is in hazardous financial condition or is financially impaired;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) participate in any insurance insolvency guaranty association on the same basis as any other insurer licensed in the licensed State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) require a person acting, or offering to act, as an insurance licensee for a redomesticated insurer in the licensed State to obtain a license from that State, except that such State may not impose any qualification or requirement that discriminates against a nonresident insurance licensee.</p>
