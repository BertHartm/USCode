<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions affecting approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the requirements of subsection (f) of this section are satisfied, the Commission shall approve the acquisition unless the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in case of the acquisition of securities or utility assets, the consideration, including all fees, commissions, and other remuneration, to whomsoever paid, to be given, directly or indirectly, in connection with such acquisition is not reasonable or does not bear a fair relation to the sums invested in or the earning capacity of the utility assets to be acquired or the utility assets underlying the securities to be acquired; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such acquisition will unduly complicate the capital structure of the holding-company system of the applicant or will be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers or the proper functioning of such holding-company system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission may condition its approval of the acquisition of securities of another company upon such a fair offer to purchase such of the other securities of the company whose security is to be acquired as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall not approve&mdash;</p>

This paragraph shall not apply to the acquisition of securities or utility assets of a public-utility company operating exclusively outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Approval to be granted in reasonable time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within such reasonable time after the filing of an application under this section as the Commission shall fix by rules and regulations or order, the Commission shall enter an order either granting or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying approval of the acquisition unless the applicant shall withdraw its application. Amendments to an application may be made upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:318 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Terms and conditions of order granting approval</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Compliance with State laws as condition of approval</h4>
