<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Seller financing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Seller-provided financing may be used to meet the requirements of subparagraph (B), if the seller subordinates the interest of the seller in the property to the debenture guaranteed by the Administration.</p>
