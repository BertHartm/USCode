<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The representation or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of any person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment, or sale of any property or wages of any person unless such action is lawful and the debt collector or creditor intends to take such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The false representation or implication that a sale, referral, or other transfer of any interest in a debt shall cause the consumer to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The false representation or implication that documents are not legal process forms or do not require action by the consumer.</p>
