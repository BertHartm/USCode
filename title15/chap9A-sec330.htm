<h4 class="note-head">National Weather Modification Policy Act of 1976</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 94&ndash;490, &sect;&sect;1&ndash;6(a), Oct. 13, 1976, 90 Stat. 2359&ndash;2361, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body-block">&ldquo;[<cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1]. That this Act may be cited as the National Weather Modification Policy Act of 1976.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <cap-smallcap>Declaration of Policy.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Weather-related disasters and hazards, including drought, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, lightning, fog, floods, and frost, result in substantial human suffering and loss of life, billions of dollars of annual economic losses to owners of crops and other property, and substantial financial loss to the United States Treasury;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Weather modification technology has significant potential for preventing, diverting, moderating, or ameliorating the adverse effects of such disasters and hazards and enhancing crop production and the availability of water;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The interstate nature of climatic and related phenomena, the severe economic hardships experienced as the result of occasional drought and other adverse meteorological conditions, and the existing role and responsibilities of the Federal Government <!-- PDFPage:645 -->with respect to disaster relief, require appropriate Federal action to prevent or alleviate such disasters and hazards; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Weather modification programs may have long-range and unexpected effects on existing climatic patterns which are not confined by national boundaries.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in this Act to develop a comprehensive and coordinated national weather modification policy and a national program of weather modification research and development&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to determine the means by which deliberate weather modification can be used at the present time to decrease the adverse impact of weather on agriculture, economic growth, and the general public welfare, and to determine the potential for weather modification;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to conduct research into those scientific areas considered most likely to lead to practical techniques for drought prevention or alleviation and other forms of deliberate weather modification;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to develop practical methods and devices for weather modification;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to make weather modification research findings available to interested parties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to assess the economic, social, environmental, and legal impact of an operational weather modification program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to develop both national and international mechanisms designed to minimize conflicts which may arise with respect to the peaceful uses of weather modification; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to integrate the results of existing experience and studies in weather modification activities into model codes and agreements for regulation of domestic and international weather modification activities.</p>
