<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1631. Disclosure requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Duty of creditor or lessor respecting one or more than one obligor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a creditor or lessor shall disclose to the person who is obligated on a consumer lease or a consumer credit transaction the information required under this subchapter. In a transaction involving more than one obligor, a creditor or lessor, except in a transaction under section 1635 of this title, need not disclose to more than one of such obligors if the obligor given disclosure is a primary obligor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Creditor or lessor required to make disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a transaction involves one creditor as defined in section 1602(f) of this title, or one lessor as defined in section 1667(3) of this title, such creditor or lessor shall make the disclosures. If a transaction involves more than one creditor or lessor, only one creditor or lessor shall by required to make the disclosures. The Board shall by regulation specify which creditor or lessor shall make the disclosures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Estimates as satisfying statutory requirements; basis of disclosure for per diem interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may provide by regulation that any portion of the information required to be disclosed by this subchapter may be given in the form of estimates where the provider of such information is not in a position to know exact information. In the case of any consumer credit transaction a portion of the interest on which is determined on a per diem basis and is to be collected upon the consummation of such transaction, any disclosure with respect to such portion of interest shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of this subchapter if the disclosure is based on information actually known to the creditor at the time that the disclosure documents are being prepared for the consummation of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tolerances for numerical disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall determine whether tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate are necessary to facilitate compliance with this subchapter, and if it determines that such tolerances are necessary to facilitate compliance, it shall by regulation permit disclosures within such tolerances. The Board shall exercise its authority to permit tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate so that such tolerances are narrow enough to prevent such tolerances from resulting in misleading disclosures or disclosures that circumvent the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1635. Right of rescission as to certain transactions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disclosure of obligor's right to rescind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the case of any consumer credit transaction (including opening or increasing the credit limit for an open end credit plan) in which a security interest, including any such interest arising by operation of law, is or will be retained or acquired in any property which is used as the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, the obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter, whichever is later, by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Board, of his intention to do so. The creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the Board, to any obligor in a transaction subject to this section the rights of the obligor under this section. The creditor shall also provide, in accordance with regulations of the Board, appropriate forms for the obligor to exercise his right to rescind any transaction subject to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Return of money or property following rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When an obligor exercises his right to rescind under subsection (a) of this section, he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission. Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the boligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it. Upon the performance of the creditor's obligations under this section, the obligor shall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the obligor shall tender its reasonable value. Tender shall be made at the location of the property or at the residence of the obligor, at the option of the obligor. If the creditor does not take possession of the property within 20 days after tender by the obligor, ownership of the property vests in the obligor without obligation on his part to pay for it. The procedures prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when otherwise ordered by a court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rebuttable presumption of delivery of required disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any rule of evidence, written acknowledgment of receipt of any disclosures required under this subchapter by a person to whom information, forms, and a statement is required to be given pursuant to this section does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Modification and waiver of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may, if it finds that such action is necessary in order to permit homeowners to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies, prescribe regulations authorizing the modifica<!-- PDFPage:1148 -->tion or waiver of any rights created under this section to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in those regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exempted transactions; reapplication of provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a residential mortgage transaction as defined in section 1602(w) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a transaction which constitutes a refinancing or consolidation (with no new advances) of the principal balance then due and any accrued and unpaid finance charges of an existing extension of credit by the same creditor secured by an interest in the same property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a transaction in which an agency of a State is the creditor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) advances under a preexisting open end credit plan if a security interest has already been retained or acquired and such advances are in accordance with a previously established credit limit for such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Time limit for exercise of right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever occurs first, notwithstanding the fact that the information and forms required under this section or any other disclosures required under this part have not been delivered to the obligor, except that if (1) any agency empowered to enforce the provisions of this subchapter institutes a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section within three years after the date of consummation of the transaction, (2) such agency finds a violation of this section, and (3) the obligor's right to rescind is based in whole or in part on any matter involved in such proceeding, then the obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the earlier sale of the property, or upon the expiration of one year following the conclusion of the proceeding, or any judicial review or period for judicial review thereof, whichever is later.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Required disclosures by creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before opening any account under an open end consumer credit plan, the creditor shall disclose to the person to whom credit is to be extended each of the following items, to the extent applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The conditions under which a finance charge may be imposed, including the time period (if any) within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge, except that the creditor may, at his election and without disclosure, impose no such finance charge if payment is received after the termination of such time period. If no such time period is provided, the creditor shall disclose such fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The method of determining the balance upon which a finance charge will be imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The method of determining the amount of the finance charge, including any minimum or fixed amount imposed as a finance charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Where one or more periodic rates may be used to compute the finance charge, each such rate, the range of balances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding nominal annual percentage rate determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of periods in a year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Identification of other charges which may be imposed as part of the plan, and their method of computation, in accordance with regulations of the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In cases where the credit is or will be secured, a statement that a security interest has been or will be taken in (A) the property purchased as part of the credit transaction, or (B) property not purchased as part of the credit transaction identified by item or type.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A statement, in a form prescribed by regulations of the Board of the protection provided by sections 1666 and 1666i of this title to an obligor and the creditor's responsibilities under sections 1666a and 1666i of this title. With respect to one billing cycle per calendar year, at intervals of not less than six months or more than eighteen months, the creditor shall transmit such statement to each obligor to whom the creditor is required to transmit a statement pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for such billing cycle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) In the case of any account under an open end consumer credit plan which provides for any extension of credit which is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, any information which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is required to be disclosed under section 1637a(a) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Board determines is not described in any other paragraph of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement required with each billing cycle</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The creditor of any account under an open end consumer credit plan shall transmit to the obligor, for each billing cycle at the end of which there is an outstanding balance in that account or with respect to which a finance charge is imposed, a statement setting forth each of the following items to the extent applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The outstanding balance in the account at the beginning of the statement period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount and date of each extension of credit during the period, and a brief identification, on or accompanying the statement of each extension of credit in a form prescribed by the Board sufficient to enable the obligor either to identify the transaction or to relate it to copies of sales vouchers or similar instruments previously furnished, except that a creditor's failure to disclose such information <!-- PDFPage:1150 -->in accordance with this paragraph shall not be deemed a failure to comply with this part or this subchapter if (A) the creditor maintains procedures reasonably adapted to procure and provide such information, and (B) the creditor responds to and treats any inquiry for clarification or documentation as a billing error and an erroneously billed amount under section 1666 of this title. In lieu of complying with the requirements of the previous sentence, in the case of any transaction in which the creditor and seller are the same person, as defined by the Board, and such person's open end credit plan has fewer than 15,000 accounts, the creditor may elect to provide only the amount and date of each extension of credit during the period and the seller's name and location where the transaction took place if (A) a brief identification of the transaction has been previously furnished, and (B) the creditor responds to and treats any inquiry for clarification or documentation as a billing error and an erroneously billed amount under section 1666 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The total amount credited to the account during the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The amount of any finance charge added to the account during the period, itemized to show the amounts, if any, due to the application of percentage rates and the amount, if any, imposed as a minimum or fixed charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Where one or more periodic rates may be used to compute the finance charge, each such rate, the range of balances to which it is applicable, and, unless the annual percentage rate (determined under section 1606(a)(2) of this title) is required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (6), the corresponding nominal annual percentage rate determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of periods in a year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Where the total finance charge exceeds 50 cents for a monthly or longer billing cycle, or the pro rata part of 50 cents for a billing cycle shorter than monthly, the total finance charge expressed as an annual percentage rate (determined under section 1606(a)(2) of this title), except that if the finance charge is the sum of two or more products of a rate times a portion of the balance, the creditor may, in lieu of disclosing a single rate for the total charge, disclose each such rate expressed as an annual percentage rate, and the part of the balance to which it is applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The balance on which the finance charge was computed and a statement of how the balance was determined. If the balance is determined without first deducting all credits during the period, that fact and the amount of such payments shall also be disclosed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The outstanding balance in the account at the end of the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The date by which or the period (if any) within which, payment must be made to avoid additional finance charges, except that the creditor may, at his election and without disclosure, impose no such additional finance charge if payment is received after such date or the termination of such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The address to be used by the creditor for the purpose of receiving billing inquiries from the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11)(A) A written statement in the following form: &ldquo;Minimum Payment Warning: Making only the minimum payment will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance.&rdquo;, or such similar statement as is established by the Board pursuant to consumer testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Repayment information that would apply to the outstanding balance of the consumer under the credit plan, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the number of months (rounded to the nearest month) that it would take to pay the entire amount of that balance, if the consumer pays only the required minimum monthly payments and if no further advances are made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the total cost to the consumer, including interest and principal payments, of paying that balance in full, if the consumer pays only the required minimum monthly payments and if no further advances are made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the monthly payment amount that would be required for the consumer to eliminate the outstanding balance in 36 months, if no further advances are made, and the total cost to the consumer, including interest and principal payments, of paying that balance in full if the consumer pays the balance over 36 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) a toll-free telephone number at which the consumer may receive information about accessing credit counseling and debt management services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), in making the disclosures under subparagraph (B), the creditor shall apply the interest rate or rates in effect on the date on which the disclosure is made until the date on which the balance would be paid in full.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If the interest rate in effect on the date on which the disclosure is made is a temporary rate that will change under a contractual provision applying an index or formula for subsequent interest rate adjustment, the creditor shall apply the interest rate in effect on the date on which the disclosure is made for as long as that interest rate will apply under that contractual provision, and then apply an interest rate based on the index or formula in effect on the applicable billing date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) All of the information described in subparagraph (B) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be disclosed in the form and manner which the Board shall prescribe, by regulation, and in a manner that avoids duplication; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) be placed in a conspicuous and prominent location on the billing statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the regulations prescribed under subparagraph (D), the Board shall require that the disclosure of such information shall be in the form of a table that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) contains clear and concise headings for each item of such information; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provides a clear and concise form stating each item of information required to be disclosed under each such heading.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1151 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) In prescribing the form of the table under subparagraph (E), the Board shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all of the information in the table, and not just a reference to the table, be placed on the billing statement, as required by this paragraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the items required to be included in the table shall be listed in the order in which such items are set forth in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) In prescribing the form of the table under subparagraph (D), the Board shall employ terminology which is different than the terminology which is employed in subparagraph (B), if such terminology is more easily understood and conveys substantially the same meaning.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) <cap-smallcap>Requirements relating to late payment deadlines and penalties.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Late payment deadline required to be disclosed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan under which a late fee or charge may be imposed due to the failure of the obligor to make payment on or before the due date for such payment, the periodic statement required under subsection (b) with respect to the account shall include, in a conspicuous location on the billing statement, the date on which the payment is due or, if different, the date on which a late payment fee will be charged, together with the amount of the fee or charge to be imposed if payment is made after that date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Payments at local branches</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the creditor, in the case of a credit card account referred to in subparagraph (A), is a financial institution which maintains branches or offices at which payments on any such account are accepted from the obligor in person, the date on which the obligor makes a payment on the account at such branch or office shall be considered to be the date on which the payment is made for purposes of determining whether a late fee or charge may be imposed due to the failure of the obligor to make payment on or before the due date for such payment.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disclosures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Specific disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to other disclosures required under this subchapter, for each mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title, the creditor shall provide the following disclosures in conspicuous type size:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) &ldquo;You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) &ldquo;If you obtain this loan, the lender will have a mortgage on your home. You could lose your home, and any money you have put into it, if you do not meet your obligations under the loan.&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual percentage rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the disclosures required under paragraph (1), the creditor shall disclose&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a credit transaction with a fixed rate of interest, the annual percentage rate and the amount of the regular monthly payment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any other credit transaction, the annual percentage rate of the loan, the amount of the regular monthly payment, a statement that the interest rate and monthly payment may increase, and the amount of the maximum monthly payment, based on the maximum interest rate allowed pursuant to section 3806 of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time of disclosures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The disclosures required by this section shall be given not less than 3 business days prior to consummation of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) New disclosures required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After providing the disclosures required by this section, a creditor may not change the terms of the extension of credit if such changes make the disclosures inaccurate, unless new disclosures are provided that meet the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Telephone disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A creditor may provide new disclosures pursuant to subparagraph (A) by telephone, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the change is initiated by the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) at the consummation of the transaction under which the credit is extended&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the creditor provides to the consumer the new disclosures, in writing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the creditor and consumer certify in writing that the new disclosures were provided by telephone, by not later than 3 days prior to the date of consummation of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may, if it finds that such action is necessary to permit homeowners to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies, prescribe regulations authorizing the modification or waiver of rights created under this subsection, to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in those regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) No Prepayment penalty</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limitation on terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title may not contain terms under which a consumer must pay a prepayment penalty for paying all or part of the principal before the date on which the principal is due.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, any method of computing a refund of unearned scheduled interest is a prepayment penalty if it is less favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method (as that term is defined in section 1615(d) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title may contain a prepayment penalty (including terms calculating a refund by a method that is not prohibited under section 1615(b) of this title for the transaction in question) if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1171 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at the time the mortgage is consummated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the consumer is not liable for an amount of monthly indebtedness payments (including the amount of credit extended or to be extended under the transaction) that is greater than 50 percent of the monthly gross income of the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the income and expenses of the consumer are verified by a financial statement signed by the consumer, by a credit report, and in the case of employment income, by payment records or by verification from the employer of the consumer (which verification may be in the form of a copy of a pay stub or other payment record supplied by the consumer);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the penalty applies only to a prepayment made with amounts obtained by the consumer by means other than a refinancing by the creditor under the mortgage, or an affiliate of that creditor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the penalty does not apply after the end of the 5-year period beginning on the date on which the mortgage is consummated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the penalty is not prohibited under other applicable law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitations after default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title may not provide for an interest rate applicable after default that is higher than the interest rate that applies before default. If the date of maturity of a mortgage referred to in subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> 1602(aa) of this title is accelerated due to default and the consumer is entitled to a rebate of interest, that rebate shall be computed by any method that is not less favorable than the actuarial method (as that term is defined in section 1615(d) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) No balloon payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title having a term of less than 5 years may not include terms under which the aggregate amount of the regular periodic payments would not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) No negative amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title may not include terms under which the outstanding principal balance will increase at any time over the course of the loan because the regular periodic payments do not cover the full amount of interest due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) No prepaid payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title may not include terms under which more than 2 periodic payments required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prohibition on extending credit without regard to payment ability of consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor shall not engage in a pattern or practice of extending credit to consumers under mortgages referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title based on the consumers&rsquo; collateral without regard to the consumers&rsquo; repayment ability, including the consumers&rsquo; current and expected income, current obligations, and employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Requirements for payments under home improvement contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor shall not make a payment to a contractor under a home improvement contract from amounts extended as credit under a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title, other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the form of an instrument that is payable to the consumer or jointly to the consumer and the contractor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at the election of the consumer, by a third party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the consumer, the creditor, and the contractor before the date of payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Consequence of failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage that contains a provision prohibited by this section shall be deemed a failure to deliver the material disclosures required under this subchapter, for the purpose of section 1635 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) &ldquo;Affiliate&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 1841(k) of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Discretionary regulatory authority of Board</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may, by regulation or order, exempt specific mortgage products or categories of mortgages from any or all of the prohibitions specified in subsections (c) through (i) of this section, if the Board finds that the exemption&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is in the interest of the borrowing public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen home ownership and equity protection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board, by regulation or order, shall prohibit acts or practices in connection with&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) refinancing of mortgage loans that the Board finds to be associated with abusive lending practices, or that are otherwise not in the interest of the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Civil penalties in Federal Trade Commission enforcement actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, any violation of a regulation issued by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to subsection (<em>l</em>)(2) of this section shall be treated as a violation of a rule promulgated under section 57a of this title regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The mortgagor occupies the property securing the mortgage as his or her principal residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The servicer reasonably determined, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee, that the application of such qualified loss mitigation plan to a mortgage or class of mortgages will likely provide an anticipated recovery on the outstanding principal mortgage debt that will exceed the anticipated recovery through foreclosures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) No liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A servicer that is deemed to be acting in the best interests of all investors or other parties under this section shall not be liable to any party who is owed a duty under subsection (a)(1), and shall not be subject to any injunction, stay, or other equitable relief to such party, based solely upon the implementation by the servicer of a qualified loss mitigation plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any person, including a trustee, issuer, and loan originator, shall not be liable for monetary damages or be subject to an injunction, stay, or other equitable relief, based solely upon the cooperation of such person with a servicer when such cooperation is necessary for the servicer to implement a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each servicer that engages in qualified loss mitigation plans under this section shall regularly report to the Secretary of the Treasury the extent, scope, and results of the servicer's modification activities.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Individual or class action for damages; amount of award; factors determining amount of award</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, any creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this part, including any requirement under section 1635 of this title, subsection (f) or (g) of section 1641 of this title, or part D or E of this subchapter with respect to any person is liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any actual damage sustained by such person as a result of the failure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A)(i) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, (ii) in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease under part E of this subchapter, 25 per centum of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease, except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, (iii) in the case of an individual action relating to an open end consumer credit plan that is not secured by real property or a dwelling, twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, with a minimum of $500 and a maximum of $5,000, or such higher amount as may be appropriate in the case of an established pattern or practice of such failures;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1640_1_target" name="1640_1">1</a></sup> or (iv) in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $400 or greater than $4,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a class action, such amount as the court may allow, except that as to each member of the class no minimum recovery shall be applicable, and the total recovery under this subparagraph in any class action or series of class actions arising out of the same failure to comply by the same creditor shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any successful action to enforce the foregoing liability or in any action in which a person is determined to have a right of rescission under section 1635 or 1638(e)(7) of this title, the costs of the action, together with a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of a failure to comply with any requirement under section 1639 of this title, an amount equal to the sum of all finance charges and fees paid by the consumer, unless the creditor demonstrates that the failure to comply is not material.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining the amount of award in any class action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors, the amount of any actual damages awarded, the frequency and persistence of failures of compliance by the creditor, the resources of the creditor, the number of persons adversely affected, and the extent to which the creditor's failure of compliance was intentional. In connection with the disclosures referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of section 1637 of this title, a creditor shall have a liability determined under paragraph (2) only for failing to comply with the requirements of section 1635 of this title, 1637(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1640_2_target" name="1640_2">2</a></sup> of this title, or any of paragraphs (4) through (13) of section 1637(b) of this title, or for failing to comply with disclosure requirements under State law for any term or item that the Board has determined to be substantially the same in meaning under section 1610(a)(2) of this title as any of the terms or items referred to in section 1637(a) of this title, or any of paragraphs (4) through (13) of section 1637(b) of this title. In connection with the disclosures referred to in subsection (c) or (d) of section 1637 of this title, a card issuer shall have a liability under this section only to a cardholder who pays a fee described in section 1637(c)(1)(A)(ii)(I) or section 1637(c)(4)(A)(i) of this title or who uses the credit card or charge card. In connection with the disclosures referred to in section 1638 of this title, a creditor shall have a liability determined under paragraph (2) only for failing to comply with the requirements of section 1635 of this title, of paragraph (2) (insofar as it requires a disclosure of the &ldquo;amount financed&rdquo;), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (9) of section 1638(a) of this title, or sec<!-- PDFPage:1174 -->tion 1638(b)(2)(C)(ii) of this title, of subparagraphs (A), (B), (D), (F), or (J) of section 1638(e)(2) of this title (for purposes of paragraph (2) or (4) of section 1638(e) of this title), or paragraph (4)(C), (6), (7), or (8) of section 1638(e) of this title, or for failing to comply with disclosure requirements under State law for any term which the Board has determined to be substantially the same in meaning under section 1610(a)(2) of this title as any of the terms referred to in any of those paragraphs of section 1638(a) of this title or section 1638(b)(2)(C)(ii) of this title. With respect to any failure to make disclosures required under this part or part D or E of this subchapter, liability shall be imposed only upon the creditor required to make disclosure, except as provided in section 1641 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Correction of errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor or assignee has no liability under this section or section 1607 of this title or section 1611 of this title for any failure to comply with any requirement imposed under this part or part E of this subchapter, if within sixty days after discovering an error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or notice issued under section 1607(e)(1) of this title or through the creditor's or assignee's own procedures, and prior to the institution of an action under this section or the receipt of written notice of the error from the obligor, the creditor or assignee notifies the person concerned of the error and makes whatever adjustments in the appropriate account are necessary to assure that the person will not be required to pay an amount in excess of the charge actually disclosed, or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unintentional violations; bona fide errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor or assignee may not be held liable in any action brought under this section or section 1635 of this title for a violation of this subchapter if the creditor or assignee shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error. Examples of a bona fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programing, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to a person's obligations under this subchapter is not a bona fide error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Liability in transaction or lease involving multiple obligors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When there are multiple obligors in a consumer credit transaction or consumer lease, there shall be no more than one recovery of damages under subsection (a)(2) of this section for a violation of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Jurisdiction of courts; limitations on actions; State attorney general enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any action under this section may be brought in any United States district court, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation or, in the case of a violation involving a private education loan (as that term is defined in section 1650(a) of this title), 1 year from the date on which the first regular payment of principal is due under the loan. This subsection does not bar a person from asserting a violation of this subchapter in an action to collect the debt which was brought more than one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation as a matter of defense by recoupment or set-off in such action, except as otherwise provided by State law. An action to enforce a violation of section 1639 of this title may also be brought by the appropriate State attorney general in any appropriate United States district court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, not later than 3 years after the date on which the violation occurs. The State attorney general shall provide prior written notice of any such civil action to the Federal agency responsible for enforcement under section 1607 of this title and shall provide the agency with a copy of the complaint. If prior notice is not feasible, the State attorney general shall provide notice to such agency immediately upon instituting the action. The Federal agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) intervene in the action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon intervening&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) remove the action to the appropriate United States district court, if it was not originally brought there; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be heard on all matters arising in the action; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) file a petition for appeal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Good faith compliance with rule, regulation, or interpretation of Board or with interpretation or approval of duly authorized official or employee of Federal Reserve System</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section, section 1607(b) of this title, section 1607(c) of this title, section 1607(e) of this title, or section 1611 of this title imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Board or in conformity with any interpretation or approval by an official or employee of the Federal Reserve System duly authorized by the Board to issue such interpretations or approvals under such procedures as the Board may prescribe therefor, notwithstanding that after such act or omission has occurred, such rule, regulation, interpretation, or approval is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Recovery for multiple failures to disclose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The multiple failure to disclose to any person any information required under this part or part D or E of this subchapter to be disclosed in connection with a single account under an open end consumer credit plan, other single consumer credit sale, consumer loan, consumer lease, or other extension of consumer credit, shall entitle the person to a single recovery under this section but continued failure to disclose after a recovery has been granted shall give rise to rights to additional recoveries. This subsection does not bar any remedy permitted by section 1635 of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1175 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Offset from amount owed to creditor or assignee; rights of defaulting consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person may not take any action to offset any amount for which a creditor or assignee is potentially liable to such person under subsection (a)(2) of this section against any amount owed by such person, unless the amount of the creditor's or assignee's liability under this subchapter has been determined by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action of which such person was a party. This subsection does not bar a consumer then in default on the obligation from asserting a violation of this subchapter as an original action, or as a defense or counterclaim to an action to collect amounts owed by the consumer brought by a person liable under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Class action moratorium</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period beginning on May 18, 1995, and ending on October 1, 1995, no court may enter any order certifying any class in any action under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is brought in connection with any credit transaction not under an open end credit plan which is secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling and constitutes a refinancing or consolidation of an existing extension of credit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is based on the alleged failure of a creditor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to include a charge actually incurred (in connection with the transaction) in the finance charge disclosed pursuant to section 1638 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to properly make any other disclosure required under section 1638 of this title as a result of the failure described in clause (i); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to provide proper notice of rescission rights under section 1635(a) of this title due to the selection by the creditor of the incorrect form from among the model forms prescribed by the Board or from among forms based on such model forms.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions for certain alleged violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to any action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) described in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(B), if the amount disclosed as the finance charge results in an annual percentage rate that exceeds the tolerance provided in section 1606(c) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) described in paragraph (1)(B)(iii), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no notice relating to rescission rights under section 1635(a) of this title was provided in any form; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) proper notice was not provided for any reason other than the reason described in such paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Private educational lender</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A private educational lender (as that term is defined in section 1650(a) of this title) has no liability under this section for failure to comply with section 1638(e)(3) of this title).<sup><a href="#1640_3_target" name="1640_3">3</a></sup></p>

For the purpose of this section, a violation apparent on the face of the disclosure statement includes, but is not limited to (1) a disclosure which can be determined to be incomplete or inaccurate from the face of the disclosure statement or other documents assigned, or (2) a disclosure which does not use the terms required to be used by this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proof of compliance with statutory provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 1635(c) of this title, in any action or proceeding by or against any subsequent assignee of the original creditor without knowledge to the contrary by the assignee when he acquires the obligation, written acknowledgement of receipt by a person to whom a statement is required to be given pursuant to this subchapter shall be conclusive proof of the delivery thereof and, except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, of compliance with this part.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Right of rescission by consumer unaffected</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person who purchases or is otherwise assigned a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title shall be subject to all claims and defenses with respect to that mortgage that the consumer could assert against the creditor of the mortgage, unless the purchaser or assignee demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a reasonable person exercising ordinary due diligence, could not determine, based on the documentation required by this subchapter, the itemization of the amount financed, and other disclosure of disbursements that the mortgage was a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title. The preceding sentence does not affect rights of a consumer under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section or any other provision of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, relief provided as a result of any action made permissible by paragraph (1) may not exceed&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement provided in connection with such transaction pursuant to this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the assignment to the assignee was voluntary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Violation apparent on the face of the disclosure described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of this section, a violation is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A servicer of a consumer obligation arising from a consumer credit transaction shall not be treated as the owner of the obligation for purposes of this section on the basis of an assignment of the obligation from the creditor or another assignee to the servicer solely for the administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the obligation. Upon written request by the obligor, the servicer shall provide the obligor, to the best knowledge of the servicer, with the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the obligation or the master servicer of the obligation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Servicer&rdquo; defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the unauthorized use occurs before the card issuer has been notified that an unauthorized use of the credit card has occurred or may occur as the result of loss, theft, or otherwise; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Burden of proof</h4>
