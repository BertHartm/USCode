Any suit against the Corporation shall be brought in the District of Columbia, or in the district wherein the plaintiff resides or is engaged in business. No suit by or against the Corporation shall be allowed unless (1) it shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued on which suit is brought, or (2) in the event that the person bringing such suit shall have been under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the right accrued, the suit shall have been brought within three years after the disability shall have ceased or within six years after the right accrued on which suit is brought, whichever period is longer. The defendant in any suit by or against the Corporation may plead, by way of set-off or counterclaim, any cause of action, whether arising out of the same transaction or not, which would otherwise be barred by such limitation if the claim upon <!-- PDFPage:843 -->which the defendant's cause of action is based had not been barred prior to the date that the plaintiff's cause of action arose: <em>Provided</em>, That the defendant shall not be awarded a judgment on any such set-off or counterclaim for any amount in excess of the amount of the plaintiff's claim established in the suit. All suits against the Corporation shall be tried by the court without a jury. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Federal Tort Claims Act (Public Law 601, Seventy-ninth Congres&nbsp;<sup><a href="#714b_1_target" name="714b_1">1</a></sup> [28 U.S.C. 1346(b) and 2671 et seq.] shall be applicable to the Corporation. Any suit by or against the United States as the real party in interest based upon any claim by or against the Corporation shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section to the same extent as though such suit were by or against the Corporation, except that (1) any such suit against the United States based upon any claim of the type enumerated in section 1491 of title 28, may be brought in the United States Court of Federal Claims, and (2) no such suit against the United States may be brought in a district court unless such suit might, without regard to the provisions of this subchapter, be brought in such court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) May contract for the use, in accordance with the usual customs of trade and commerce, of plants and facilities for the physical handling, storage, processing, servicing, and transportation of the agricultural commodities subject to its control. The Corporation shall not have power to acquire real property or any interest therein except that it may (a) rent or lease office space necessary for the conduct of its business and (b) acquire real property or any interest therein for the purpose of providing storage adequate to carry out effectively and efficiently any of the Corporation's programs, or of securing or discharging obligations owing to the Corporation, or of otherwise protecting the financial interests of the Corporation: <em>Provided</em>, That the authority contained in this subsection shall not be utilized by the Corporation for the purpose of acquiring real property, or any interest therein, in order to provide storage facilities for any commodity unless the Corporation determines that existing privately owned storage facilities for such commodity in the area concerned are not adequate: <em>Provided further</em>, That no refrigerated cold storage facilities shall be constructed or purchased except with funds specifically provided by Congress for that purpose: <em>And provided further</em>, That any contract entered into by the Corporation for the use of a storage facility shall provide at least that (1) the rental rate charged for an extended term in excess of one year shall be at an annual rate less than that which is charged for a one-year contract, (2) any obligation of the Corporation to pay for the use of any space in a facility shall be relieved to the extent that the Corporation does not use the space and payment is made by another person for the use of such space, and (3) if the Corporation determines that it no longer needs the space reserved in the facility, the Corporation may be relieved, for the remaining term of the contract, of its obligations to an extent and in a manner that will provide significant savings to the Corporation while permitting the owner of the facility reasonable time to lease such space to another person: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing contained in this subsection shall limit the duty of the Corporation, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the fulfillment of the Corporation's purposes and the effective and efficient conduct of its business, to utilize the usual and customary channels, facilities, and arrangements of trade and commerce in the warehousing of commodities: <em>And provided further</em>, That to encourage the storage of grain on farms, where it can be stored at the lowest cost, the Corporation may make loans to grain growers needing storage facilities when such growers shall apply to the Corporation for financing the construction or purchase of suitable storage, and these loans shall be deducted from the proceeds of price support loans or purchase agreements made between the Corporation and the growers, except that the Secretary shall make such loans in areas in which the Secretary determines that there is a deficiency of such storage. To encourage the alleviation of natural resource conservation problems that reduce the productive capacity of the Nation's land and water resources or that cause degradation of environmental quality, the Corporation may, beginning December 22, 1981, make loans to any agricultural producer for those natural resource conservation and environmental enhancement measures that are recommended by the applicable county and <!-- PDFPage:844 -->State committees established under section 590h(b) of title 16 and are included in the producer's conservation plan approved by the local soil and water conservation district; such loans shall be for a period not to exceed ten years at a rate of interest based upon the rate of interest charged the Corporation by the United States Treasury; the Corporation may make loans to any one producer in any fiscal year in an amount not to exceed $25,000; loans up to $10,000 in amount may be unsecured and loans in excess of $10,000 shall be secured; and the total of such unsecured and secured loans made in each fiscal year shall not exceed $200,000,000: <em>Provided</em>, That the authority provided by this sentence to make loans shall be effective only to the extent and in such amounts as may be provided for in prior appropriation Acts. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable, in consultation with the Secretary of State, and upon terms and conditions prescribed or approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, accept strategic and critical materials produced abroad in exchange for agricultural commodities acquired by the Corporation. Insofar as practicable, in effecting such exchange of goods, the Secretary shall: (1) use normal commercial trade channels; (2) take action to avoid displacing usual marketings of United States agricultural commodities and the products thereof; (3) take reasonable precautions to prevent the resale or transshipment to other countries, or use for other than domestic use in the importing country, of agricultural commodities used for such exchange; and (4) give priority to commodities easily storable and those which serve as prime incentive goods to stimulate production of critical and strategic materials. The Corporation may solicit bids from, and utilize, private trading firms to effect such exchange of goods. The determination of the quantities and qualities of such materials which are desirable for stock piling and the determination of which materials are strategic and critical shall be made in the manner prescribed by section 3 of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act [50 U.S.C. 98b]. Strategic and critical materials acquired by Commodity Credit Corporation in exchange for agricultural commodities shall, to the extent approved by the President, be transferred to the stock pile provided for by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act [50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.]; and in the same fiscal year such materials are transferred to the stock pile the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be reimbursed for the strategic and critical materials so transferred to the stock pile from the funds made available for the purpose of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, in an amount equal to the fair market value, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the material transferred to the stock pile. If the volume of petroleum products (including crude oil) stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is less than the level prescribed under section 6234 of title 42, the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable and with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, make available annually to the Secretary of Energy, upon the request of the Secretary of Energy, a quantity of agricultural products owned by the Corporation with a market value at the time of such request of at least $300,000,000 for use by the Secretary of Energy in acquiring petroleum products (including crude oil) produced abroad for placement in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through an exchange of such agricultural products. The terms and conditions of each such exchange, including provisions for full reimbursement to the Commodity Credit Corporation, shall be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture. Nothing contained herein shall limit the authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation to acquire, hold, or dispose of such quantity of strategic and critical materials as it deems advisable in carrying out its functions and protecting its assets: <em>Provided</em>, That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, where a grain storage facility owned by the Corporation is not needed by the Corporation and, upon being offered for sale no person offers to pay the minimum price set by the Corporation for such facility for use in connection with storage or handling of agricultural commodities, then the Corporation may, without declaring such facility to be excess property, sell it by bids at not less than such minimum price to any public or private nonprofit agency or organization for use for the purposes of such agency or organization. This provision shall apply also to facilities which on the effective date of this Act have been declared excess to the needs of the Commodity Credit Corporation but have not been claimed by any other Government agency, or surplus to the needs of the Government but not disposed of pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) May borrow money subject to any provision of law applicable to the Corporation: <em>Provided</em>, That the total of all money borrowed by the Corporation, other than trust deposits and advances received on sales, shall not at any time exceed in the aggregate $30,000,000,000. The Corporation shall at all times reserve a sufficient amount of its authorized borrowing power which, together with other funds available to the Corporation, will enable it to purchase, in accordance with its contracts with lending agencies, notes, or other obligations evidencing loans made by such agencies under the Corporation's programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Shall determine the character of and the necessity for its obligations and expenditures and the manner in which they shall be incurred, allowed, and paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Shall have authority to make final and conclusive settlement and adjustment of any claims by or against the Corporation or the accounts of its fiscal officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) May make such loans and advances of its funds as are necessary in the conduct of its business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) Shall have such powers as may be necessary or appropriate for the exercise of the powers specifically vested in the Corporation, and all such incidental powers as are customary in corporations generally; but any research financed by the Corporation shall relate to the conservation or disposal of commodities owned <!-- PDFPage:845 -->or controlled by the Corporation and shall be conducted in collaboration with research agencies of the Department of Agriculture. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Corporation may, in the exercise of its power to remove and dispose of surplus agricultural commodities, export, or cause to be exported, not to exceed such amounts of commodities owned by the Corporation as will enable the Corporation to finance research and development of external combustion engines using fuel other than that derived from petroleum and petroleum products. The total value of commodities exported annually for the purposes of the research authorized by the preceding sentence may not exceed $30,000,000.</p>
