<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the States should have the primary responsibility for determining what forms of <!-- PDFPage:1513 -->gambling may legally take place within their borders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Federal Government should prevent interference by one State with the gambling policies of another, and should act to protect identifiable national interests; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the limited area of interstate off-track wagering on horseraces, there is a need for Federal action to ensure States will continue to cooperate with one another in the acceptance of legal interstate wagers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is the policy of the Congress in this chapter to regulate interstate commerce with respect to wagering on horseracing, in order to further the horseracing and legal off-track betting industries in the United States.</p>
