<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 45 days after October 21, 1986, in the case of fiscal year 1987, and within 45 days after the beginning of each fiscal year after fiscal year 1987, the Secretary shall, using the best information available to the Secretary, determine and publish (along with a justification thereof) in the Federal Register the amount held in the escrow accounts described in subsections (b) and (d) of section 4501 of this title that is in excess of the amount that will be needed to make restitution to persons or classes of persons in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section and to meet other commitments of such accounts (including the requirements of section 155 of Public Law 97&ndash;377).

The Secretary shall then make available each amount apportioned for use under an energy conservation program in the same manner, to the same extent, under the same rulings and regulations, and for the same uses that Federal appropriated funds are made available and used under such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall require that amounts made available under this subsection are used to supplement, and not supplant, funds otherwise available for energy conservation activities under Federal or State law.</p>
