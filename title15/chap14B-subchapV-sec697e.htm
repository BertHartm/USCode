<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Replenishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a loss has been sustained by the Administration, any portion of the loss reserve, and other funds provided by the premier company as necessary, may be used to reimburse the Administration for the premier company's 10 percent share of the loss as provided in subsection (b)(2)(C) of this section. If the company utilizes the reserve, within 30 days it shall replace an equivalent amount of funds.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Disbursements</h4>

The notice shall be given to the company as soon as possible after the financing is identified, but not less than 90 days before the date the Administration first makes any records on such financing available for examination by prospective purchasers prior to its offering in a package of loans for bulk sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The approval of a loan by a premier certified lender shall be subject to final approval as to eligibility of any guarantee by the Administration pursuant to section 697(a) of this title, but such final approval shall not include review of decisions by the lender involving creditworthiness, loan closing, or compliance with <!-- PDFPage:823 -->legal requirements imposed by law or regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Review</h4>
