For complete classification of subtitle E to the Code, see Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 4906 of this title, referred to in par. (4), was in the original &ldquo;section 3816&rdquo;, meaning section 3816 of Pub. L. 100&ndash;418, and was translated as if it read section 5406 of Pub. L. 100&ndash;418, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 3816 was the provision which established the Data Bank in a predecessor version of H.R. 4848 (which became Pub. L. 100&ndash;418), Pub. L. 100&ndash;418 does not contain a section 3816, and section 5406 of Pub. L. 100&ndash;418 is the provision establishing the Data Bank.</p>
