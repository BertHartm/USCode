<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the price paid for such additional volume of natural gas acquired under such contract is greater than such pipeline's weighted average acquisition cost of natural gas, computed without regard to the acquisition of such additional volume of natural gas.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Commission adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case to which this subparagraph applies, the Commission shall permit an adjustment to the maximum fair and equitable price provided under subparagraph (A) to increase the revenue to the intrastate pipeline under such sale by an amount determined by the Commission to be adequate to offset the additional cost incurred by such pipeline due to any increase in such pipeline's weighted average acquisition cost of natural gas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Two-year duration</h4>
