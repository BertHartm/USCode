<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Technology and industrial innovation are central to the economic, environmental, and social well-being of citizens of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Technology and industrial innovation offer an improved standard of living, increased public and private sector productivity, creation of new industries and employment opportunities, improved public services and enhanced competitiveness of United States products in world markets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Many new discoveries and advances in science occur in universities and Federal laboratories, while the application of this new knowledge to commercial and useful public purposes depends largely upon actions by business and labor. Cooperation among academia, Federal laboratories, labor, and industry, in such forms as technology transfer, personnel exchange, joint research projects, and others, should be renewed, expanded, and strengthened.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Small businesses have performed an important role in advancing industrial and technological innovation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Industrial and technological innovation in the United States may be lagging when compared to historical patterns and other industrialized nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Increased industrial and technological innovation would reduce trade deficits, stabilize the dollar, increase productivity gains, increase employment, and stabilize prices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Government antitrust, economic, trade, patent, procurement, regulatory, research and development, and tax policies have significant impacts upon industrial innovation and development of technology, but there is insufficient knowledge of their effects in particular sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) No comprehensive national policy exists to enhance technological innovation for commercial and public purposes. There is a need for such a policy, including a strong national policy supporting domestic technology transfer and utilization of the science and technology resources of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) It is in the national interest to promote the adaptation of technological innovations to State and local government uses. Technological innovations can improve services, reduce their costs, and increase productivity in State and local governments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The Federal laboratories and other performers of federally funded research and development frequently provide scientific and technological developments of potential use to State and local governments and private industry. These developments, which include inventions, computer software, and training technologies, should be made accessible to those governments and industry. There is a need to provide means of access and to give adequate personnel and funding support to these means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The Nation should give fuller recognition to individuals and companies which have made outstanding contributions to the promotion of technology or technological manpower for the improvement of the economic, environmental, or social well-being of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (4), any royalties or other payments received by a Federal agency from the licensing and assignment of inventions under agreements entered into by Federal laboratories under section 3710a of this title, and from the licensing of inventions of Federal laboratories under section 207 of title 35 or under any other provision of law, shall be retained by the laboratory which produced the invention and shall be disposed of as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The head of the agency or laboratory, or such individual's designee, shall pay each year the first $2,000, and thereafter at least 15 percent, of the royalties or other payments, other than payments of patent costs as delineated by a license or assignment agreement, to the inventor or coinventors, if the inventor's or coinventor's rights are assigned to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) An agency or laboratory may provide appropriate incentives, from royalties, or other payments, to laboratory employees who are not an inventor of such inventions but who substantially increased the technical value of such inventions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The agency or laboratory shall retain the royalties and other payments received from an invention until the agency or laboratory makes payments to employees of a laboratory under clause (i) or (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The balance of the royalties or other payments shall be transferred by the agency to its laboratories, with the majority share of the royalties or other payments from any invention going to the laboratory where the invention occurred. The royalties or other payments so transferred to any laboratory may be <!-- PDFPage:1525 -->used or obligated by that laboratory during the fiscal year in which they are received or during the 2 succeeding fiscal years&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to reward scientific, engineering, and technical employees of the laboratory, including developers of sensitive or classified technology, regardless of whether the technology has commercial applications;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to further scientific exchange among the laboratories of the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) for education and training of employees consistent with the research and development missions and objectives of the agency or laboratory, and for other activities that increase the potential for transfer of the technology of the laboratories of the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) for payment of expenses incidental to the administration and licensing of intellectual property by the agency or laboratory with respect to inventions made at that laboratory, including the fees or other costs for the services of other agencies, persons, or organizations for intellectual property management and licensing services; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) for scientific research and development consistent with the research and development missions and objectives of the laboratory.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) All royalties or other payments retained by the agency or laboratory after payments have been made pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) that is unobligated and unexpended at the end of the second fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the royalties and other payments were received shall be paid into the Treasury.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, after payments to inventors under paragraph (1), the royalties or other payments received by an agency in any fiscal year exceed 5 percent of the budget of the agency for that year, 75 percent of such excess shall be paid to the Treasury of the United States and the remaining 25 percent may be used or obligated under paragraph (1)(B). Any funds not so used or obligated shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any payment made to an employee under this section shall be in addition to the regular pay of the employee and to any other awards made to the employee, and shall not affect the entitlement of the employee to any regular pay, annuity, or award to which he is otherwise entitled or for which he is otherwise eligible or limit the amount thereof. Any payment made to an inventor as such shall continue after the inventor leaves the laboratory or agency. Payments made under this section shall not exceed $150,000 per year to any one person, unless the President approves a larger award (with the excess over $150,000 being treated as a Presidential award under section 4504 of title 5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A Federal agency receiving royalties or other payments as a result of invention management services performed for another Federal agency or laboratory under section 207 of title 35, may retain such royalties or payments to the extent required to offset payments to inventors under clause (i) of paragraph (1)(A), costs and expenses incurred under clause (iv) of paragraph (1)(B), and the cost of foreign patenting and maintenance for any invention of the other agency. All royalties and other payments remaining after offsetting the payments to inventors, costs, and expenses described in the preceding sentence shall be transferred to the agency for which the services were performed, for distribution in accordance with paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certain assignments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the invention involved was one assigned to the Federal agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by a contractor, grantee, or participant, or an employee of a contractor, grantee, or participant, in an agreement or other arrangement with the agency, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by an employee of the agency who was not working in the laboratory at the time the invention was made,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the agency unit that was involved in such assignment shall be considered to be a laboratory for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller General shall transmit a report to the appropriate committees of the Senate and House of Representatives on the effectiveness of Federal technology transfer programs, including findings, conclusions, and recommendations for improvements in such programs.
