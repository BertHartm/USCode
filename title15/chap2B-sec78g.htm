<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rules and regulations for extension of credit; standard for initial extension; undermargined accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of preventing the excessive use of credit for the purchase or carrying of securities, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall, prior to October 1, 1934, and from time to time thereafter, prescribe rules and regulations with respect to the amount of credit that may be initially extended and subsequently maintained on any security (other than an exempted security). For the initial extension of credit, such rules and regulations shall be based upon the following standard: An amount not greater than whichever is the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 55 per centum of the current market price of the security, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 100 per centum of the lowest market price of the security during the preceding thirty-six calendar months, but not more than 75 per centum of the current market price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such rules and regulations may make appropriate provision with respect to the carrying of undermargined accounts for limited periods and under specified conditions; the withdrawal of funds or securities; the substitution or additional purchases of securities; the transfer of accounts from one lender to another; special or different margin requirements for delayed deliveries, short sales, arbitrage transactions, and securities to which paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply; the bases and the methods to be used in calculating loans, and margins and market prices; and similar administrative adjustments and details. For the purposes of paragraph (2) of this subsection, until July 1, 1936, the lowest price at which a security has sold on or after July 1, 1933, shall be considered as the lowest price at which such security has sold during the preceding thirty-six calendar months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Lower and higher margin requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Board of Governors of the <!-- PDFPage:199 -->Federal Reserve System, may, from time to time, with respect to all or specified securities or transactions, or classes of securities, or classes of transactions, by such rules and regulations (1) prescribe such lower margin requirements for the initial extension or maintenance of credit as it deems necessary or appropriate for the accommodation of commerce and industry, having due regard to the general credit situation of the country, and (2) prescribe such higher margin requirements for the initial extension or maintenance of credit as it may deem necessary or appropriate to prevent the excessive use of credit to finance transactions in securities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unlawful credit extension to customers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be unlawful for any member of a national securities exchange or any broker or dealer, directly or indirectly, to extend or maintain credit or arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for any customer&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to permit the extension or maintenance of credit in cases where the extension or maintenance of credit is not for the purpose of purchasing or carrying securities or of evading or circumventing the provisions of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a substantial portion of whose business consists of transactions with persons other than brokers or dealers; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to finance its activities as a market maker or an underwriter;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that the Board may impose such rules and regulations, in whole or in part, on any credit otherwise exempted by this paragraph if the Board determines that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
