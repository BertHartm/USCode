<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any State requesting certification must agree to accept a property report covering land located in another certified State but offered for sale or lease in the State requesting certification if the property report has been approved by the other certified State.

The Secretary may accept for such filing, and declare effective as the Federal statement of record and property report, such materials and documentation found acceptable by the State in connection with the sale or lease of lots located outside that State.

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall periodically review the laws and regulations, and the administration thereof, of States certified under subsection (a) of this section, and may withdraw such certification upon a determination that such laws, regulations, and the administration thereof, taken as a whole, no longer meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State and local governmental authorities affected; cooperation with State authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or limit the authority of any State or local government to enact and enforce with regard to the sale of land any law, ordinance, or code not in conflict with this chapter. In administering this chapter, the Secretary shall cooperate with State authorities charged with the responsibility of regulating the sale or lease of lots which are subject to this chapter.</p>
