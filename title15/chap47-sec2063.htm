<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) accreditation of the conformity assessment body would provide equal or greater consumer safety protection than the manufacturer's or private labeler's use of an independent third party conformity assessment body; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the conformity assessment body has established procedures to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) its test results are protected from undue influence by the manufacturer, private labeler or other interested party;</p>
