<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas during any natural gas supply emergency declared under section 3361 of this title, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any interstate pipeline;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any local distribution company&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is served by any interstate pipeline;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is providing natural gas only for high-priority uses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) which is in need of deliveries of natural gas to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any person for meeting requirements of high-priority uses of natural gas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of certain boiler fuel gas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required finding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to the maximum extent practicable, emergency purchase authority under section 3362 of this title has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) emergency purchases of natural gas supplies under section 3362 of this title are not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to to&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3363_1_target" name="3363_1">1</a></sup> the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (1), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas the use of which has been prohibited by the President pursuant to authority under section 717z of this title (relating to the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel during any natural gas supply emergency).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of general pipeline supply</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to the maximum extent practicable, allocation of supplies of natural gas under subsection (b) of this section has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the exercise of such authority is not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such allocation will not create, for the interstate pipeline delivering certificated natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such pipeline to be unable to meet the natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas served, directly or indirectly, by such pipeline; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) such allocation will not result in a disproportionate share of deliveries and resulting curtailments of natural gas being experienced by such interstate pipeline when compared to deliveries and resulting curtailments which are experienced as a result of orders issued under this subsection applicable to other interstate pipelines (as determined by the President).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Required notification from State</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3363_2_target" name="3363_2">2</a></sup> Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he is notified by the Governor of any State that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a shortage of natural gas supplies available to such State exists or is imminent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such shortage or imminent shortage endangers the supply of natural gas for high-priority uses in such State; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1277 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the exercise of authority under State law is inadequate to protect high-priority uses of natural gas in such State from an interruption in natural gas supplies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis of finding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the maximum extent practicable, the Governor shall submit, together with any notification under subparagraph (A), information upon which he has based his finding under such subparagraph, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) volumes of natural gas required to meet the natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas in such State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) information received from persons in the business of producing, selling, transporting, or delivering natural gas in such State as to the volumes of natural gas supplies available to such State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) information on the authority under State law which will be exercised to protect high-priority uses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) such other information which the President requests or which the Governor determines appropriate to apprise the President of emergency deliveries and transportation of interstate natural gas needed by such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Allocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraphs (1), (2), and (5), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of certificated natural gas from any interstate pipeline.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such allocation will not create, for the person who owns and would otherwise use such natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such person to be unable to satisfy such person's natural gas requirements for high-priority uses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraphs (1) and (3), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas which would be certificated natural gas but for the second sentence of section 3301(19) of this title.</p>
