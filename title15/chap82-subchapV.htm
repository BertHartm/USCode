<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of content of basic data set</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the initial content of, or in upgrading, the basic data set, the Secretary of&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5652_1_target" name="5652_1">1</a></sup> Interior shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consult with and seek the advice of users and producers of remote sensing data and data products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the need for data which may be duplicative in terms of geographical coverage but which differ in terms of season, spectral bands, resolution, or other relevant factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) include, as the Secretary of the Interior considers appropriate, unenhanced data generated either by the Landsat system, pursuant to subchapter I of this chapter, or by licensees under subchapter II of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) include, as the Secretary of the Interior considers appropriate, data collected by foreign ground stations or by foreign remote sensing space systems; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Landsat Program Management shall consult with the Secretary of Defense on all matters under this chapter affecting national security. The Secretary of Defense shall be responsible for determining those conditions, consistent with this chapter, necessary to meet national security concerns of the United States and for notifying the Secretary and the Landsat Program Management promptly of such conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consultation with Secretary of State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary and the Landsat Program Management shall consult with the Secretary of State on all matters under this chapter affecting international obligations. The Secretary of State shall be responsible for determining those conditions, consistent with this chapter, necessary to meet international obligations and policies of the United States and for notifying promptly the Secretary and the Landsat Program Management of such conditions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of State shall promptly report to the Secretary and Landsat Program Management any instances outside the United States of discriminatory distribution of Landsat data.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Status report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Landsat Program Management shall, as often as necessary, provide to the Congress complete and updated information about the status of ongoing operations of the Landsat system, including timely notification of decisions made with respect to the Landsat system in order to meet national security concerns and international obligations and policies of the United States Government.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to ensure that unenhanced data from the Landsat system received solely for noncommercial purposes are not used for any commercial purpose, the Secretary (in collaboration with private sector entities responsible for the marketing and distribution of unenhanced data generated by the Landsat system) shall develop and implement a system for enforcing this prohibition, in the event that unenhanced data from the Landsat system are made available for noncommercial purposes at a different price than such data are made available for other purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary may impose any of the enforcement mechanisms described in subsection (c) of this section against a person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) receives unenhanced data from the Landsat system under this chapter solely for noncommercial purposes (and at a different price than the price at which such data are made available for other purposes); and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1585 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) uses such data for other than noncommercial purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement mechanisms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Enforcement mechanisms referred to in subsection (b) of this section may include civil penalties of not more than $10,000 (per day per violation), denial of further unenhanced data purchasing privileges, and any other penalties or restrictions the Secretary considers necessary to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that unenhanced data provided for noncommercial purposes are not used to unfairly compete in the commercial market against private sector entities not eligible for data at the cost of fulfilling user requests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedures and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall issue any regulations necessary to carry out this section and shall establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of enforcement mechanisms under subsection (b) of this section. The standards and procedures shall include a procedure for potentially aggrieved parties to file formal protests with the Secretary alleging instances where such unenhanced data has been, or is being, used for commercial purposes in violation of the terms of receipt of such data. The Secretary shall promptly act to investigate any such protest, and shall report annually to the Congress on instances of such violations.</p>
