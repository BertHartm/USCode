<p class="note-body">(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section there are hereby transferred from the Securities and Exchange Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, to the Chairman of the Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Chairman, the executive and administrative functions of the Commission, including functions of the Commission with respect to (1) the appointment and supervision of personnel employed under the Commission, (2) the distribution of business among such personnel and among administrative units of the Commission, and (3) the use and expenditure of funds.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b)(1) In carrying out any of his functions under the provisions of this section the Chairman shall be governed by general policies of the Commission and by such regulatory decisions, findings, and determinations as the Commission may by law be authorized to make.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The appointment by the Chairman of the heads of major administrative units under the Commission shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Personnel employed regularly and full time in the immediate offices of Commissioners other than the Chairman shall not be affected by the provisions of this reorganization plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) There are hereby reserved to the Commission its functions with respect to revising budget estimates and with respect to determining upon the distribution of appropriated funds according to major programs and purposes.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 2. Performance of Transferred Functions</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Chairman may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any officer, employee, or administrative unit under his jurisdiction of any function transferred to the Chairman by the provisions of section 1 of this reorganization plan.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 3. Designation of Chairman</h4>
<p class="note-body">The functions of the Commission with respect to choosing a Chairman from among the Commissioners <!-- PDFPage:188 -->composing the Commission are hereby transferred to the President.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and providing for reorganizations in the Securities and Exchange Commission. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is not practicable.</p>
