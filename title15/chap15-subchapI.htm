<p class="statutory-body">With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to issue and have outstanding at any one time, bonds, notes, debentures, and other similar obligations in an aggregate amount not exceeding $30,000,000,000. Such obligations shall be in such forms and denominations, shall have such maturities, shall bear such rates of interest, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall be issued in such manner and sold at such prices as may be prescribed by the Commodity Credit Corporation, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such obligations shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed both as to interest and principal by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face thereof, and such obligations shall be lawful investments and may be accepted as security for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds the investment or deposit of which shall be under the authority or control of the United States or any officer or officers thereof. In the event that the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be unable to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of, or interest on, such obligations, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holder the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, is authorized to purchase any obligations of the Commodity Credit Corporation issued hereunder, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31 and the purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchases of the Commodity Credit Corporation's obligations hereunder. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the obligations of the Commodity Credit Corporation acquired by him under this section. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of the obligations of the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be treated as public-debt transactions of the United States. No such obligations shall be issued in excess of the assets of the Commodity Credit Corporation, including the assets to be obtained from the proceeds of such obligations, but a failure to comply with this provision shall not invalidate the obligations or the guaranty of the same: <em>Provided</em>, That this sentence shall not limit the authority of the Corporation to issue obligations for the purpose of carrying out its annual budget programs submitted to and approved by the Congress pursuant to chapter 91 of title 31.

<p class="statutory-body">In determining specific cotton to be exchanged under this section, the determination shall be made by sampling and selection at the place where the cotton is stored on the date of ratification of a treaty providing for such exchange, and no cotton shall be exchanged under such treaty which, after such date, is transported to another place and there sampled and selected. Such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials shall be stored on military or naval reservations or in other locations approved by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy. The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to transfer such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture shall approve, to any other governmental agency. Such reserve stocks or strategic and critical materials shall be made available or disposed of by the Commodity Credit Corporation or other governmental agency only upon order of the President in accordance with the terms of the applicable treaty; when necessary to prevent deterioration, the Commodity Credit Corporation or other governmental agency is authorized to replace those quantities of the reserve stocks of such strategic and critical materials subject to deterioration with equivalent quantities of the same materials.

<p class="statutory-body">During the period beginning 60 days after December 23, 1985, and ending on December 31, 2007, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall establish and operate an export incentive program as described in this section for dairy products under section 714c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments to entity that sells for export United States dairy products; bid basis; criteria for acceptance or rejection of bids</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program established under subsection (a) of this section shall provide for the Corporation to make payments, on a bid basis, to an entity that sells for export United States dairy products. The Secretary shall have sole discretion to accept or reject bids under such criteria as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program shall be operated under such rules and regulations issued by the Secretary as the Secretary deems necessary to ensure, among other things, that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent practicable, dairy products sold for export under the program will not displace commercial export sales of United States dairy products by other exporters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the maximum volume of dairy product exports allowable consistent with the obligations of the United States as a member of the World Trade Organization is exported under the program each year (minus the volume sold under section 1163 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Public Law 99&ndash;198; 7 U.S.C. 1731 note) during that year), except to the extent that the export of such a volume under the program would, in the judgment of the Secretary, exceed the limitations on the value set forth in subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) payments may be made under the program for exports to any destination in the world for the purpose of market development, except a destination in a country with respect to which shipments from the United States are otherwise restricted by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments under program to be made in cash or commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The regulations issued by the Secretary may provide for payments under the program to be made in cash or in commodities of equal value that are available in Commodity Credit Corporation stock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If payments in commodities are authorized, such payments shall be made through the issuance of generic certificates redeemable in commodities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If generic certificates issued in accordance with the program provided for by this section are exchanged for dairy products owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation, the regulations issued by the Secretary shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such dairy products, or an equal quantity of other dairy products, will be sold for export by the entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any such export sales by the entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will be in addition to, and not in place of, export sales of dairy products that the entity would otherwise make under the program or in the absence of the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to the extent practicable, will not displace commercial export sales of United States dairy products by other exporters.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment rates; publication in Federal Register or other public announcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The payments made under the program shall be made at a rate or rates established or approved by the Secretary, taking into consideration, among other things the type of product to be exported, the domestic price of dairy products, the world price of the dairy products, and any additional amount that may be required to assist in the development of world markets for United States dairy products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such rate established or approved by the Secretary shall be published in the Federal Register or publicly announced through other appropriate means, and shall be at a level or levels as will encourage the exportation of United States dairy products by entities.</p>
