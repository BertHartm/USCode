<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) High-performance computing and associated technologies are critical to the United States economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) While the United States has led the development of high-performance computing, United States industry is facing increasing global competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite existing international agreements on fair competition and nondiscrimination in government procurements, there is increasing concern that such agreements are not being honored, that more aggressive enforcement of such agreements is needed, and that additional steps may be required to ensure fair global competition, particularly in high-technology fields such as high-performance computing and associated technologies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It is appropriate for Federal agencies and departments to use the funds authorized for the Program in a manner which most effectively fosters the maintenance and development of United States leadership in high-performance computers and associated technologies in and for the benefit of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) It is appropriate for Federal agencies and departments to use the funds authorized for the Program in a manner, consistent with the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.), which most effectively fosters reciprocal competitive procurement treatment by foreign governments for United States high-performance computing and associated technology products and suppliers.</p>

Within 180 days after December 9, 1991, the Under Secretary shall submit a report to Congress containing the results of such study.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consultation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application of Buy American Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This chapter does not affect the applicability of title III of the Act of March 3, 1933 (41 U.S.C. 10a&ndash;10d;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5528_1_target" name="5528_1">1</a></sup> popularly known as the Buy American Act), as amended by the Buy American Act of 1988, to procurements by Federal agencies and departments undertaken as a part of the Program.</p>
