<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Industrial, agricultural, and other human activities, coupled with an expanding world population, are contributing to processes of global change that may significantly alter the Earth habitat within a few human generations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such human-induced changes, in conjunction with natural fluctuations, may lead to significant global warming and thus alter world climate patterns and increase global sea levels. Over the next century, these consequences could adversely affect world agricultural and marine production, coastal habitability, biological diversity, human health, and global economic and social well-being.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The release of chlorofluorocarbons and other stratospheric ozone-depleting substances is rapidly reducing the ability of the atmosphere to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation, which could adversely affect human health and ecological systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Development of effective policies to abate, mitigate, and cope with global change will rely on greatly improved scientific understanding of global environmental processes and on our ability to distinguish human-induced from natural global change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) New developments in interdisciplinary Earth sciences, global observing systems, and computing technology make possible significant advances in the scientific understanding and prediction of these global changes and their effects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Although significant Federal global change research efforts are underway, an effective Federal research program will require efficient interagency coordination, and coordination with the research activities of State, private, and international entities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for development and coordination of a compre<!-- PDFPage:1437 -->hensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An international global change research program will be important in building future consensus on methods for reducing global environmental degradation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States, as a world leader in environmental and Earth sciences, should help provide leadership in developing and implementing an international global change research program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote international, intergovernmental cooperation on global change research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve scientists and policymakers from developing nations in such cooperative global change research programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) promote international efforts to provide technical and other assistance to developing nations which will facilitate improvements in their domestic standard of living while minimizing damage to the global or regional environment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Allocation of costs in global change research programs, especially with respect to major capital projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Coordination of global change research plans with those developed by international organizations such as the International Council on Scientific Unions, the World Meteorological Organization, and the United Nations Environment Program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Establishment of global change research centers and training programs for scientists, especially those from developing nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Development of innovative methods for management of international global change research, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) use of new or existing intergovernmental organizations for the coordination or funding of global change research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) creation of a limited foundation for global change research.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The prompt establishment of international projects to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) create globally accessible formats for data collected by various international sources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) combine and interpret data from various sources to produce information readily usable by policymakers attempting to formulate effective strategies for preventing, mitigating, and adapting to possible adverse effects of global change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Establishment of international offices to disseminate information useful in identifying, preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the possible effects of global change.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The President should direct the Secretary of State (in cooperation with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and other appropriate members of the Committee) to initiate discussions with other nations leading toward an international research protocol for cooperation on the development of energy technologies which have minimally adverse effects on the environment. Such discussions should include, but not be limited to, the following issues:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Creation of an international cooperative program to fund research related to energy efficiency, solar and other renewable energy sources, and passively safe and diversion-resistant nuclear reactors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Creation of an international cooperative program to develop low cost energy technologies which are appropriate to the environmental, economic, and social needs of developing nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Exchange of information concerning environmentally safe energy technologies and practices, including those described in paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
