The amount of a grant under this subsection shall be determined by the Administrator, except that no grant for any State program may exceed 75 per centum of the establishment and operation costs (as determined by the Administrator) of such program during the period for which the grant is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval by Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No grant may be made under subsection (a) of this section unless an application therefor is submitted to and approved by the Administrator. Such an application shall be submitted in such form and manner as the Administrator may require and shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) set forth the need of the applicant for a grant under subsection (a) of this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify the agency or agencies of the State which shall establish or operate, or both, the program for which the application is submitted,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) describe the actions proposed to be taken under such program,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may approve an application submitted in accordance with paragraph (1) only if the applicant has established to the satisfaction of the Administrator a priority need, as determined under rules of the Administrator, <!-- PDFPage:1359 -->for the grant for which the application has been submitted. Such rules shall take into consideration the seriousness of the health effects in a State which are associated with chemical substances or mixtures, including cancer, birth defects, and gene mutations, the extent of the exposure in a State of human beings and the environment to chemical substances and mixtures, and the extent to which chemical substances and mixtures are manufactured, processed, used, and disposed of in a State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Annual reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than six months after the end of each of the fiscal years 1979, 1980, and 1981, the Administrator shall submit to the Congress a report respecting the programs assisted by grants under subsection (a) of this section in the preceding fiscal year and the extent to which the Administrator has disseminated information respecting such programs.</p>
