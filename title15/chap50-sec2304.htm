<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Remedies under written warranty; duration of implied warranty; exclusion or limitation on consequential damages for breach of written or implied warranty; election of refund or replacement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order for a warrantor warranting a consumer product by means of a written warranty to meet the Federal minimum standards for warranty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such warrantor must as a minimum remedy such consumer product within a reasonable time and without charge, in the case of a defect, malfunction, or failure to conform with such written warranty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) notwithstanding section 2308(b) of this title, such warrantor may not impose any limitation on the duration of any implied warranty on the product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such warrantor may not exclude or limit consequential damages for breach of any written or implied warranty on such product, unless such exclusion or limitation conspicuously appears on the face of the warranty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the product (or a component part thereof) contains a defect or malfunction after a reasonable number of attempts by the warrantor to remedy defects or malfunctions in such product, such warrantor must permit the consumer to elect either a refund for, or replacement without charge of, such product or part (as the case may be). The Commission may by rule specify for purposes of this paragraph, what constitutes a reasonable number of attempts to remedy particular kinds of defects or malfunctions under different circumstances. If the warrantor replaces a component part of a consumer product, such replacement shall include installing the part in the product without charge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Duties and conditions imposed on consumer by warrantor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In fulfilling the duties under subsection (a) of this section respecting a written warranty, the warrantor shall not impose any duty other than notification upon any consumer as a condition of securing remedy of any consumer product which malfunctions, is defective, or does not conform to the written warranty, unless the warrantor has demonstrated in a rulemaking proceeding, or can demonstrate in an administrative or judicial enforcement proceeding (including private enforcement), or in an informal dispute settlement proceeding, that such a duty is reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a warrantor may require, as a condition to replacement of, or refund for, any consumer product under subsection (a) of this section, that such consumer product shall be made available to the warrantor free and clear of liens and other encumbrances, except as otherwise provided by rule or order of the Commission in cases in which such a requirement would not be practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may, by rule define in detail the duties set forth in subsection (a) of this section and the applicability of such duties to warrantors of different categories of consumer <!-- PDFPage:1336 -->products with &ldquo;full (statement of duration)&rdquo; warranties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The duties under subsection (a) of this section extend from the warrantor to each person who is a consumer with respect to the consumer product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The performance of the duties under subsection (a) of this section shall not be required of the warrantor if he can show that the defect, malfunction, or failure of any warranted consumer product to conform with a written warranty, was caused by damage (not resulting from defect or malfunction) while in the possession of the consumer, or unreasonable use (including failure to provide reasonable and necessary maintenance).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Remedy without charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section and of section 2302(c) of this title, the term &ldquo;without charge&rdquo; means that the warrantor may not assess the consumer for any costs the warrantor or his representatives incur in connection with the required remedy of a warranted consumer product. An obligation under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section to remedy without charge does not necessarily require the warrantor to compensate the consumer for incidental expenses; however, if any incidental expenses are incurred because the remedy is not made within a reasonable time or because the warrantor imposed an unreasonable duty upon the consumer as a condition of securing remedy, then the consumer shall be entitled to recover reasonable incidental expenses which are so incurred in any action against the warrantor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Incorporation of standards to products designated with full warranty for purposes of judicial actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a supplier designates a warranty applicable to a consumer product as a &ldquo;full (statement of duration)&rdquo; warranty, then the warranty on such product shall, for purposes of any action under section 2310(d) of this title or under any State law, be deemed to incorporate at least the minimum requirements of this section and rules prescribed under this section.</p>
