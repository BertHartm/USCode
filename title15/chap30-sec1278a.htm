<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General lead ban</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Treatment as a banned hazardous substance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as expressly provided in subsection (b) beginning on the dates provided in paragraph (2), any children's product (as defined in section 3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a))) that contains more lead than the limit established by paragraph (2) shall be treated as a banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Lead limit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) 600 parts per million</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E), beginning 180 days after August 14, 2008, the lead limit referred to in paragraph (1) is 600 parts per million total lead content by weight for any part of the product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) 300 parts per million</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided by subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E), beginning on the date that is 1 year after August 14, 2008, the lead limit referred to in paragraph (1) is 300 parts per million total lead content by weight for any part of the product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) 100 parts per million</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (D) and (E), beginning on the date that is 3 years after August 14, 2008, subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;100 parts per million&rdquo; for &ldquo;300 parts per million&rdquo; unless the Commission determines that a limit of 100 parts per million is not technologically feasible for a product or product category. The Commission may make such a determination only after notice and a hearing and after analyzing the public health protections associated with substantially reducing lead in children's products.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Alternate reduction of limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission determines under subparagraph (C) that the 100 parts per million limit is not technologically feasible for a product or product category, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish an amount that is the lowest amount of lead, lower than 300 parts per million, the Commission determines to be technologically feasible to achieve for that product or product category. The amount of lead established by the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be substituted for the 300 parts per million limit under subparagraph (B) beginning on the date that is 3 years after August 14, 2008.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Periodic review and further reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall, based on the best available scientific and technical information, periodically review and revise downward the limit set forth in this subsection, no less frequently than every 5 years after promulgation of the limit under subparagraph (C) or (D) to require the lowest amount of lead that the Commission determines is technologically feasible to achieve. The amount of lead established by the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be substituted for the lead limit in effect immediately before such revision.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each limit set forth in paragraph (2) (except for the limit set forth in subparagraphs (A) <!-- PDFPage:1199 -->and (B)) shall apply only to a children's product (as defined in section 3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a))) that is manufactured after the effective date of such respective limit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of certain materials or products and inaccessible component parts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Functional purpose exception</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission, on its own initiative or upon petition by an interested party, shall grant an exception to the limit in subsection (a) for a specific product, class of product, material, or component part if the Commission, after notice and a hearing, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the product, class of product, material, or component part requires the inclusion of lead because it is not practicable or not technologically feasible to manufacture such product, class of product, material, or component part, as the case may be, in accordance with subsection (a) by removing the excessive lead or by making the lead inaccessible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the product, class of product, material, or component part is not likely to be placed in the mouth or ingested, taking into account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, class of product, material, or component part by a child; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an exception for the product, class of product, material, or component part will have no measurable adverse effect on public health or safety, taking into account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Measurement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii), there is no measurable adverse effect on public health or safety if the exception described in subparagraph (A) will result in no measurable increase in blood lead levels of a child. The Commission may adopt an alternative method of measurement other than blood lead levels if it determines, after notice and a hearing, that such alternative method is a better scientific method for measuring adverse effect on public health and safety.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Procedures for granting exception</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A party seeking an exception under subparagraph (A) has the burden of demonstrating that it meets the requirements of such subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Grounds for decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case where a party has petitioned for an exception, in determining whether to grant the exception, the Commission may base its decision solely on the materials presented by the party seeking the exception and any materials received through notice and a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Admissible evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In demonstrating that it meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), a party seeking an exception under such subparagraph may rely on any nonproprietary information submitted by any other party seeking such an exception and such information shall be considered part of the record presented by the party that relies on that information.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Scope of exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If an exception is sought for an entire product, the burden is on the petitioning party to demonstrate that the criteria in subparagraph (A) are met with respect to every accessible component or accessible material of the product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limitation on exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission grants an exception for a product, class of product, material, or component part under subparagraph (A), the Commission may, as necessary to protect public health or safety&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) establish a lead limit that such product, class of product, material, or component part may not exceed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) place a manufacturing expiration date on such exception or establish a schedule after which the manufacturer of such product, class of product, material, or component part shall be in full compliance with the limit established under clause (i) or the limit set forth in subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Application of exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An exception under subparagraph (A) for a product, class of product, material, or component part shall apply regardless of the date of manufacture unless the Commission expressly provides otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Previously submitted petitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A party seeking an exception under this paragraph may rely on materials previously submitted in connection with a petition for exclusion under this section. In such cases, petitioners must notify the Commission of their intent to rely on materials previously submitted. Such reliance does not affect petitioners&rsquo; obligation to demonstrate that they meet all requirements of this paragraph as required by subparagraph (C)(i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for inaccessible component parts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limits established under subsection (a) shall not apply to any component part of a children's product that is not accessible to a child through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, as determined by the Commission. A component part is not accessible under this subparagraph if such component part is not physically exposed by reason of a sealed covering or casing and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product. Reasonably foreseeable use and abuse shall include swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children's activities, and the aging of the product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Inaccessibility proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall promulgate a rule provid<!-- PDFPage:1200 -->ing guidance with respect to what product components, or classes of components, will be considered to be inaccessible for purposes of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application pending CPSC guidance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Until the Commission promulgates a rule pursuant to subparagraph (B), the determination of whether a product component is inaccessible to a child shall be made in accordance with the requirements laid out in subparagraph (A) for considering a component to be inaccessible to a child.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain barriers disqualified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, paint, coatings, or electroplating may not be considered to be a barrier that would render lead in the substrate inaccessible to a child, or to prevent absorption of any lead into the human body, through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certain electronic devices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines that it is not technologically feasible for certain electronic devices, including devices containing batteries, to comply with subsection (a), the Commission, by regulation, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue requirements to eliminate or minimize the potential for exposure to and accessibility of lead in such electronic devices, which may include requirements that such electronic devices be equipped with a child-resistant cover or casing that prevents exposure to and accessibility of the parts of the product containing lead; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish a schedule by which such electronic devices shall be in full compliance with the limits in subsection (a), unless the Commission determines that full compliance will not be technologically feasible for such devices within a schedule set by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exception for off-highway vehicles</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsection (a) shall not apply to an off-highway vehicle.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission determines, based on the study in subparagraph (A), that x-ray fluorescence technology or other alternative methods for measuring lead in paint are as effective, precise, and reliable as the methodology used by the Commission for compliance determinations prior to August 14, 2008, the Commission may promulgate regulations governing the use of such methods in determining the compliance of products with part 1303 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, as modified pursuant to this subsection. Any regulations promulgated by the Commission shall ensure that such alternative methods are no less effective, precise, and reliable than the methodology used by the Commission prior to August 14, 2008.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, no less frequently than every 5 years after the Commission completes the study required by paragraph (4)(A), review and revise any methods for measurement utilized by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (3) or pursuant to any regulations promulgated under paragraph (4) to ensure that such methods are the most effective methods available to protect children's health. The Commission shall conduct an ongoing effort to study and encourage the further development of alternative methods for measuring lead in paint and other surface coating that can effectively, precisely, and reliably detect lead levels at or below the level set forth in part 1303 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, or any lower level established by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) No effect on legal limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in paragraph (3), nor reliance by the Commission on any alternative method of measurement pursuant to such paragraph, nor any rule prescribed pursuant to paragraph (4), nor any method established pursuant to paragraph (5) shall be construed to alter the limit set forth in section 1303 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, as modified pursuant to this subsection, or provide any exemption from such limit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the authority of the Commis<!-- PDFPage:1202 -->sion or any other person to use alternative methods for detecting lead as a screening method to determine whether further testing or action is needed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Treatment as a regulation under the FHSA</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any ban imposed by subsection (a) or rule promulgated under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, and section 1303.1 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations (as modified pursuant to subsection (f)(1) or (2)), or any successor regulation, shall be considered a regulation of the Commission promulgated under or for the enforcement of section 2(q) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261(q)).</p>
