<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each plaintiff seeking to serve as a representative party on behalf of a class shall provide a sworn certification, which shall be personally signed by such plaintiff and filed with the complaint, that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonwaiver of attorney-client privilege</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The certification filed pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to be a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Early notice to class members</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than 20 days after the date on which the complaint is filed, the plaintiff or plaintiffs shall cause to be published, in a widely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire service, a notice advising members of the purported plaintiff class&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Consolidated actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same claim or claims arising under this chapter has been filed, and any party has sought to consolidate those actions for pretrial purposes or for trial, the court shall not make the determination required by clause (i) until after the decision on the motion to consolidate is rendered. As soon as practicable after such decision is rendered, the court shall appoint the most adequate plaintiff as lead plaintiff for the consolidated actions in accordance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, discovery relating to whether a member or members of the purported plaintiff class is the most adequate plaintiff may be conducted by a plaintiff only if the plaintiff first demonstrates a reasonable basis for a finding that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff is incapable of adequately representing the class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Selection of lead counsel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The most adequate plaintiff shall, subject to the approval of the court, select and retain counsel to represent the class.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recovery by plaintiffs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The share of any final judgment or of any settlement that is awarded to a representative party serving on behalf of a class shall be equal, on a per share basis, to the portion of the final judgment or settlement awarded to all other members of the class. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the award of reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages) directly relating to the representation of the class to any representative party serving on behalf of a class.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Restrictions on settlements under seal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms and provisions of any settlement agreement of a class action shall not be filed under seal, except that on motion of any party to the settlement, the court may order filing under seal for those portions of a settlement agreement as to which good cause is shown for such filing under seal. For purposes of this paragraph, good cause shall exist only if publication of a term or provision of a settlement agreement would cause direct and substantial harm to any party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Restrictions on payment of attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Total attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses awarded by the court to counsel for the plaintiff class shall not exceed a reasonable percentage of the amount of any damages and prejudgment interest actually paid to the class.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the parties do not agree on the average amount of damages per share that would be recoverable if the plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged under this chapter, a statement from each settling party concerning the issue or issues on which the parties disagree.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Inadmissibility for certain purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A statement made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) concerning the amount of damages shall not be admissible in any Federal or State judicial action or administrative proceeding, other than an action or proceeding arising out of such statement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any of the settling parties or their counsel intend to apply to the court for an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees or costs from any fund established as part of the settlement, a statement indicating which parties or counsel intend to make such an application, the amount of fees and costs that will be sought (including the amount of such fees and costs determined on an average per share basis), and a brief explanation supporting the fees and costs sought.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a plaintiff class is represented by an attorney who directly owns or otherwise has a beneficial interest in the securities that are the subject of the litigation, the court shall make a determination of whether such ownership or other interest constitutes a conflict of interest sufficient to disqualify the attorney from representing the plaintiff class.</p>
