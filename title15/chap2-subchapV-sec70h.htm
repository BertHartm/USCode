Said guaranty shall be (1) a separate guaranty specifically designating the textile fiber product guaranteed, in which case it may be on the invoice or other paper relating to said product; or (2) a continuing guaranty given by seller to the buyer applicable to all textile fiber products sold to or to be sold to buyer by seller in a form as the Commission, by rules and regulations, may prescribe; or (3) a continuing guaranty filed with the Commission applicable to all textile fiber products handled by a guarantor in such form as the Commission by rules and regulations may prescribe.</p>
