<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Ability to repay</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with regulations prescribed by the Bureau, no creditor may make a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multiple loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the creditor knows, or has reason to know, that 1 or more residential mortgage loans secured by the same dwelling will be made to the same consumer, the creditor shall make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the combined payments of all loans on the same dwelling according to the terms of those loans and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A determination under this subsection of a consumer's ability to repay a residential mortgage loan shall include consideration of the consumer's credit history, current income, expected income the consumer is reasonably assured of receiving, current obligations, debt-to-income ratio or the residual income the consumer will have after paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related obligations, employment status, and other financial resources other than the consumer's equity in the dwelling or real property that secures repayment of the loan. A creditor shall determine the ability of the consumer to repay using a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the term of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A creditor making a residential mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that such creditor relies on to determine repayment ability, including expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumer's Internal Revenue Service Form W&ndash;2, tax returns, payroll receipts, financial institution records, or other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's income or assets. In order to safeguard against fraudulent reporting, any consideration of a consumer's income history in making a determination under this subsection shall include the verification of such income by the use of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Internal Revenue Service transcripts of tax returns; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a method that quickly and effectively verifies income documentation by a third party subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to loans made, guaranteed, or insured by Federal departments or agencies identified in subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), such departments or agencies may exempt refinancings under a streamlined refinancing from this income verification requirement as long as the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The consumer is not 30 days or more past due on the prior existing residential mortgage loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The refinancing does not increase the principal balance outstanding on the prior existing residential mortgage loan, except to the extent of fees and charges allowed by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Total points and fees (as defined in section 1602(aa)(4) of this title, other than bona fide third party charges not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate <!-- PDFPage:1304 -->of the creditor or mortgage originator) payable in connection with the refinancing do not exceed 3 percent of the total new loan amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The interest rate on the refinanced loan is lower than the interest rate of the original loan, unless the borrower is refinancing from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate loan, under guidelines that the department or agency shall establish for loans they make, guarantee, or issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The refinancing is subject to a payment schedule that will fully amortize the refinancing in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The terms of the refinancing do not result in a balloon payment, as defined in subsection (b)(2)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Both the residential mortgage loan being refinanced and the refinancing satisfy all requirements of the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Nonstandard loans</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Variable rate loans that defer repayment of any principal or interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining, under this subsection, a consumer's ability to repay a variable rate residential mortgage loan that allows or requires the consumer to defer the repayment of any principal or interest, the creditor shall use a fully amortizing repayment schedule.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interest-only loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining, under this subsection, a consumer's ability to repay a residential mortgage loan that permits or requires the payment of interest only, the creditor shall use the payment amount required to amortize the loan by its final maturity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Calculation for negative amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making any determination under this subsection, a creditor shall also take into consideration any balance increase that may accrue from any negative amortization provision.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Calculation process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of making any determination under this subsection, a creditor shall calculate the monthly payment amount for principal and interest on any residential mortgage loan by assuming&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the loan proceeds are fully disbursed on the date of the consummation of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the loan is to be repaid in substantially equal monthly amortizing payments for principal and interest over the entire term of the loan with no balloon payment, unless the loan contract requires more rapid repayment (including balloon payment), in which case the calculation shall be made (I) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Bureau, with respect to any loan which has an annual percentage rate that does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction, as of the date the interest rate is set, by 1.5 or more percentage points for a first lien residential mortgage loan; and by 3.5 or more percentage points for a subordinate lien residential mortgage loan; or (II) using the contract's repayment schedule, with respect to a loan which has an annual percentage rate, as of the date the interest rate is set, that is at least 1.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for a first lien residential mortgage loan; and 3.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for a subordinate lien residential mortgage loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the interest rate over the entire term of the loan is a fixed rate equal to the fully indexed rate at the time of the loan closing, without considering the introductory rate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Refinance of hybrid loans with current lender</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In considering any application for refinancing an existing hybrid loan by the creditor into a standard loan to be made by the same creditor in any case in which there would be a reduction in monthly payment and the mortgagor has not been delinquent on any payment on the existing hybrid loan, the creditor may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) consider the mortgagor's good standing on the existing mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consider if the extension of new credit would prevent a likely default should the original mortgage reset and give such concerns a higher priority as an acceptable underwriting practice; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) offer rate discounts and other favorable terms to such mortgagor that would be available to new customers with high credit ratings based on such underwriting practice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Fully-indexed rate defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;fully indexed rate&rdquo; means the index rate prevailing on a residential mortgage loan at the time the loan is made plus the margin that will apply after the expiration of any introductory interest rates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Reverse mortgages and bridge loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply with respect to any reverse mortgage or temporary or bridge loan with a term of 12 months or less, including to any loan to purchase a new dwelling where the consumer plans to sell a different dwelling within 12 months.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Seasonal income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If documented income, including income from a small business, is a repayment source for a residential mortgage loan, a creditor may consider the seasonality and irregularity of such income in the underwriting of and scheduling of payments for such credit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presumption of ability to repay</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any creditor with respect to any residential mortgage loan, and any assignee of such loan <!-- PDFPage:1305 -->subject to liability under this subchapter, may presume that the loan has met the requirements of subsection (a), if the loan is a qualified mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Qualified mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified mortgage&rdquo; means any residential mortgage loan&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) except as provided in subparagraph (E), allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (E), the terms of which do not result in a balloon payment, where a &ldquo;balloon payment&rdquo; is a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for which the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the obligors on the loan are verified and documented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) in the case of a fixed rate loan, for which the underwriting process is based on a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the loan term and takes into account all applicable taxes, insurance, and assessments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) in the case of an adjustable rate loan, for which the underwriting is based on the maximum rate permitted under the loan during the first 5 years, and a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the loan term and takes into account all applicable taxes, insurance, and assessments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) that complies with any guidelines or regulations established by the Bureau relating to ratios of total monthly debt to monthly income or alternative measures of ability to pay regular expenses after payment of total monthly debt, taking into account the income levels of the borrower and such other factors as the Bureau may determine relevant and consistent with the purposes described in paragraph (3)(B)(i);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) for which the total points and fees (as defined in subparagraph (C)) payable in connection with the loan do not exceed 3 percent of the total loan amount;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) for which the term of the loan does not exceed 30 years, except as such term may be extended under paragraph (3), such as in high-cost areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) in the case of a reverse mortgage (except for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, to the extent that such mortgages are exempt altogether from those requirements), a reverse mortgage which meets the standards for a qualified mortgage, as set by the Bureau in rules that are consistent with the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Average prime offer rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;average prime offer rate&rdquo; means the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date on which the interest rate for the transaction is set, as published by the Bureau..<sup><a href="#1639c_1_target" name="1639c_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Points and fees</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;points and fees&rdquo; means points and fees as defined by section 1602(aa)(4) of this title (other than bona fide third party charges not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate of the creditor or mortgage originator).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) Unless 2 bona fide discount points have been excluded under subclause (I), up to and including 1 bona fide discount point payable by the consumer in connection with the mortgage, but only if the interest rate from which the mortgage's interest rate will be discounted does not exceed by more than 2 percentage points the average prime offer rate.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Bona fide discount points defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (ii), the term &ldquo;bona fide discount points&rdquo; means loan discount points which are knowingly paid by the consumer for the purpose of reducing, and which in fact result in a bona fide reduction of, the interest rate or time-price differential applicable to the mortgage.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Smaller loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Bureau shall prescribe rules adjusting the criteria under subparagraph (A)(vii) in order to permit lenders that extend smaller loans to meet the requirements of the presumption of compliance under paragraph (1).
