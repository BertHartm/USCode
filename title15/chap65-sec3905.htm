<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibited insurance policy coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The terms of any insurance policy provided by a risk retention group or purchased by a purchasing group shall not provide or be construed to provide insurance policy coverage prohibited generally by State statute or declared unlawful by the highest court of the State whose law applies to such policy.</p>
