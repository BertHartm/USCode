<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Evidentiary value; defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any registration issued under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or of a mark registered on the principal register provided by this chapter and owned by a party to an action shall be admissible in evidence and shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the registration subject to any conditions or limitations stated therein, but shall not preclude another person from proving any legal or equitable defense or defect, including those set forth in subsection (b) of this section, which might have been asserted if such mark had not been registered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incontestability; defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent that the right to use the registered mark has become incontestable under section 1065 of this title, the registration shall be conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce. Such conclusive evidence shall relate to the exclusive right to use the mark on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the affidavit filed under the provisions of section 1065 of this title, or in the renewal application filed under the provisions of section 1059 of this title if the goods or services specified in the renewal are fewer in number, subject to any conditions or limitations in the registration or in such affidavit or renewal application. Such conclusive evidence of the right to use the registered mark shall be subject to proof of infringement as defined in section 1114 of this title, and shall be subject to the following defenses or defects:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) That the registration or the incontestable right to use the mark was obtained fraudulently; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) That the mark has been abandoned by the registrant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That the registered mark is being used by or with the permission of the registrant or a person in privity with the registrant, so as to misrepresent the source of the goods or services on or in connection with which the mark is used; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) That the use of the name, term, or device charged to be an infringement is a use, otherwise than as a mark, of the party's individual name in his own business, or of the individual name of anyone in privity with such party, or of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party, or their geographic origin; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) That the mark whose use by a party is charged as an infringement was adopted without knowledge of the registrant's prior use and has been continuously used by such party or <!-- PDFPage:837 -->those in privity with him from a date prior to (A) the date of constructive use of the mark established pursuant to section 1057(c) of this title, (B) the registration of the mark under this chapter if the application for registration is filed before the effective date of the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, or (C) publication of the registered mark under subsection (c) of section 1062 of this title: <em>Provided, however</em>, That this defense or defect shall apply only for the area in which such continuous prior use is proved; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) That the mark whose use is charged as an infringement was registered and used prior to the registration under this chapter or publication under subsection (c) of section 1062 of this title of the registered mark of the registrant, and not abandoned: <em>Provided, however</em>, That this defense or defect shall apply only for the area in which the mark was used prior to such registration or such publication of the registrant's mark; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) That the mark has been or is being used to violate the antitrust laws of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) That equitable principles, including laches, estoppel, and acquiescence, are applicable.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Jurisdiction; service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The several courts vested with jurisdiction of civil actions arising under this chapter shall have power to grant injunctions, according to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court may deem reasonable, to prevent the violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office or to prevent a violation under section 1125(a) of this title. Any such injunction may include a provision directing the defendant to file with the court and serve on the plaintiff within thirty days after the service on the defendant of such injunction, or such extended period as the court may direct, a report in writing under oath setting forth in detail the manner and form in which the defendant has complied with the injunction. Any such injunction granted upon hearing, after notice to the defendant, by any district court of the United States, may be served on the parties against whom such injunction is granted anywhere in the United States where they may be found, and shall be operative and may be enforced by proceedings to punish <!-- PDFPage:838 -->for contempt, or otherwise, by the court by which such injunction was granted, or by any other United States district court in whose jurisdiction the defendant may be found.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfer of certified copies of court papers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The said courts shall have jurisdiction to enforce said injunction, as provided in this chapter, as fully as if the injunction had been granted by the district court in which it is sought to be enforced. The clerk of the court or judge granting the injunction shall, when required to do so by the court before which application to enforce said injunction is made, transfer without delay to said court a certified copy of all papers on file in his office upon which said injunction was granted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to Commissioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the clerks of such courts within one month after the filing of any action, suit, or proceeding involving a mark registered under the provisions of this chapter to give notice thereof in writing to the Commissioner setting forth in order so far as known the names and addresses of the litigants and the designating number or numbers of the registration or registrations upon which the action, suit, or proceeding has been brought, and in the event any other registration be subsequently included in the action, suit, or proceeding by amendment, answer, or other pleading, the clerk shall give like notice thereof to the Commissioner, and within one month after the judgment is entered or an appeal is taken the clerk of the court shall give notice thereof to the Commissioner, and it shall be the duty of the Commissioner on receipt of such notice forthwith to endorse the same upon the file wrapper of the said registration or registrations and to incorporate the same as a part of the contents of said file wrapper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil actions arising out of use of counterfeit marks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In the case of a civil action arising under section 1114(1)(a) of this title or section 380 of title 36 with respect to a violation that consists of using a counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services, the court may, upon ex parte application, grant an order under subsection (a) of this section pursuant to this subsection providing for the seizure of goods and counterfeit marks involved in such violation and the means of making such marks, and records documenting the manufacture, sale, or receipt of things involved in such violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) As used in this subsection the term &ldquo;counterfeit mark&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a counterfeit of a mark that is registered on the principal register in the United States Patent and Trademark Office for such goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed and that is in use, whether or not the person against whom relief is sought knew such mark was so registered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a spurious designation that is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a designation as to which the remedies of this chapter are made available by reason of section 380 of title 36;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but such term does not include any mark or designation used on or in connection with goods or services of which the manufacture or producer was, at the time of the manufacture or production in question authorized to use the mark or designation for the type of goods or services so manufactured or produced, by the holder of the right to use such mark or designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court shall not receive an application under this subsection unless the applicant has given such notice of the application as is reasonable under the circumstances to the United States attorney for the judicial district in which such order is sought. Such attorney may participate in the proceedings arising under such application if such proceedings may affect evidence of an offense against the United States. The court may deny such application if the court determines that the public interest in a potential prosecution so requires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The application for an order under this subsection shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be based on an affidavit or the verified complaint establishing facts sufficient to support the findings of fact and conclusions of law required for such order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contain the additional information required by paragraph (5) of this subsection to be set forth in such order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The court shall not grant such an application unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the person obtaining an order under this subsection provides the security determined adequate by the court for the payment of such damages as any person may be entitled to recover as a result of a wrongful seizure or wrongful attempted seizure under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the court finds that it clearly appears from specific facts that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) an order other than an ex parte seizure order is not adequate to achieve the purposes of section 1114 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the applicant has not publicized the requested seizure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the applicant is likely to succeed in showing that the person against whom seizure would be ordered used a counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) an immediate and irreparable injury will occur if such seizure is not ordered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) the matter to be seized will be located at the place identified in the application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) the harm to the applicant of denying the application outweighs the harm to the legitimate interests of the person against whom seizure would be ordered of granting the application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) the person against whom seizure would be ordered, or persons acting in concert with such person, would destroy, move, hide, or otherwise make such matter inaccessible to the court, if the applicant were to proceed on notice to such person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, or a violation under section 1125(a) of this title, shall have been established in any civil action arising under this chapter, the plaintiff shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of sections 1111 and 1114 of this title, and subject to the principles of equity, to recover (1) defendant's profits, (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action. The court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the same to be assessed under its direction. In assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant's sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed. In assessing damages the court may enter judgment, according to the circumstances of the case, for any sum above the amount found as actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount. If the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of the case. Such sum in either of the above circumstances shall constitute compensation and not a penalty. The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In assessing damages under subsection (a) of this section, the court shall, unless the court finds extenuating circumstances, enter judgment for three times such profits or damages, whichever is greater, together with a reasonable attorney's fee, in the case of any violation of section 1114(1)(a) of this title or section 380 of title 36 that consists of intentionally using a mark or designation, knowing such mark or designation is a counterfeit mark (as defined in section 1116(d) of this title), in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services. In such cases, the court may in its discretion award prejudgment interest on such amount at an annual interest rate established under section 6621 of title 26, commencing on the date of the service of the claimant's pleadings setting forth the claim for such entry and ending on the date such entry is made, or for such shorter time as the court deems appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prior registration in country of origin; country of origin defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No registration of a mark in the United States by a person described in subsection (b) of this section shall be granted until such mark has been registered in the country of origin of the applicant, unless the applicant alleges use in commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the country of origin of the applicant is the country in which he has a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment, or if he has not such an establishment the country in which he is domiciled, or if he has not a domicile in any of the countries described in subsection (b) of this section, the country of which he is a national.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">In like manner and subject to the same conditions and requirements, the right provided in this section may be based upon a subsequent regularly filed application in the same foreign country, instead of the first filed foreign application: <em>Provided</em>, That any foreign application filed prior to such subsequent application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of, without having been laid open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding, and has not served, nor thereafter shall serve, as a basis for claiming a right of priority.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A mark duly registered in the country of origin of the foreign applicant may be registered on the principal register if eligible, otherwise on the supplemental register in this chapter provided.

Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining abandonment under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;colorable imitation&rdquo; includes any mark which so resembles a registered mark as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.</p>

<p class="futureamend-note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;465, title V, &sect;&sect;521, 523, Dec. 8, 1994, 108 Stat. 4981, 4982, provided that, effective one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States (Jan. 1, 1995), this section is amended by amending the par. defining &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; to read as follows:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="italic-text-para">A mark shall be deemed to be &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; if either of the following occurs:</p>
<p class="italic-text-para-1em">(1) When its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment. &ldquo;Use&rdquo; of a mark means the bona fide use of such mark made in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para-1em">(2) When any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to become the generic name for the goods or services on or in connection with which it is used or otherwise to lose its significance as a mark. Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining abandonment under this paragraph.</p>
