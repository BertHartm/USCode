<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by any such officer or director by reason of his relationship to such registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof, any profit realized by any such officer or director from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any security of such registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof within any period of less than six months, unless such security was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, shall inure to and be recoverable by the holding company or subsidiary company in respect of the security of which such profit was realized, irrespective of any intention on the part of such officer or director in entering into such transaction to hold the security purchased or not to repurchase the security sold for a period of more than six months. Suit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the company entitled thereto or by the owner of any security of such company in the name and in the behalf of such company if such company shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized. This subsection shall not cover any transaction where such person was not an officer or director at the times of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved, or any transaction or transactions which the Commission by rules and regulations may, as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to give a remedy in the case of any transaction in respect of which a remedy is given under subsection (b) of section 78p of this title.</p>
