<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Priority activities and projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall support eligible activities contained in State applications with the full amount of available funds. In the event that State applications for funds exceed the total funds available in a fiscal year, the Administrator shall give priority to activities or projects proposed by States based on each of the following criteria:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Information</h4>
