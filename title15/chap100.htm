<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Revolutionary advancements in computing and communications technology have interconnected government, commercial, scientific, and educational infrastructures&mdash;including critical infrastructures for electric power, natural gas and petroleum production and distribution, telecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking and finance, and emergency and government services&mdash;in a vast, interdependent physical and electronic network.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Exponential increases in interconnectivity have facilitated enhanced com<!-- PDFPage:1815 -->munications, economic growth, and the delivery of services critical to the public welfare, but have also increased the consequences of temporary or prolonged failure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A Department of Defense Joint Task Force concluded after a 1997 United States information warfare exercise that the results &ldquo;clearly demonstrated our lack of preparation for a coordinated cyber and physical attack on our critical military and civilian infrastructure&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Computer security technology and systems implementation lack&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sufficient long term research funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adequate coordination across Federal and State government agencies and among government, academia, and industry; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sufficient numbers of outstanding researchers in the field.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Accordingly, Federal investment in computer and network security research and development must be significantly increased to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) improve vulnerability assessment and technological and systems solutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expand and improve the pool of information security professionals, including researchers, in the United States workforce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) better coordinate information sharing and collaboration among industry, government, and academic research projects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) While African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans constitute 25 percent of the total United States workforce and 30 percent of the college-age population, members of these minorities comprise less than 7 percent of the United States computer and information science workforce.</p>
