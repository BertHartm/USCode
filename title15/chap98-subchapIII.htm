<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rulemaking authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, issue rules to clarify the application of this subsection and to prevent evasion thereof.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Individual account plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;individual account plan&rdquo; has the meaning provided in section 1002(34) of title 29, except that such term shall not include a one-participant retirement plan (within the meaning of section 1021(i)(8)(B) of title 29).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notice to directors, executive officers, and the Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which a director or executive officer is subject to the requirements of this subsection in connection with a blackout period (as defined in paragraph (4)) with respect to any equity securities, the issuer of such equity securities shall timely notify such director or officer and the Securities and Exchange Commission of such blackout period.</p>

Not later than 75 days after July 30, 2002, the Secretary shall promulgate interim final rules necessary to carry out the amendments made by this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Plan amendments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during the period after such amendment made by this subsection takes effect <!-- PDFPage:2012 -->and before such first plan year, the plan is operated in good faith compliance with the requirements of such amendment made by this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such plan amendment applies retroactively to the period after such amendment made by this subsection takes effect and before such first plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section (including the amendments made thereby) shall take effect 180 days after July 30, 2002.
