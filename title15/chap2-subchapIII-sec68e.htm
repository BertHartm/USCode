Proceedings in such libel cases shall conform as nearly as may be to suits in rem in admiralty, and may be brought by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If such wool products are condemned by the court, they shall be disposed of, in the discretion of the court, by destruction; by sale; by delivery to the owner or claimant thereof upon payment of legal costs and charges and upon execution of good and sufficient bond to the effect that such wool products will not be disposed of until properly stamped, tagged, labeled, or otherwise identified under the provisions of this subchapter; or by such charitable disposition as the court may deem proper. If such wool products are disposed of by sale, the proceeds, less legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Grounds for temporary injunction or restraining order; issuance without bond</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It would be to the public interest to enjoin such violation until complaint is issued by the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] and such complaint dismissed by the Commission or set aside by the court on review, or until order to cease and desist made thereon by the Commission has become final within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission may bring suit in the district court of the United States or in the United States court of any Territory, for the district or Territory in which such person resides or transacts business, to enjoin such violation, and upon proper showing a temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.</p>
