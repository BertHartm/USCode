<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Statement of registration under securities provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be construed to prohibit a statement that a person or security is registered under this chapter, the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.], or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.], if such statement is true in fact and if the effect of such registration is not misrepresented.</p>

The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district court of the United States or United States court of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States alleging that the name or title of any registered investment company, or of any security which it has issued, is materially deceptive or misleading. If the court finds that the Commission's allegations in this respect, taking into consideration the history of the investment company and the length of time which it may have used any such name or title, are established, the court shall enjoin such investment company from continuing to use any such name or title.</p>
