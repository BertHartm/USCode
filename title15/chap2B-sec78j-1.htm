<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each audit required pursuant to this chapter of the financial statements of an issuer by a registered public accounting firm shall include, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented from time to time by the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) procedures designed to identify related party transactions that are material to the financial statements or otherwise require disclosure therein; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt about the ability of the issuer to continue as a going concern during the ensuing fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required response to audit discoveries</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Investigation and report to management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the course of conducting an audit pursuant to this chapter to which subsection (a) of this section applies, the registered public accounting firm detects or otherwise becomes aware of information indicating that an illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a material effect on the financial statements of the issuer) has or may have occurred, the firm shall, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented from time to time by the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) determine whether it is likely that an illegal act has occurred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if so, determine and consider the possible effect of the illegal act on the financial statements of the issuer, including any contingent monetary effects, such as fines, penalties, and damages; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as soon as practicable, inform the appropriate level of the management of the issuer and assure that the audit committee of the issuer, or the board of directors of the issuer in the absence of such a committee, is adequately informed with respect to illegal acts that have been detected or have otherwise come to the attention of such firm in the course of the audit, unless the illegal act is clearly inconsequential.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Response to failure to take remedial action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after determining that the audit committee of the board of directors of the issuer, or the board of directors of the issuer in the absence of an audit committee, is adequately informed with respect to illegal acts that have been detected or have otherwise come to the attention of the firm in the course of the audit of such firm, the registered public accounting firm concludes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the illegal act has a material effect on the financial statements of the issuer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the senior management has not taken, and the board of directors has not caused senior management to take, timely and appropriate remedial actions with respect to the illegal act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure to take remedial action is reasonably expected to warrant departure from a standard report of the auditor, when made, or warrant resignation from the audit engagement;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the registered public accounting firm shall, as soon as practicable, directly report its conclusions to the board of directors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice to Commission; response to failure to notify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer whose board of directors receives a report under paragraph (2) shall inform the Commission by notice not later than 1 business day after the receipt of such report and shall furnish the registered public accounting firm making such report with a copy of the notice furnished to the Commission. If the registered public accounting firm fails to receive a copy of the notice before the expiration of the required 1-business-day period, the registered public accounting firm shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) resign from the engagement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) furnish to the Commission a copy of its report (or the documentation of any oral report given) not later than 1 business day following such failure to receive notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report after resignation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a registered public accounting firm resigns from an engagement under paragraph (3)(A), the firm shall, not later than 1 business day following the failure by the issuer to notify the Commission under paragraph (3), furnish to the Commission a copy of the report of the firm (or the documentation of any oral report given).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Auditor liability limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No registered public accounting firm shall be liable in a private action for any finding, conclusion, or statement expressed in a report made pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b) of this section, including any rule promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil penalties in cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in a proceeding instituted pursuant to section 78u&ndash;3 of this title, that a registered public accounting firm has willfully violated paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b) of this section, the Commission may, in addition to entering an order under section 78u&ndash;3 of this title, impose a civil penalty against the registered public accounting firm and any other person that the Commission finds was a cause of such violation. The determination to impose a civil penalty and the amount of the penalty shall be governed by the standards set forth in section 78u&ndash;2 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Preservation of existing authority</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A registered public accounting firm may engage in any non-audit service, including tax services, that is not described in any of paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection (g) of this section for an audit client, only if the activity is approved in advance by the audit committee of the issuer, in accordance with subsection (i) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Preapproval requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Audit committee action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All auditing services (which may entail providing comfort letters in connection with securities underwritings or statutory audits required for insurance companies for purposes of State law) and non-audit services, other than as provided in subparagraph (B), provided to an issuer by the auditor of the issuer shall be preapproved by the audit committee of the issuer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the audit committee of the issuer and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the audit committee or by 1 or more members of the audit committee who are members of the board of directors to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the audit committee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disclosure to investors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Approval by an audit committee of an issuer under this subsection of a non-audit service to be performed by the auditor of the issuer shall be disclosed to investors in periodic reports required by section 78m(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Delegation authority</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports to audit committees</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) other material written communications between the registered public accounting firm <!-- PDFPage:206 -->and the management of the issuer, such as any management letter or schedule of unadjusted differences.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Conflicts of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to perform for an issuer any audit service required by this chapter, if a chief executive officer, controller, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, or any person serving in an equivalent position for the issuer, was employed by that registered independent public accounting firm and participated in any capacity in the audit of that issuer during the 1-year period preceding the date of the initiation of the audit.</p>
