<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each audit required pursuant to this chapter of the financial statements of an issuer by an independent public accountant shall include, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented from time to time by the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) procedures designed to identify related party transactions that are material to the financial statements or otherwise require disclosure therein; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt about the ability of the issuer to continue as a going concern during the ensuing fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required response to audit discoveries</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Investigation and report to management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the course of conducting an audit pursuant to this chapter to which subsection (a) of this section applies, the independent public accountant detects or otherwise becomes aware of information indicating that an illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a material effect on the financial statements of the issuer) has or may have occurred, the accountant shall, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented from time to time by the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) determine whether it is likely that an illegal act has occurred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if so, determine and consider the possible effect of the illegal act on the financial statements of the issuer, including any contingent monetary effects, such as fines, penalties, and damages; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as soon as practicable, inform the appropriate level of the management of the issuer and assure that the audit committee of the issuer, or the board of directors of the issuer in the absence of such a committee, is adequately informed with respect to illegal acts that have been detected or have otherwise come to the attention of such accountant in the course of the audit, unless the illegal act is clearly inconsequential.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Response to failure to take remedial action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after determining that the audit committee of the board of directors of the issuer, or the board of directors of the issuer in the absence of an audit committee, is adequately informed with respect to illegal acts that have been detected or have otherwise come to the attention of the accountant in the course of the audit of such accountant, the independent public accountant concludes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the illegal act has a material effect on the financial statements of the issuer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the senior management has not taken, and the board of directors has not caused senior management to take, timely and appropriate remedial actions with respect to the illegal act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure to take remedial action is reasonably expected to warrant departure from a standard report of the auditor, when made, or warrant resignation from the audit engagement;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the independent public accountant shall, as soon as practicable, directly report its conclusions to the board of directors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice to Commission; response to failure to notify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer whose board of directors receives a report under paragraph (2) shall inform the Commission by notice not later than 1 business day after the receipt of such report and shall furnish the independent public accountant making such report with a copy of the notice furnished to the Commission. If the independent public accountant fails to receive a copy of the notice before the expiration of the required 1-business-day period, the independent public accountant shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) resign from the engagement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) furnish to the Commission a copy of its report (or the documentation of any oral report given) not later than 1 business day following such failure to receive notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report after resignation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an independent public accountant resigns from an engagement under paragraph (3)(A), the accountant shall, not later than 1 business day following the failure by the issuer to notify the Commission under paragraph (3), furnish to the Commission a copy of the accountant's report (or the documentation of any oral report given).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Auditor liability limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No independent public accountant shall be liable in a private action for any finding, conclusion, or statement expressed in a report made pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b) of this section, including any rule promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil penalties in cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in a proceeding instituted pursuant to section 78u&ndash;3 of this title, that an independent public accountant has willfully violated paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b) of this section, the Commission may, in addition to entering an order under section 78u&ndash;3 of this title, <!-- PDFPage:205 -->impose a civil penalty against the independent public accountant and any other person that the Commission finds was a cause of such violation. The determination to impose a civil penalty and the amount of the penalty shall be governed by the standards set forth in section 78u&ndash;2 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Preservation of existing authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, nothing in this section shall be held to limit or otherwise affect the authority of the Commission under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Illegal act&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;illegal act&rdquo; means an act or omission that violates any law, or any rule or regulation having the force of law.</p>
