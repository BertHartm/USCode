<p class="note-body">This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original &ldquo;This Act&rdquo;. The act was divided into two titles as follows: &ldquo;Title I&mdash;Regulation of Securities Exchanges&rdquo; and &ldquo;Title II&mdash;Amendments to Securities Act of 1933.&rdquo; This section was section 1 of title I, which title is set out as sections 78a to 78h, 78i to 78<em>l</em>, 78m to 78<em>o</em>, 78<em>o</em>&ndash;3 to 78dd&ndash;1, and 78ee to 78mm of this title. Title II of the act amended or repealed sections 77b to 77e, 77j, 77k, 77m, 77<em>o</em>, and 77s, and added former sections 78ii and 78jj of this title. Although these latter provisions were set out as a separate title, they were part of the act; hence, they are technically a part of the &ldquo;Securities Exchange Act of 1934&rdquo;.</p>
