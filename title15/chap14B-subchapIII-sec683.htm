<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Debentures and participating securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To encourage the formation and growth of small business investment companies the Ad<!-- PDFPage:670 -->ministration is authorized (but only to the extent that the necessary funds are not available to said company from private sources on reasonable terms) when authorized in appropriation Acts, to purchase, or to guarantee the timely payment of all principal and interest as scheduled on, debentures or participating securities issued by such companies. Such purchases or guarantees may be made by the Administration on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, pursuant to regulations issued by the Administration. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee under this subsection. Debentures purchased or guaranteed by the Administration under this subsection shall be subordinate to any other debenture bonds, promissory notes, or other debts and obligations of such companies, unless the Administration in its exercise of reasonable investment prudence and in considering the financial soundness of such company determines otherwise. Such debentures may be issued for a term of not to exceed fifteen years and shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such debentures, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus such additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Administration may determine to be consistent with its purposes. The debentures or participating securities shall also contain such other terms as the Administration may fix, and shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The total amount of debentures and participating securities that may be guaranteed by the Administration and outstanding from a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title shall not exceed 300 per centum of the private capital of such company: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this paragraph shall require any such company that on March 31, 1993, has outstanding debentures in excess of 300 per centum of its private capital to prepay such excess: <em>And provided further</em>, That any such company may apply for an additional debenture guarantee or participating security guarantee with the proceeds to be used solely to pay the amount due on such maturing debenture, but the maturity of the new debenture or security shall be not later than September 30, 2002.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) After March 31, 1993, the maximum amount of outstanding leverage made available to a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title shall be determined by the amount of such company's private capital&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;venture capital&rdquo; includes such common stock, preferred stock, or other financing with subordination or nonamortization characteristics as the Administration determines to be substantially similar to equity financing.</p>

Such payments shall be made by the Administration to the holder of the debenture, its agents or assigns, or to the appropriate central registration agent, if any. The authority to reduce interest rates as provided in this subsection shall be limited to amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts, and the total amount shall be reserved within the business loan and investment fund to pay an amount equal to the amount of the reduction as it becomes due.</p>

The Administration, in its sole discretion, shall determine the repurchase price after considering factors including, but not limited to, the market value of the stock, the value of benefits previously provided and anticipated to accrue to the issuer, the amount of dividends previously paid, accrued, and anticipated, and the Administration's estimate of any anticipated redemption. The Administration may guarantee debentures as provided in paragraph (5) of subsection (c) of this section and allow the issuer to use the proceeds to make the payments authorized herein. Any monies received by the Administration from the repurchase of preferred stock shall be deposited in the business loan and investment fund and shall be available solely to provide assistance to companies operating under the authority of section 681(d) of this title, to the extent and in the amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts.</p>

Such guarantees and purchases shall be made on such terms and conditions as the Administration shall establish by regulation. For purposes of this section, (A) the term &ldquo;participating securities&rdquo; includes preferred stock, a preferred limited partnership interest or a similar instrument, including debentures under the terms of which interest is payable only to the extent of earnings and (B) the term &ldquo;prioritized payments&rdquo; includes dividends on stock, interest on qualifying debentures, or priority returns on preferred limited partnership interests which are paid only to the extent of earnings.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Prioritized payments on participating securities shall be preferred and cumulative and payable out of the retained earnings available for distribution, as defined by the Administration, of the issuing company at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such securities, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus, at the time the guarantee is issued, such additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Administration may determine to be consistent with its purposes, but not to exceed 2 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In the event of liquidation of the company, participating securities shall be senior in priority for all purposes to all other equity interests in the issuing company, whenever created.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any company issuing a participating security under this subsection shall commit to invest or shall invest and maintain an amount equal to the outstanding face value of such security solely in equity capital.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Administration may permit the proceeds of a participating security to be used to pay the principal amount due on outstanding debentures guaranteed by the Administration, if (A) the company has outstanding equity capital invested in an amount equal to the amount of the debentures being refinanced and (B) the Administration receives profit participation on such terms and conditions as it may determine, but not to exceed the per centums specified in paragraph (11).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) For purposes of computing profit participation under paragraph (11), except as otherwise determined by the Administration, the management expenses of any company which issues participating securities shall not be greater than 2.5 per centum per annum of the combined capital of the company, plus $125,000 if the company's combined capital is less than $20,000,000. For purposes of this paragraph, (A) the term &ldquo;combined capital&rdquo; means the aggregate amount of private capital and outstanding leverage and (B) the term &ldquo;management expenses&rdquo; includes salaries, office expenses, travel, business development, office and equipment rental, bookkeeping and the development, investigation and monitoring of investments, but does not include the cost of services provided by specialized outside consultants, outside lawyers and outside auditors, who perform services not generally expected of a venture capital company nor does such term include the cost of services provided by any affiliate of the company which are not part of the normal process of making and monitoring venture capital investments.</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;State income tax&rdquo; means the income tax of the State where the company's principal place of business is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) After making any distributions as provided in paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may distribute the balance of income to its investors, specifically including the Administration, in the per centums specified in paragraph (11), if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, any amounts distributed shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of leverage to private capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 100 per centum but not more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, 50 per centum of any amounts distributed shall be made to the Administration and 50 per centum shall be made to the private investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If the amount of leverage outstanding is 100 per centum, or less, of the amount of private capital, the ratio shall be that for distribution of profits as provided in paragraph (11).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any amounts received by the Administration under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be applied first as profit participation as provided in paragraph (11) and any remainder shall be applied as a prepayment of the principal amount of the participating securities or debentures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) After making any distributions pursuant to paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may return capital to its investors, specifically including the Administration, if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full. Any distributions under this paragraph shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of private capital to leverage as of the date of the proposed distribution: <em>Provided</em>, That if the amount of leverage outstanding is less than 50 per centum of the amount of private capital or $10,000,000, whichever is less, no distribution shall be required to be made to the Administration unless the Administration determines, on a case by case basis, to require distributions to the Administration to reduce the amount of outstanding leverage to an amount less than $10,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11)(A) A company which issues participating securities shall agree to allocate to the Administration a share of its profits determined by the relationship of its private capital to the amount of participating securities guaranteed by the Administration in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If the total amount of participating securities is 100 per centum of private capital or less, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows: the amount of participating securities divided by private capital times 9 per centum.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:674 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If the total amount of participating securities is more than 100 per centum but not greater than 200 per centum of private capital, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) 9 per centum, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) 3 per centum of the amount of participating securities minus private capital divided by private capital.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in no event shall the total per centum required by this paragraph exceed 12 per centum, unless required pursuant to the provisions of (ii) below,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if, on the date the participating securities are marketed, the interest rate on Treasury bonds with a maturity of 10 years is a rate other than 8 per centum, the Administration shall adjust the rate specified in paragraph (A) above, either higher or lower, by the same per centum by which the Treasury bond rate is higher or lower than 8 per centum, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) this paragraph shall not be construed to create any ownership interest of the Administration in the company.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) A company may elect to make an in-kind distribution of securities only if such securities are publicly traded and marketable. The company shall deposit the Administration's share of such securities for disposition with a trustee designated by the Administration or, at its option and with the agreement of the company, the Administration may direct the company to retain the Administration's share. If the company retains the Administration's share, it shall sell the Administration's share and promptly remit the proceeds to the Administration. As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; means a person who is knowledgeable about and proficient in the marketing of thinly traded securities.</p>
