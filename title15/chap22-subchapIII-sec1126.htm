<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Register of marks communicated by international bureaus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall keep a register of all marks communicated to him by the international bureaus provided for by the conventions for the protection of industrial property, trademarks, trade and commercial names, and the repression of unfair competition to which the United States is or may become a party, and upon the payment of the fees required by such conventions and the fees required in this chapter may place the marks so communicated upon such register. This register shall show a facsimile of the mark or trade or commercial name; the name, citizenship, and address of the registrant; the number, date, and place of the first registration of the mark, including the dates on which application for such registration was filed and granted and the term of such registration; a list of goods or services to which the mark is applied as shown by the registration in the country of origin, and such other data as may be useful concerning the mark. This register shall be a continuation of the register provided in section 1(a) of the Act of March 19, 1920.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Benefits of section to persons whose country of origin is party to convention or treaty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person whose country of origin is a party to any convention or treaty relating to trademarks, trade or commercial names, or the repression of unfair competition, to which the United States is also a party, or extends reciprocal rights to nationals of the United States by law, shall be entitled to the benefits of this section under the conditions expressed herein to the extent necessary to give effect to any provision of such convention, treaty or reciprocal law, in addition to the rights to which any owner of a mark is otherwise entitled by this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prior registration in country of origin; country of origin defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No registration of a mark in the United States by a person described in subsection (b) of this section shall be granted until such mark has been registered in the country of origin of the applicant, unless the applicant alleges use in commerce.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1143 --><p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the country of origin of the applicant is the country in which he has a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment, or if he has not such an establishment the country in which he is domiciled, or if he has not a domicile in any of the countries described in subsection (b) of this section, the country of which he is a national.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Right of priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An application for registration of a mark under section 1051, 1053, 1054, or 1091 of this title or under subsection (e) of this section, filed by a person described in subsection (b) of this section who has previously duly filed an application for registration of the same mark in one of the countries described in subsection (b) of this section shall be accorded the same force and effect as would be accorded to the same application if filed in the United States on the same date on which the application was first filed in such foreign country: <em>Provided</em>, That&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the application in the United States is filed within six months from the date on which the application was first filed in the foreign country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the application conforms as nearly as practicable to the requirements of this chapter, including a statement that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the rights acquired by third parties before the date of the filing of the first application in the foreign country shall in no way be affected by a registration obtained on an application filed under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) nothing in this subsection shall entitle the owner of a registration granted under this section to sue for acts committed prior to the date on which his mark was registered in this country unless the registration is based on use in commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">In like manner and subject to the same conditions and requirements, the right provided in this section may be based upon a subsequent regularly filed application in the same foreign country, instead of the first filed foreign application: <em>Provided</em>, That any foreign application filed prior to such subsequent application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of, without having been laid open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding, and has not served, nor thereafter shall serve, as a basis for claiming a right of priority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Registration on principal or supplemental register; copy of foreign registration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mark duly registered in the country of origin of the foreign applicant may be registered on the principal register if eligible, otherwise on the supplemental register in this chapter provided. Such applicant shall submit, within such time period as may be prescribed by the Director, a true copy, a photocopy, a certification, or a certified copy of the registration in the country of origin of the applicant. The application must state the applicant's bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce, but use in commerce shall not be required prior to registration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Domestic registration independent of foreign registration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The registration of a mark under the provisions of subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section by a person described in subsection (b) of this section shall be independent of the registration in the country of origin and the duration, validity, or transfer in the United States of such registration shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Trade or commercial names of foreign nationals protected without registration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Trade names or commercial names of persons described in subsection (b) of this section shall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration whether or not they form parts of marks.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Protection of foreign nationals against unfair competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person designated in subsection (b) of this section as entitled to the benefits and subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be entitled to effective protection against unfair competition, and the remedies provided in this chapter for infringement of marks shall be available so far as they may be appropriate in repressing acts of unfair competition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Citizens or residents of United States entitled to benefits of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Citizens or residents of the United States shall have the same benefits as are granted by this section to persons described in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
