<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Registration of all persons utilizing exchange facilities to effect transactions; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer which is either a person other than a natural person or a natural person not associated with a broker or dealer which is a person other than a natural person (other than such a broker or dealer whose business is exclusively intrastate and who does not make use of any facility of a national securities exchange) to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transactions in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exempted security or commercial paper, bankers&rsquo; acceptances, or commercial bills) unless such broker or dealer is registered in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule or order, as it deems consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt from paragraph (1) of this subsection any broker or dealer or class of brokers or dealers specified in such rule or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Manner of registration of brokers and dealers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A broker or dealer may be registered by filing with the Commission an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents concerning such broker or dealer and any persons associated with such broker or dealer as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Within forty-five days of the date of the filing of such application (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by order grant registration, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred twenty days of the date of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The order granting registration shall not be effective until such broker or dealer has become a member of a registered securities association, or until such broker or dealer has become a member of a national securities exchange if such broker or dealer effects transactions solely on that exchange, unless the Commission has exempted such broker or dealer, by rule or order, from such membership. The Commission may extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to ninety days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the applicant consents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall grant such registration if the Commission finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied. The Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such a finding or if it finds that if the applicant were so registered, its registration would be subject to suspension or revocation under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An application for registration of a broker or dealer to be formed or organized may be made by a broker or dealer to which the broker or dealer to be formed or organized is to be the successor. Such application, in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, shall contain such information and documents concerning the applicant, the successor, and any persons associated with the applicant or the successor, as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The grant or denial of registration to such an applicant shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the Commission grants such registration, the registration shall terminate on the forty-fifth day after the effective date thereof, unless prior thereto the successor shall, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, adopt the application for registration as its own.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person who is a broker or dealer solely by reason of acting as a municipal securities dealer or municipal securities broker, who so acts through a separately identifiable department or division, and who so acted in such a manner on June 4, 1975, may, in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Commission, by rule, prescribes as necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, register such separately identifiable department or division in accordance with this subsection. If any such department or division is so registered, the department or division and not such person himself shall be the broker or dealer for purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Within six months of the date of the granting of registration to a broker or dealer, the Commission, or upon the authorization and direction of the Commission, a registered securities association or national securities exchange of which such broker or dealer is a member, shall conduct an inspection of the broker or dealer to determine whether it is operating in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Commission may delay such inspection of any class of brokers or dealers for a period not to exceed six months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any provision of this chapter (other than section 78e of this title and subsection (a) of this section) which prohibits any act, practice, or <!-- PDFPage:236 -->course of business if the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce is used in connection therewith shall also prohibit any such act, practice, or course of business by any registered broker or dealer or any person acting on behalf of such a broker or dealer, irrespective of any use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection therewith.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations on the activities, functions, or operations of, suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of any broker or dealer if it finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or revocation is in the public interest and that such broker or dealer, whether prior or subsequent to becoming such, or any person associated with such broker or dealer, whether prior or subsequent to becoming so associated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has willfully made or caused to be made in any application for registration or report required to be filed with the Commission or with any other appropriate regulatory agency under this chapter, or in any proceeding before the Commission with respect to registration, any statement which was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or has omitted to state in any such application or report any material fact which is required to be stated therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has been convicted within ten years preceding the filing of any application for registration or at any time thereafter of any felony or misdemeanor or of a substantially equivalent crime by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction which the Commission finds&mdash;</p>

For the purposes of this subparagraph (E) no person shall be deemed to have failed reasonably to supervise any other person, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) there have been established procedures, and a system for applying such procedures, which would reasonably be expected to prevent and detect, insofar as practicable, any such violation by such other person, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such person has reasonably discharged the duties and obligations incumbent upon him by reason of such procedures and system without reasonable cause to believe that such procedures and system were not being complied with.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Pending final determination whether any registration under this subsection shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Any registered broker or dealer may, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with the Commission. If the Commission finds that any registered broker or dealer is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a broker or dealer, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the registration of such broker or dealer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) With respect to any person who is associated, who is seeking to become associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, who was associated or was seeking to become associated with a broker or dealer, or any person participating, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, who was participating, in an offering of any penny stock, the Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations on the activities or functions of such person, or suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or bar such person from being associated with a broker or dealer, or from participating in an offering of penny stock, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or bar is in the public interest and that such person&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify that all or any portion of such standards shall be applicable to any class of brokers and dealers and persons associated with brokers and dealers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require persons in any such class to pass tests prescribed in accordance with such rules and regulations, which tests shall, with respect to any class of partners, officers, or supervisory employees (which latter term may be defined by the Commission's rules and regulations and as so defined shall include branch managers of brokers or dealers) engaged in the management of the broker or dealer, include questions relating to bookkeeping, accounting, internal control over cash and securities, supervision of employees, maintenance of records, and other appropriate matters; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Penny Stock Reform; Congressional Statement of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 502 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;429 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The maintenance of an honest and healthy primary and secondary market for securities offerings is essential to enhancing long-term capital formation and economic growth and providing legitimate investment opportunities for individuals and institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Protecting investors in new securities is a critical component in the maintenance of an honest and healthy market for such securities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Protecting issuers of new securities and promoting the capital formation process on behalf of small companies are fundamental concerns in maintaining a strong economy and viable trading markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Unscrupulous market practices and market participants have pervaded the &lsquo;penny stock&rsquo; market with an overwhelming amount of fraud and abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Although the Securities and Exchange Commission, State securities regulators, and securities self-regulators have made efforts to curb these abusive and harmful practices, the penny stock market still lacks an adequate and sufficient regulatory structure, particularly in comparison to the structure for overseeing trading in National Market System securities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Investors in the penny stock market suffer from a serious lack of adequate information concerning price and volume of penny stock transactions, the nature of this market, and the specific securities in which they are investing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Current practices do not adequately regulate the role of &lsquo;promoters&rsquo; and &lsquo;consultants&rsquo; in the penny stock market, and many professionals who have been banned from the securities markets have ended up in promoter and consultant roles, contributing substantially to fraudulent and abusive schemes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The present regulatory environment has permitted the ascendancy of the use of particular market practices, such as &lsquo;reverse mergers&rsquo; with shell corporations and &lsquo;blank check&rsquo; offerings, which are used to facilitate manipulation schemes and harm investors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) In light of the substantial and continuing problems in the penny stock markets, additional legislative measures are necessary and appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Revision of Sanction Authority With Respect to Penny Stocks; Recommendations to Congress</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 504(b) of Pub. L. 101&ndash;429 provided that: &ldquo;Within 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 15, 1990], the Securities and Exchange Commission shall submit to each House of the Congress such recommendations as the Commission considers appropriate with respect to further revision of section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78<em>o</em>(b)(6)). In preparing such recommendations, the Commission shall consider the desirability and effect of expanding the applicability of such section to any promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer, or issuer for purposes of the issuance of or trading in, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (and not just penny stock).&rdquo;</p>
