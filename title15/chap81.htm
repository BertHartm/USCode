<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Advances in computer science and technology are vital to the Nation's prosperity, national and economic security, industrial production, engineering, and scientific advancement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The United States currently leads the world in the development and use of high-performance computing for national security, industrial productivity, science, and engineering, but that lead is being challenged by foreign competitors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Further research and development, expanded educational programs, improved computer research networks, and more effective technology transfer from government to industry are necessary for the United States to reap fully the benefits of high-performance computing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A high-capacity and high-speed national research and education computer network would provide researchers and educators with access to computer and information resources and act as a test bed for further research and development of high-capacity and high-speed computer networks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Several Federal agencies have ongoing high-performance computing programs, but improved long-term interagency coordination, cooperation, and planning would enhance the effectiveness of these programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A 1991 report entitled &ldquo;Grand Challenges: High-Performance Computing and Communications&rdquo; by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlining a research and development strategy for high-performance computing, provides a framework for a multiagency high-performance computing program. Such a program would provide American researchers and educators with the computer and information resources they need, and demonstrate how advanced computers, high-capacity and high-speed networks, and electronic data bases can improve the national information infrastructure for use by all Americans.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As part of the Program, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other agencies participating in the Program shall support the establishment of the National Research and Education Network, portions of which shall, to the extent technically feasible, be capable of transmitting data at one gigabit per second or greater by 1996. The Network shall provide for the linkage of research institutions and educational institutions, government, and industry in every State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Federal agencies and departments shall work with private network service providers, State and local agencies, libraries, educational institutions and organizations, and others, as appropriate, in order to ensure that the researchers, educators, and students have access, as appropriate, to the Network. The Network is to provide users with appropriate access to high-performance computing systems, electronic information resources, other research facilities, and <!-- PDFPage:1412 -->libraries. The Network shall provide access, to the extent practicable, to electronic information resources maintained by libraries, research facilities, publishers, and affiliated organizations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) be designed, developed, and operated in a manner which promotes research and development leading to development of commercial data communications and telecommunications standards, whose development will encourage the establishment of privately operated high-speed commercial networks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) be designed and operated so as to ensure the continued application of laws that provide network and information resources security measures, including those that protect copyright and other intellectual property rights, and those that control access to data bases and protect national security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) have accounting mechanisms which allow users or groups of users to be charged for their usage of copyrighted materials available over the Network and, where appropriate and technically feasible, for their usage of the Network;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) ensure the interoperability of Federal and non-Federal computer networks, to the extent appropriate, in a way that allows autonomy for each component network;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) be developed by purchasing standard commercial transmission and network services from vendors whenever feasible, and by contracting for customized services when not feasible, in order to minimize Federal investment in network hardware;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) support research and development of networking software and hardware; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) serve as a test bed for further research and development of high-capacity and high-speed computing networks and demonstrate how advanced computers, high-capacity and high-speed computing networks, and data bases can improve the national information infrastructure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency responsibility</h4>

These services may include the provision of directories of the users and services on computer networks, data bases of unclassified Federal scientific data, training of users of data bases and computer networks, access to commercial information services for users of the Network, and technology to support computer-based collaboration that allows researchers and educators around the Nation to share information and instrumentation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Use of grant funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All Federal agencies and departments are authorized to allow recipients of Federal research grants to use grant moneys to pay for computer networking expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within one year after December 9, 1991, the Director shall report to the Congress on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) effective mechanisms for providing operating funds for the maintenance and use of the Network, including user fees, industry support, and continued Federal investment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the future operation and evolution of the Network;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) how commercial information service providers could be charged for access to the Network, and how Network users could be charged for such commercial information services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the technological feasibility of allowing commercial information service providers to use the Network and other federally funded research networks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) how to protect the copyrights of material distributed over the Network; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) appropriate policies to ensure the security of resources available on the Network and to protect the privacy of users of networks.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) High-performance computing and associated technologies are critical to the United States economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) While the United States has led the development of high-performance computing, United States industry is facing increasing global competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite existing international agreements on fair competition and nondiscrimination in government procurements, there is increasing concern that such agreements are not being honored, that more aggressive enforcement of such agreements is needed, and that additional steps may be required to ensure fair global competition, particularly in high-technology fields such as high-performance computing and associated technologies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It is appropriate for Federal agencies and departments to use the funds authorized for the Program in a manner which most effectively fosters the maintenance and development of United States leadership in high-performance computers and associated technologies in and for the benefit of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) It is appropriate for Federal agencies and departments to use the funds authorized for the Program in a manner, consistent with the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.), which most effectively fosters reciprocal competitive procurement treatment by foreign governments for United States high-performance computing and associated technology products and suppliers.</p>
