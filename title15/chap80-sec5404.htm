<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No fastener shall be offered for sale or sold in commerce unless it is part of a lot which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conforms to the standards and specifications to which the manufacturer represents it has been manufactured; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has been inspected, tested, and certified as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall not apply to fasteners which are part of a lot of 50 fasteners or less if, within 10 working days after the delivery of such fasteners, or as soon as practicable thereafter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) inspection, testing, and certification as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section is carried out; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) written notice detailing the results of such inspection, testing, and certification is sent (I) to all purchasers of such fasteners, except retail sellers and retail consumers, and (II) to any retail seller or retail consumer who, prior to delivery, requests such written notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a fastener is sold under this paragraph, each purchaser of such fastener, except for retail sellers and retail consumers unless such retail sellers and retail consumers request such notice in advance, shall be provided, contemporaneously with each sale and delivery, written notice stating that such fastener has not yet been inspected, tested, and certified as required by this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inspection and testing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The manufacturer of a lot of fasteners shall cause to be inspected and tested a representative sample, as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, of the fasteners in such lot to determine whether the lot conforms to the standards and specifications to which the manufacturer represents it has been manufactured. Such inspection and testing shall be performed by a laboratory accredited in accordance with the procedures and conditions specified by the Secretary under section 5405 of this title. The standards and specifications to which the manufacturer represents such lot has been manufactured shall be disclosed by the manufacturer to the laboratory at the time the lot is submitted for inspection and testing under this paragraph. The manufacturer of a lot may perform the inspection and testing required by this paragraph in a laboratory which it owns or with which it is otherwise affiliated, if such laboratory is accredited in accordance with the procedures and conditions specified by the Secretary under section 5405 of this title; unless the Secretary finds that, as to a specific type of fastener and as to a specific type of inspection or testing, a ban on manufacturer ownership or affiliation with the accredited laboratory would increase the protection of health and safety of the public or industrial workers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The size, selection, and integrity of the sample to be inspected and tested under paragraph (1) shall be governed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by the standards and specifications to which the manufacturer represents the fasteners in the sample have been manufactured; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such standards and specifications do not provide for the size, selection, or integrity of the sample, by sampling procedures prescribed by the Secretary, who shall to the extent practicable use consensus testing standards and related materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a purchaser from requiring the inspection and testing of a greater number of fasteners from a lot than is specified in the applicable standards and specifications or in the applicable sampling procedures prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Laboratory report of testing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a laboratory performing the inspection and testing under subsection (b)(1) of this section determines, as to the characteristics selected under the sampling procedures prescribed by the Secretary and based on the sample examined, that a lot conforms to the standards and specifications to which the manufacturer represents it has been manufactured, the laboratory shall provide to the manufacturer a written inspection and testing report with respect to such lot. The report, which shall be in a form prescribed by the Secretary by regulation, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) state the manufacturer's name, the part description, and the lot number and note the grade identification mark and insignia found on the fastener;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1384 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reference the standards and specifications disclosed by the manufacturer with respect to such lot under subsection (b)(1) of this section or, where applicable, certified by the manufacturer under section 5406(c)(1) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) list the markings and characteristics selected under the Secretary's procedures for testing, such as the chemical, dimensional, physical, mechanical, and any other significant characteristics required by the standards and specifications described in paragraph (2) and specify the results of the inspection and testing under subsection (b)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) state whether, based on the samples provided as representative of the lot, such lot has been found after such inspection and testing to conform to such standards and specifications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) bear the original signature of a laboratory employee or officer determined by the Secretary to be responsible for the accuracy of the report and of the inspection and testing to which it relates.</p>
