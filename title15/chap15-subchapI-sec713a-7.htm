In order to carry out the provisions of this section, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized, upon terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, to procure, convey, transport, handle, store, maintain, or rotate such surplus agricultural commodities, and such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials, as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.</p>

Such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials shall be stored on military or naval reservations or in other locations approved by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy. The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to transfer such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture shall approve, to any other governmental agency.
