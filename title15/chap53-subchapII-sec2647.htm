<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under subsection (a) of this section against a local educational agency, the Administrator shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the significance of the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the culpability of the violator, including any history of previous violations under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the ability of the violator to pay the penalty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the ability of the violator to continue to provide educational services to the community.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any action ordered by a court in fashioning relief under section 2619 of this title shall be consistent with regulations promulgated under section 2643 of this title (or with the requirements of section 2644 of this title if there are no regulations).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within 90 days after filing of a petition described in paragraph (1), the Administrator shall either grant or deny the petition. If the Administrator grants such petition, the Administrator shall promptly commence an appropriate proceeding in accordance with this subchapter. If the Administrator denies such petition, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the Administrator's reasons for such denial. The granting or denial of a petition under this subsection shall not affect any deadline or other requirement of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Citizen civil actions with respect to EPA regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person may commence a civil action without prior notice against the Administrator to compel the Administrator to meet the deadlines in section 2643 of this title for issuing advanced notices of proposed rulemaking, proposing regulations, and promulgating regulations. Any such action shall be brought in the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any action brought under paragraph (1) in which the court finds the Administrator to be in violation of any deadline in section 2643 of this title, the court shall set forth a schedule for promulgating the regulations required by section 2643 of this title and shall order the Administrator to comply with such schedule. The court may extend any deadline (which has not already occurred) in section 2644(b), (c), or (d) of this title for a period of not more than 6 months, if the court-ordered schedule will result in final promulgation of the pertinent regulations within the extended period. Such deadline extensions may not be granted by the court beginning 720 days after October 22, 1986.</p>
