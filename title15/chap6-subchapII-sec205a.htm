<h3 class="section-head">&sect;205a. Congressional statement of findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States was an original signatory party to the 1875 Treaty of the Meter (20 Stat. 709), which established the General Conference of Weights and Measures, the International Committee of Weights and Measures and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Although the use of metric measurement standards in the United States has been authorized by law since 1866 (Act of July 28, 1866; 14 Stat. 339), this Nation today is the only industrially developed nation which has not established a national policy of committing itself and taking steps to facilitate conversion to the metric system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) World trade is increasingly geared towards the metric system of measurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Industry in the United States is often at a competitive disadvantage when dealing in international markets because of its nonstandard measurement system, and is sometimes excluded when it is unable to deliver goods which are measured in metric terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The inherent simplicity of the metric system of measurement and standardization of weights and measures has led to major cost savings in certain industries which have converted to that system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Federal Government has a responsibility to develop procedures and techniques to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The metric system of measurement can provide substantial advantages to the Federal Government in its own operations.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Statement of Findings; Metric Conversion in Federal Construction Projects</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 104&ndash;289, &sect;2, Oct. 11, 1996, 110 Stat. 3411, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 [15 U.S.C. 205a et seq.] was enacted in order to set forth the policy of the United States to convert to the metric system. Section 3 of that Act [15 U.S.C. 205b] requires that each Federal agency use the metric system of measurements in its procurement, grants, and other business-related activities, unless that use is likely to cause significant cost or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In accordance with that Act and Executive Order 12770, of July 25, 1991 [set out below], Federal agencies increasingly construct new Federal buildings in round metric dimensions. As a result, companies that wish to bid on Federal construction projects increasingly are asked to supply materials or products in round metric dimensions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) While the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 currently provides an exemption to metric usage when impractical or when such usage will cause economic inefficiencies, amendments are warranted to ensure that the use of specific metric components in metric construction projects do not increase the cost of Federal buildings to the taxpayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12770, July 25, 1991, 56 F.R. 35801, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, Public Law 94&ndash;168 (15 U.S.C. 205a <em>et seq</em>.) (&ldquo;the Metric Conversion Act&rdquo;), as amended by section 5164 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Public Law 100&ndash;418 (&ldquo;the Trade and Competitiveness Act&rdquo;), and in order to implement the congressional designation of the metric system of measurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:485 --><p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Coordination by the Department of Commerce</em>. (a) The Secretary of Commerce (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) is designated to direct and coordinate efforts by Federal departments and agencies to implement Government metric usage in accordance with section 3 of the Metric Conversion Act (15 U.S.C. 205b), as amended by section 5164(b) of the Trade and Competitiveness Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In furtherance of his duties under this order, the Secretary is authorized:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) to charter an Interagency Council on Metric Policy (&ldquo;ICMP&rdquo;), which will assist the Secretary in coordinating Federal Government-wide implementation of this order. Conflicts and questions regarding implementation of this order shall be resolved by the ICMP. The Secretary may establish such subcommittees and subchairs within this Council as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.[;]</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) to form such advisory committees representing other interests, including State and local governments and the business community, as may be necessary to achieve the maximum beneficial effects of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) to issue guidelines, to promulgate rules and regulations, and to take such actions as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. Regulations promulgated by the Secretary shall function as policy guidelines for other agencies and departments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary shall report to the President annually regarding the progress made in implementing this order. The report shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) an assessment of progress made by individual Federal agencies towards implementing the purposes underlying this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) an assessment of the effect that this order has had on achieving the national goal of establishing the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) on October 1, 1992, any recommendations which the Secretary may have for additional measures, including proposed legislation, needed to achieve the full economic benefits of metric usage.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Department and Agency Responsibilities</em>. All executive branch departments and agencies of the United States Government are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order. Consistent with this mission, the head of each executive department and agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) use, to the extent economically feasible by September 30, 1992, or by such other date or dates established by the department or agency in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the metric system of measurement in Federal Government procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Other business-related activities include all use of measurement units in agency programs and functions related to trade, industry, and commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Metric usage shall not be required to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Heads of departments and agencies shall establish an effective process for a policy-level and program-level review of proposed exceptions to metric usage. Appropriate information about exceptions granted shall be included in the agency annual report along with recommendations for actions to enable future metric usage.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) seek out ways to increase understanding of the metric system of measurement through educational information and guidance and in Government publications. The transition to use of metric units in Government publications should be made as publications are revised on normal schedules or new publications are developed, or as metric publications are required in support of metric usage pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) seek the appropriate aid, assistance, and cooperation of other affected parties, including other Federal, State, and local agencies and the private sector, in implementing this order. Appropriate use shall be made of governmental, trade, professional, and private sector metric coordinating groups to secure the maximum benefits of this order through proper communication among affected sectors.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) formulate metric transition plans for the department or agency which shall incorporate the requirements of the Metric Conversion Act and this order, and which shall be approved by the department or agency head and be in effect by November 30, 1991. Copies of approved plans shall be forwarded to the Secretary of Commerce. Such metric transition plans shall specify, among other things:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the total scope of the metric transition task for that department or agency, including firm dates for all metric accomplishment milestones for the current and subsequent fiscal year;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) plans of the department or agency for specific initiatives to enhance cooperation with industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system, and with all affected parties in undertaking the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and</p>
