<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an unacceptable number of consumer products which present unreasonable risks of injury are distributed in commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) complexities of consumer products and the diverse nature and abilities of consumers using them frequently result in an inability of users to anticipate risks and to safeguard themselves adequately;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the public should be protected against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) control by State and local governments of unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products is inadequate and may be burdensome to manufacturers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) existing Federal authority to protect consumers from exposure to consumer products presenting unreasonable risks of injury is inadequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) regulation of consumer products the distribution or use of which affects interstate or foreign commerce is necessary to carry out this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and to minimize conflicting State and local regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of product-related deaths, illnesses, and injuries.</p>
