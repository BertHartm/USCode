<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The requirement described in subsection (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to a place of public accommodation affecting commerce with an automatic sprinkler system installed before October 25, 1992, if the automatic sprinkler system is installed in compliance with an applicable standard (adopted by the governmental authority having jurisdiction, and in effect, at the time of installation) that required the placement of a sprinkler head in the sleeping area of each guest room.</p>
