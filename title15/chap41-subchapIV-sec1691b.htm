These regulations may contain but are not limited to such classifications, differentiation, or other provision, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Bureau are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate or substantiate compliance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exempt transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such regulations may exempt from the provisions of this subchapter any class of transactions that are not primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or business or commercial loans made available by a financial institution, except that a particular type within a class of such transactions may be exempted if the Bureau determines, after making an express finding that the application of this subchapter or of any provision of this subchapter of such transaction would not contribute substantially to effecting the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An exemption granted pursuant to subsection (b) shall be for no longer than five years and shall be extended only if the Bureau makes a subsequent determination, in the manner described by such paragraph,<sup><a href="#1691b_1_target" name="1691b_1">1</a></sup> that such exemption remains appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Maintenance of records</h4>

In no event shall such records or data be maintained for a period of less than one year.

These regulations may contain but are not limited to such classifications, differentiation, or other provision, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate or substantiate compliance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Deference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any power granted to any Federal agency under this subchapter, the deference that a court affords to a Federal agency with respect to a determination made by such agency relating to the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this subchapter that is subject to the jurisdiction of such agency shall be applied as if that agency were the only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer the provisions of this subchapter&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1691b_4_target" name="1691b_4">4</a></sup></p>
