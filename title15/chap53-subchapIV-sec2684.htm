Any such State may also certify to the Administrator at the time of submitting such program that the State program meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section. Upon submission of such certification, the State program shall be deemed to be authorized under this section, and shall apply in such State in lieu of the corresponding Federal program under section 2682 or 2686 of this title, or both, as the case may be, until such time as the Ad<!-- PDFPage:1499 -->ministrator disapproves the program or withdraws the authorization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval or disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days following submission of an application under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall approve or disapprove the application.

<p class="statutory-body">If a State is not administering and enforcing a program authorized under this section in compliance with standards, regulations, and other requirements of this subchapter, the Administrator shall so notify the State and, if corrective action is not completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180 days, the Administrator shall withdraw authorization of such program and establish a Federal program pursuant to this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Model State program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 18 months after October 28, 1992, the Administrator shall promulgate a model State program which may be adopted by any State which seeks to administer and enforce a State program under this subchapter.
