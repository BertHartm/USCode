<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the extent that the servicer owes a duty to investors or other parties to maximize the net present value of such mortgages, the <!-- PDFPage:1314 -->duty shall be construed to apply to all such investors and parties, and not to any individual party or group of parties; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the servicer shall be deemed to have satisfied the duty set forth in paragraph (1) if, before December 31, 2012, the servicer implements a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Default on the payment of such mortgage has occurred, is imminent, or is reasonably foreseeable, as such terms are defined by guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The mortgagor occupies the property securing the mortgage as his or her principal residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The servicer reasonably determined, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee, that the application of such qualified loss mitigation plan to a mortgage or class of mortgages will likely provide an anticipated recovery on the outstanding principal mortgage debt that will exceed the anticipated recovery through foreclosures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) No liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A servicer that is deemed to be acting in the best interests of all investors or other parties under this section shall not be liable to any party who is owed a duty under subsection (a)(1), and shall not be subject to any injunction, stay, or other equitable relief to such party, based solely upon the implementation by the servicer of a qualified loss mitigation plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standard industry practice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The qualified loss mitigation plan guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.] shall constitute standard industry practice for purposes of all Federal and State laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Scope of safe harbor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person, including a trustee, issuer, and loan originator, shall not be liable for monetary damages or be subject to an injunction, stay, or other equitable relief, based solely upon the cooperation of such person with a servicer when such cooperation is necessary for the servicer to implement a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each servicer that engages in qualified loss mitigation plans under this section shall regularly report to the Secretary of the Treasury the extent, scope, and results of the servicer's modification activities.
