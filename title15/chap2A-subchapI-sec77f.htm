Fees collected during any fiscal year pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited and credited as offsetting collections in accordance with appropriations Acts.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Lapse of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If on the first day of a fiscal year a regular appropriation to the Commission has not been enacted, the Commission shall continue to collect fees (as offsetting collections) under this paragraph at the rate in effect during the preceding fiscal year, until such a regular appropriation is enacted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Pro rata application of rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates required by this subsection shall be applied pro rata to amounts and balances equal to less than $1,000,000.</p>
