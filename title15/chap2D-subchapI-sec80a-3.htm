<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 per centum of the value of such issuer's total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this section, &ldquo;investment securities&rdquo; includes all securities except (A) Government securities, (B) securities issued by employees&rsquo; securities companies, and (C) securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries of the owner which (i) are not investment companies, and (ii) are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company in paragraph (1) or (7) of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemption from provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(C) of subsection (a) of this section, none of the following persons is an investment company within the meaning of this subchapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Any issuer primarily engaged, directly or through a wholly-owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, in a business or businesses other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any issuer which the Commission, upon application by such issuer, finds and by order declares to be primarily engaged in a business or businesses other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities either directly or (A) through majority-owned subsidiaries or (B) through controlled companies conducting similar types of businesses. The filing of an application under this paragraph in good faith by an issuer other than a registered investment company shall exempt the applicant for a period of sixty days from all provisions of this subchapter applicable to investment companies as such. For cause shown, the Commission by order may extend such period of exemption for an additional period or periods.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any issuer all the outstanding securities of which (other than short-term paper and directors&rsquo; qualifying shares) are directly or indirectly owned by a company excepted from the definition of investment company by paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Further exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, none of the following persons is an investment company within the meaning of this subchapter:</p>

For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Beneficial ownership by a company shall be deemed to be beneficial ownership by one person, except that, if the company owns 10 per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer, and is or, but for the exception provided for in this paragraph or paragraph (7), would be an investment company, the beneficial ownership shall be deemed to be that of the holders of such company's outstanding securities (other than short-term paper).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Beneficial ownership by any person who acquires securities or interests in securities of an issuer described in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to be beneficial ownership by the person from whom such transfer was made, pursuant to such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this subchapter, where the transfer was caused by legal separation, divorce, death, or other involuntary event.</p>

Securities that are owned by persons who received the securities from a qualified purchaser as a gift or bequest, or in a case in which the transfer was caused by legal separation, divorce, death, or other involuntary event, shall be deemed to be owned by a qualified purchaser, subject to such rules, regulations, and orders as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), an issuer is within the exception provided by this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in addition to qualified purchasers, outstanding securities of that issuer are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons who are not qualified purchasers, if&mdash;</p>
