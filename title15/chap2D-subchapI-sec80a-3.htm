<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">As used in this section, &ldquo;investment securities&rdquo; includes all securities except (A) Government securities, (B) securities issued by employees&rsquo; securities companies, and (C) securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries of the owner which are not investment companies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemption from provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section, none of the following persons is an investment company within the meaning of this subchapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Any issuer primarily engaged, directly or through a wholly-owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, in a business or businesses other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any issuer which the Commission, upon application by such issuer, finds and by order declares to be primarily engaged in a business or businesses other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities either directly or (A) through majority-owned subsidiaries or (B) through controlled companies conducting similar types of businesses. The filing of an application under this paragraph in good faith by an issuer other than a registered investment company shall exempt the applicant for a period of sixty days from all provisions of this subchapter applicable to investment companies as such. For cause shown, the Commission by order may extend such period of exemption for an additional period or periods. Whenever the Com<!-- PDFPage:367 -->mission, upon its own motion or upon application, finds that the circumstances which gave rise to the issuance of an order granting an application under this paragraph no longer exist, the Commission shall by order revoke such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any issuer all the outstanding securities of which (other than short-term paper and directors&rsquo; qualifying shares) are directly or indirectly owned by a company excepted from the definition of investment company by paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Beneficial ownership by any person who acquires securities or interests in securities of an issuer described in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to be beneficial ownership by the person from whom such transfer was made, pursuant to such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this subchapter, where the transfer was caused by legal separation, divorce, death, or other involuntary event.</p>
