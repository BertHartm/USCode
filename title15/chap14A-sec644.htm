<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To effectuate the purposes of this chapter, small-business concerns within the meaning of this chapter shall receive any award or contract or any part thereof, and be awarded any contract for the sale of Government property, as to which it is determined by the Administration and the contracting procurement or disposal agency (1) to be in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full productive capacity, (2) to be in the interest of war or national defense programs, (3) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property and services for the Government in each industry category are placed with small-business concerns, or (4) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small-business concerns; but nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Government or any agency thereof. These determinations may be made for individual awards or contracts or for classes of awards or contracts. If a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business, and if the proposed procurement is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects, the Procurement Activity shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the Procurement Activity's Small Business Procurement Center Representative at least 30 days prior to the solicitation's issuance along with a statement explaining (1) why the proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement, (2) why delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government, (3) why the proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely, or (4) why construction cannot be procured as separate discrete projects. The thirty-day notification process shall occur concurrently with other processing steps required prior to issuance of the solicitation. Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed procurement and accompanying statement, if the Procurement Center Representative believes that the procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely, the Representative shall recommend to the Procurement Activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contracting opportunities. Whenever the Administration and the contracting procurement agency fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. For purposes of clause (3) of the first sentence of this subsection, an industry category is a discrete group of similar goods and services. Such groups shall be determined by the Administration in accordance with the four-digit standard industrial classification codes contained in the Standard Industrial Classification <!-- PDFPage:671 -->Manual published by the Office of Management and Budget, except that the Administration shall limit such an industry category to a greater extent than provided under such classification codes if the Administration receives evidence indicating that further segmentation for purposes of this paragraph is warranted due to special capital equipment needs or special labor or geographic requirements or to recognize a new industry. A market for goods or services may not be segmented under the preceding sentence due to geographic requirements unless the Government typically designates the area where work for contracts for such goods or services is to be performed and Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or services and, due to the fixed location of facilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it is unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outside of the general areas where such concerns are located. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under section 694b of this title, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Programs for blind and handicapped individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As used in this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under section 46 of title 41.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;public or private organization for the handicapped&rdquo; has the same meaning given such term in section 632(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;handicapped individual&rdquo; has the same meaning given such term in section 632(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to section 47 of title 41.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e), (f) Repealed. Pub. L. 103&ndash;355, title VII, &sect;7101(a), Oct. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 3367</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Goals for participation of small business concerns in procurement contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President shall annually establish Government-wide goals for procurement contracts <!-- PDFPage:672 -->awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns shall be established at not less than 20 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. Notwithstanding the Government-wide goal, each agency shall have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency. The Administration and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Government-wide prime contract goal established by the President pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of each Federal agency shall, after consultation with the Administration, establish goals for the participation by small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly established by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under such contracts. Whenever the Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be submitted to the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy for final determination. For the purpose of establishing goals under this subsection, the head of each Federal agency shall make consistent efforts to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts of the agency, including participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The head of each Federal agency, in attempting to attain such participation, shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) contracts awarded as the result of unrestricted competition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contracts awarded after competition restricted to eligible small business concerns under this section and under the program established under section 637(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Reports to Administration; submittal of information to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall report to the Administration on the extent of participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Such reports shall contain appropriate justifications for failure to meet the goals established under subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administration shall annually compile and analyze the reports submitted by the individual agencies pursuant to paragraph (1) and shall submit them to the President. The Administration's submission to the President shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Government-wide goals for participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women and the performance in attaining such goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The goals in effect for each agency and the agency's performance in attaining such goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An analysis of any failure to achieve the Government-wide goals or any individual agency goals and the actions planned by such agency (and approved by the Administration) to achieve the goals in the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The number and dollar value of contracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) noncompetitive negotiation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) competition restricted to small business concerns, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) unrestricted competitions,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">for each agency and on a Government-wide basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The number and dollar value of prime contracts and subcontracts awarded to small business concerns owned and controlled by women.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The President shall include the information required by paragraph (2) in each annual re<!-- PDFPage:673 -->port to the Congress on the state of small business prepared pursuant to section 631b(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Small business set-asides</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter or any other provision of law precludes exclusive small business set-asides for procurements of architectural and engineering services, research, development, test and evaluation, and each Federal agency is authorized to develop such set-asides to further the interests of small business in those areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Small business reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contract for the purchase of goods and services that has an anticipated value greater than $2,500 but not greater than $100,000 shall be reserved exclusively for small business concerns unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small business concerns that are competitive with market prices and are competitive with regard to the quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), a contracting officer shall consider a responsive offer timely received from an eligible small business offeror.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed as precluding an award of a contract with a value not greater than $100,000 under the authority of subsection (a) of section 637 of this title, section 2323 of title 10, section 712 of the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 (Public Law 100&ndash;656; 15 U.S.C. 644 note), or section 7102 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.</p>

Any breakout procurement center representative assigned under this subsection shall be in addition to the representative referred to in subsection (k)(6) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to carrying out the responsibilities assigned by the Administration, a breakout procurement center representative is authorized to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) receive unsolicited engineering proposals and, when appropriate (i) conduct a value analysis of such proposal to determine whether such proposal, if adopted, will result in lower costs to the United States without substantially impeding legitimate acquisition objectives and forward to personnel of the appropriate activity recommendations with respect to such proposal, or (ii) forward such proposals without analysis to personnel of the activity responsible for reviewing such proposals and who shall furnish the breakout procurement center representative with information regarding the disposition of any such proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) review the systems that account for the acquisition and management of technical data within the procurement center to assure that such systems provide the maximum availability and access to data needed for the preparation of offers to sell to the United States those supplies to which such data pertain which potential offerors are entitled to receive.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A breakout procurement center representative is authorized to appeal the failure to act favorably on any recommendation made pursuant to paragraph (2). Such appeal shall be filed and processed in the same manner and subject to the same conditions and limitations as an appeal filed by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Administration shall assign and co-locate at least two small business technical advisers to each major procurement center in addition to such other advisers as may be authorized from time to time.

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Administration shall establish personnel positions for breakout procurement representatives and advisers assigned pursuant to this subsection, which are classified at a grade level of the General Schedule sufficient to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;major procurement center&rdquo; means a procurement center that, in the opinion of the Administrator, purchases substantial dollar amounts of other than commercial items and which has the potential to incur significant savings as the result of the placement of a breakout procurement center representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) At such times as the Administrator deems appropriate, the breakout procurement center representative shall conduct familiarization sessions for contracting officers and other appropriate personnel of the procurement center to which such representative is assigned.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) report to their immediate supervisors all instances of noncompliance with such requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) increase, insofar as possible, the number and dollar value of procurements that may be used for the programs established under this section, section 637(a) of this title, and section 2323 of title 10.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Determination of labor surplus areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the determination of labor surplus areas shall be made on the <!-- PDFPage:675 -->basis of the criteria in effect at the time of the determination, except that any minimum population criteria shall not exceed twenty-five thousand. Such determination, as modified by the preceding sentence, shall be made by the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Requirements for performance of contracts by employees of small business concerns</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a contract for procurement of supplies (other than procurement from a regular dealer in such supplies), the concern will perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies (not including the cost of materials).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may change the percentage under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) if the Administrator determines that such change is necessary to reflect conventional industry practices among business concerns that are below the numerical size standard for businesses in that industry category.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administration shall establish, through public rulemaking, requirements similar to those specified in paragraph (1) to be applicable to contracts for general and specialty construction and to contracts for any other industry category not otherwise subject to the requirements of such paragraph. The percentage applicable to any such requirement shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of the Program are to demonstrate whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the competitive capabilities of small business firms in certain industry categories will enable them to successfully compete on an unrestricted basis for Federal contracting opportunities,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the use of targeted goaling and management techniques by procuring agencies, in conjunction with the Small Business Administration, can expand small business participation in Federal contracting opportunities which have been historically low, despite adequate numbers of qualified small business contractors in the economy, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) expanded use of full and open competition, as specified by the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (10 U.S.C. 2302(3) and 41 U.S.C. 403(7)), adversely affects small business participation in certain industry categories, taking into consideration the numerical dominance of small firms, the size and scope of most contracting opportunities, and the competitive capabilities of small firms.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Program Term</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Program shall commence on January 1, 1989, and terminate on September 30, 1997.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) have significant amounts of small business productive capacity that have not been utilized by the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) In developing its small business participation expansion program, each participating agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) prepare, and furnish to the Administration, a detailed, time-phased strategy (with incremental numerical goals); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) encourage and promote joint ventures, teaming agreements and other similar arrangements, which permit small business concerns to effectively compete for contract solicitations for which an individual small business concern would lack the requisite capacity or capability needed to establish responsibility for the award of a contract.</p>
