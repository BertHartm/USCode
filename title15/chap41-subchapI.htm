<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Informed use of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against <!-- PDFPage:1092 -->inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms of personal property leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress also finds that there has been a recent trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that these leases have been offered without adequate cost disclosures. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of the terms of leases of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms available to him, limit balloon payments in consumer leasing, enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms where appropriate, and to assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The definitions and rules of construction set forth in this section are applicable for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The term &ldquo;Board&rdquo; refers to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The term &ldquo;organization&rdquo; means a corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means a natural person or an organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The term &ldquo;credit&rdquo; means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1094 --><p class="statutory-body">(f) The term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; refers only to a person who both (1) regularly extends, whether in connection with loans, sales of property or services, or otherwise, consumer credit which is payable by agreement in more than four installments or for which the payment of a finance charge is or may be required, and (2) is the person to whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness or, if there is no such evidence of indebtedness, by agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of an open-end credit plan involving a credit card, the card issuer and any person who honors the credit card and offers a discount which is a finance charge are creditors. For the purpose of the requirements imposed under part D of this subchapter and sections 1637(a)(5), 1637(a)(6), 1637(a)(7), 1637(b)(1), 1637(b)(2), 1637(b)(3), 1637(b)(8), and 1637(b)(10) of this title, the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; shall also include card issuers whether or not the amount due is payable by agreement in more than four installments or the payment of a finance charge is or may be required, and the Board shall, by regulation, apply these requirements to such card issuers, to the extent appropriate, even though the requirements are by their terms applicable only to creditors offering open-end credit plans. Any person who originates 2 or more mortgages referred to in subsection (aa) of this section in any 12-month period or any person who originates 1 or more such mortgages through a mortgage broker shall be considered to be a creditor for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The term &ldquo;credit sale&rdquo; refers to any sale in which the seller is a creditor. The term includes any contract in the form of a bailment or lease if the bailee or lessee contracts to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the aggregate value of the property and services involved and it is agreed that the bailee or lessee will become, or for no other or a nominal consideration has the option to become, the owner of the property upon full compliance with his obligations under the contract.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1604. Disclosure guidelines</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Promulgation, contents, etc., of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Except in the case of a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title, these regulations may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Model disclosure forms and clauses; publication, criteria, compliance, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall publish model disclosure forms and clauses for common transactions to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of this subchapter and to aid the borrower or lessee in understanding the transaction by utilizing readily understandable language to simplify the technical nature of the disclosures. In devising such forms, the Board shall consider the use by creditors or lessors of data processing or similar automated equipment. Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to require a creditor or lessor to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the Board under this section. A creditor or lessor shall be deemed to be in compliance with the <!-- PDFPage:1098 -->disclosure provisions of this subchapter with respect to other than numerical disclosures if the creditor or lessor (1) uses any appropriate model form or clause as published by the Board, or (2) uses any such model form or clause and changes it by (A) deleting any information which is not required by this subchapter, or (B) rearranging the format, if in making such deletion or rearranging the format, the creditor or lessor does not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures applicable for adoption of model forms and clauses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Model disclosure forms and clauses shall be adopted by the Board after notice duly given in the Federal Register and an opportunity for public comment in accordance with section 553 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective dates of regulations containing new disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any regulation of the Board, or any amendment or interpretation thereof, requiring any disclosure which differs from the disclosures previously required by this part, part D, or part E of this subchapter or by any regulation of the Board promulgated thereunder shall have an effective date of that October 1 which follows by at least six months the date of promulgation, except that the Board may at its discretion take interim action by regulation, amendment, or interpretation to lengthen the period of time permitted for creditors or lessors to adjust their forms to accommodate new requirements or shorten the length of time for creditors or lessors to make such adjustments when it makes a specific finding that such action is necessary to comply with the findings of a court or to prevent unfair or deceptive disclosure practices. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, any creditor or lessor may comply with any such newly promulgated disclosure requirements prior to the effective date of the requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1604_1_target" name="1604_1">1</a></sup> Exemption authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may exempt, by regulation, from all or part of this subchapter any class of transactions, other than transactions involving any mortgage described in section 1602(aa) of this title, for which, in the determination of the Board, coverage under all or part of this subchapter does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining which classes of transactions to exempt in whole or in part under paragraph (1), the Board shall consider the following factors and publish its rationale at the time a proposed exemption is published for comment:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The amount of the loan and whether the disclosures, right of rescission, and other provisions provide a benefit to the consumers who are parties to such transactions, as determined by the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The extent to which the requirements of this subchapter complicate, hinder, or make more expensive the credit process for the class of transactions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The status of the borrower, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any related financial arrangements of the borrower, as determined by the Board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the financial sophistication of the borrower relative to the type of transaction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the importance to the borrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage under this subchapter, as determined by the Board;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) whether the goal of consumer protection would be undermined by such an exemption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Waiver for certain borrowers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board, by regulation, may exempt from the requirements of this subchapter certain credit transactions if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the transaction involves a consumer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with an annual earned income of more than $200,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) having net assets in excess of $1,000,000 at the time of the transaction; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a waiver that is handwritten, signed, and dated by the consumer is first obtained from the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments by the Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board, at its discretion, may adjust the annual earned income and net asset requirements of paragraph (1) for inflation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1605. Determination of finance charge</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Finance charge&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the finance charge in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be determined as the sum of all charges, payable <!-- PDFPage:1099 -->directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit. The finance charge does not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. The finance charge shall not include fees and amounts imposed by third party closing agents (including settlement agents, attorneys, and escrow and title companies) if the creditor does not require the imposition of the charges or the services provided and does not retain the charges. Examples of charges which are included in the finance charge include any of the following types of charges which are applicable:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Life, accident, or health insurance premiums included in finance charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Charges or premiums for credit life, accident, or health insurance written in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be included in the finance charges unless</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the coverage of the debtor by the insurance is not a factor in the approval by the creditor of the extension of credit, and this fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the person applying for or obtaining the extension of credit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in order to obtain the insurance in connection with the extension of credit, the person to whom the credit is extended must give specific affirmative written indication of his desire to do so after written disclosure to him of the cost thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Property damage and liability insurance premiums included in finance charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Charges or premiums for insurance, written in connection with any consumer credit transaction, against loss of or damage to property or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of property, shall be included in the finance charge unless a clear and specific statement in writing is furnished by the creditor to the person to whom the credit is extended, setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the creditor, and stating that the person to whom the credit is extended may choose the person through which the insurance is to be obtained.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Items exempted from computation of finance charge in all credit transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any of the following items is itemized and disclosed in accordance with the regulations of the Board in connection with any transaction, then the creditor need not include that item in the computation of the finance charge with respect to that transaction:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Fees and charges prescribed by law which actually are or will be paid to public officials for determining the existence of or for perfecting or releasing or satisfying any security related to the credit transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The premium payable for any insurance in lieu of perfecting any security interest otherwise required by the creditor in connection with the transaction, if the premium does not exceed the fees and charges described in paragraph (1) which would otherwise be payable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any tax levied on security instruments or on documents evidencing indebtedness if the payment of such taxes is a precondition for recording the instrument securing the evidence of indebtedness.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Items exempted from computation of finance charge in extensions of credit secured by an interest in real property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following items, when charged in connection with any extension of credit secured by an interest in real property, shall not be included in the computation of the finance charge with respect to that transaction:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Fees or premiums for title examination, title insurance, or similar purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Fees for preparation of loan-related documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Escrows for future payments of taxes and insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Fees for notarizing deeds and other documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Appraisal fees, including fees related to any pest infestation or flood hazard inspections conducted prior to closing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Credit reports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Tolerances for accuracy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with credit transactions not under an open end credit plan that are secured by real property or a dwelling, the disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected by any finance charge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of this subchapter if the amount disclosed as the finance charge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than $100; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is greater than the amount required to be disclosed under this subchapter; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a transaction, other than a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title, which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of any extension of credit under an open end credit plan, as the quotient (expressed as a percentage) of the total finance charge for the period to which it relates divided by the amount upon which the finance charge for that period is based, multiplied by the number of such periods in a year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of rate of finance charges for balances within a specified range</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a creditor imposes the same finance charge for balances within a specified range, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on the median balance within the range, except that if the Board determines that a rate so computed would not be meaningful, or would be materially misleading, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on such other basis as the Board may be regulation require.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1101 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allowable tolerances for purposes of compliance with disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The disclosure of an annual percentage rate is accurate for the purpose of this subchapter if the rate disclosed is within a tolerance not greater than one-eighth of 1 per centum more or less than the actual rate or rounded to the nearest one-fourth of 1 per centum. The Board may allow a greater tolerance to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of rate tables or charts having allowable variance from determined rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may authorize the use of rate tables or charts which may provide for the disclosure of annual percentage rates which vary from the rate determined in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section by not more than such tolerances as the Board may allow. The Board may not allow a tolerance greater than 8 per centum of that rate except to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of tolerances in determining annual percentage rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of creditors determining the annual percentage rate in a manner other than as described in subsection (d) of this section, the Board may authorize other reasonable tolerances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The terms used in paragraph (1) that are not defined in this subchapter or otherwise defined in section 3(s) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(s)) shall have the meaning given to them in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Violations of this subchapter deemed violations of pre-existing statutory requirements; additional agency powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of the exercise by any agency referred to in subsection (a) of this section of its powers under any Act referred to in that subsection, a violation of any requirement imposed under this subchapter shall be deemed to be a violation of a requirement imposed under that Act. In addition to its powers under any provision of law specifically referred to in subsection (a) of this section, each of the agencies referred to in that subsection may exercise, for the purpose of enforcing compliance with any requirement imposed under this subchapter, any other authority conferred on it by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Federal Trade Commission as overall enforcing agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except to the extent that enforcement of the requirements imposed under this subchapter is <!-- PDFPage:1102 -->specifically committed to some other Government agency under subsection (a) of this section, the Federal Trade Commission shall enforce such requirements. For the purpose of the exercise by the Federal Trade Commission of its functions and powers under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.], a violation of any requirement imposed under this subchapter shall be deemed a violation of a requirement imposed under that Act. All of the functions and powers of the Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act are available to the Commission to enforce compliance by any person with the requirements imposed under this subchapter, irrespective of whether that person is engaged in commerce or meets any other jurisdictional tests in the Federal Trade Commission Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority of the Board to issue regulations under this subchapter does not impair the authority of any other agency designated in this section to make rules respecting its own procedures in enforcing compliance with requirements imposed under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjustment of finance charges; procedures applicable, coverage, criteria, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In carrying out its enforcement activities under this section, each agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section, in cases where an annual percentage rate or finance charge was inaccurately disclosed, shall notify the creditor of such disclosure error and is authorized in accordance with the provisions of this subsection to require the creditor to make an adjustment to the account of the person to whom credit was extended, to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower. For the purposes of this subsection, except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in determining whether a disclosure error has occurred and in calculating any adjustment, (A) each agency shall apply (i) with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance of one-quarter of 1 percent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to section 1606(c) of this title, and (ii) with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerance provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate; except that (B) with respect to transactions consummated after two years following March 31, 1980, each agency shall apply (i) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of ten years or less, with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance not to exceed one-quarter of 1 percent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to section 1606(c) of this title, but in no event a tolerance of less than the tolerances allowed under section 1606(c) of this title, (ii) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of more than ten years, with respect to the annual percentage rate, only such tolerances as are allowed under section 1606(c) of this title, and (iii) for all transactions, with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerances provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each agency shall require such an adjustment when it determines that such disclosure error resulted from (A) a clear and consistent pattern or practice of violations, (B) gross negligence, or (C) a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom the credit was extended. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, an agency need not require such an adjustment if it determines that such disclosure error&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) resulted from an error involving the disclosure of a fee or charge that would otherwise be excludable in computing the finance charge, including but not limited to violations involving the disclosures described in sections 1605(b), (c) and (d) of this title, in which event the agency may require such remedial action as it determines to be equitable, except that for transactions consummated after two years after March 31, 1980, such an adjustment shall be ordered for violations of section 1605(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) involved a disclosed amount which was 10 per centum or less of the amount that should have been disclosed and (i) in cases where the error involved a disclosed finance charge, the annual percentage rate was disclosed correctly, and (ii) in cases where the error involved a disclosed annual percentage rate, the finance charge was disclosed correctly; in which event the agency may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) involved a total failure to disclose either the annual percentage rate or the finance charge, in which event the agency may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) resulted from any other unique circumstance involving clearly technical and nonsubstantive disclosure violations that do not adversely affect information provided to the consumer and that have not misled or otherwise deceived the consumer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of other such disclosure errors, each agency may require such an adjustment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), no adjustment shall be ordered&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if it would have a significantly adverse impact upon the safety or soundness of the creditor, but in any such case, the agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) require a partial adjustment in an amount which does not have such an impact; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) require the full adjustment, but permit the creditor to make the required adjustment in partial payments over an extended period of time which the agency considers to be reasonable, if (in the case of an agency referred to in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a) of this section), the agency determines that a partial adjustment or making partial payments over an extended period is <!-- PDFPage:1103 -->necessary to avoid causing the creditor to become undercapitalized pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1831<em>o</em>];</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1607_2_target" name="1607_2">2</a></sup> amount of the adjustment would be less than $1, except that if more than one year has elapsed since the date of the violation, the agency may require that such amount be paid into the Treasury of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in the case of an open-end credit plan, more than two years after the violation, or in the case of any other extension of credit, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to creditors that are subject to examination by the agencies referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, except in connection with violations arising from practices identified in the current examination and only in connection with transactions that are consummated after the date of the immediately preceding examination, except that where practices giving rise to violations identified in earlier examinations have not been corrected, adjustments for those violations shall be required in connection with transactions consummated after the date of examination in which such practices were first identified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to creditors that are not subject to examination by such agencies, except in connection with transactions that are consummated after May 10, 1978; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in no event after the later of (I) the expiration of the life of the credit extension, or (II) two years after the agreement to extend credit was consummated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an adjustment under this subsection may be required by an agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section only by an order issued in accordance with cease and desist procedures provided by the provision of law referred to in such subsections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In case of an agency which is not authorized to conduct cease and desist proceedings, such an order may be issued after an agency hearing on the record conducted at least thirty but not more than sixty days after notice of the alleged violation is served on the creditor. Such a hearing shall be deemed to be a hearing which is subject to the provisions of section 8(h) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1818(h)] and shall be subject to judicial review as provided therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection and notwithstanding any provision of law referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section, no agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section may require a creditor to make dollar adjustments for errors in any requirements under this subchapter, except with regard to the requirements of section 1666d of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A creditor shall not be subject to an order to make an adjustment, if within sixty days after discovering a disclosure error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or through the creditor's own procedures, the creditor notifies the person concerned of the error and adjusts the account so as to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Notwithstanding the second sentence of subsection (e)(1), subsection (e)(3)(C)(i), and subsection (e)(3)(C)(ii) of this section, each agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) of this section shall require an adjustment for an annual percentage rate disclosure error that exceeds a tolerance of one quarter of one percent less than the actual rate, determined without regard to section 1606(c) of this title, with respect to any transaction consummated between January 1, 1977, and March 31, 1980.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, this part and parts B and C of this subchapter, do not annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. Upon its own motion or upon the request of any creditor, State or other interested party which is submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Board, the Board shall determine whether any such inconsistency exists. If the Board determines that a State-required disclosure is inconsistent, creditors lo<!-- PDFPage:1105 -->cated in that State may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or form, and shall incur no liability under the law of that State for failure to use such term or form, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon its own motion or upon the request of any creditor, State, or other interested party which is submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Board, the Board shall determine whether any disclosure required under the law of any State is substantially the same in meaning as a disclosure required under this subchapter. If the Board determines that a State-required disclosure is substantially the same in meaning as a disclosure required by this subchapter, then creditors located in that State may make such disclosure in compliance with such State law in lieu of the disclosure required by this subchapter, except that the annual percentage rate and finance charge shall be disclosed as required by section 1632 of this title, and such State-required disclosure may not be made in lieu of the disclosures applicable to certain mortgages under section 1639 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 1639 of this title, this subchapter does not otherwise annul, alter or affect in any manner the meaning, scope or applicability of the laws of any State, including, but not limited to, laws relating to the types, amounts or rates of charges, or any element or elements of charges, permissible under such laws in connection with the extension or use of credit, nor does this subchapter extend the applicability of those laws to any class of persons or transactions to which they would not otherwise apply. The provisions of section 1639 of this title do not annul, alter, or affect the applicability of the laws of any State or exempt any person subject to the provisions of section 1639 of this title from complying with the laws of any State, with respect to the requirements for mortgages referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title, except to the extent that those State laws are inconsistent with any provisions of section 1639 of this title, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disclosure as evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action or proceeding in any court involving a consumer credit sale, the disclosure of the annual percentage rate as required under this subchapter in connection with that sale may not be received as evidence that the sale was a loan or any type of transaction other than a credit sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contract or other obligations under State or Federal law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as specified in sections 1635, 1640, and 1666e of this title, this subchapter and the regulations issued thereunder do not affect the validity or enforceability of any contract or obligation under State or Federal law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsection (c) of section 1632 of this title and subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of section 1637 of this title shall supersede any provision of the law of any State relating to the disclosure of information in any credit or charge card application or solicitation which is subject to the requirements of section 1637(c) of this title or any renewal notice which is subject to the requirements of section 1637(d) of this title, except that any State may employ or establish State laws for the purpose of enforcing the requirements of such sections.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Duty of creditor or lessor respecting one or more than one obligor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a creditor or lessor shall disclose to the person who is obligated on a consumer lease or a consumer credit transaction the information required under this subchapter. In a transaction involving more than one obligor, a creditor or lessor, except in a transaction under section 1635 of this title, need not disclose to more than one of such obligors if the obligor given disclosure is a primary obligor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Creditor or lessor required to make disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a transaction involves one creditor as defined in section 1602(f) of this title, or one lessor as defined in section 1667(3) of this title, such creditor or lessor shall make the disclosures. If a transaction involves more than one creditor or <!-- PDFPage:1108 -->lessor, only one creditor or lessor shall by required to make the disclosures. The Board shall by regulation specify which creditor or lessor shall make the disclosures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Estimates as satisfying statutory requirements; basis of disclosure for per diem interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may provide by regulation that any portion of the information required to be disclosed by this subchapter may be given in the form of estimates where the provider of such information is not in a position to know exact information. In the case of any consumer credit transaction a portion of the interest on which is determined on a per diem basis and is to be collected upon the consummation of such transaction, any disclosure with respect to such portion of interest shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of this subchapter if the disclosure is based on information actually known to the creditor at the time that the disclosure documents are being prepared for the consummation of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tolerances for numerical disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall determine whether tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate are necessary to facilitate compliance with this subchapter, and if it determines that such tolerances are necessary to facilitate compliance, it shall by regulation permit disclosures within such tolerances. The Board shall exercise its authority to permit tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate so that such tolerances are narrow enough to prevent such tolerances from resulting in misleading disclosures or disclosures that circumvent the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disclosure of obligor's right to rescind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the case of any consumer credit transaction <!-- PDFPage:1110 -->(including opening or increasing the credit limit for an open end credit plan) in which a security interest, including any such interest arising by operation of law, is or will be retained or acquired in any property which is used as the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, the obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter, whichever is later, by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Board, of his intention to do so. The creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the Board, to any obligor in a transaction subject to this section the rights of the obligor under this section. The creditor shall also provide, in accordance with regulations of the Board, appropriate forms for the obligor to exercise his right to rescind any transaction subject to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Return of money or property following rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When an obligor exercises his right to rescind under subsection (a) of this section, he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission. Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the boligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it. Upon the performance of the creditor's obligations under this section, the obligor shall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the obligor shall tender its reasonable value. Tender shall be made at the location of the property or at the residence of the obligor, at the option of the obligor. If the creditor does not take possession of the property within 20 days after tender by the obligor, ownership of the property vests in the obligor without obligation on his part to pay for it. The procedures prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when otherwise ordered by a court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rebuttable presumption of delivery of required disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any rule of evidence, written acknowledgment of receipt of any disclosures required under this subchapter by a person to whom information, forms, and a statement is required to be given pursuant to this section does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Modification and waiver of rights</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Time limit for exercise of right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever occurs first, notwithstanding the fact that the information and forms required under this section or any other disclosures required under this part have not been delivered to the obligor, except that if (1) any agency empowered to enforce the provisions of this subchapter institutes a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section within three years after the date of consummation of the transaction, (2) such agency finds a violation of this section, and (3) the obligor's right to rescind is based in whole or in part on any matter involved in such proceeding, then the obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the earlier sale of the property, or upon the expiration of one year following the conclusion of the proceeding, or any judicial review or period for judicial review thereof, whichever is later.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a mortgage broker fee is not included in the finance charge in accordance with the laws and regulations in effect at the time the consumer credit transaction was consummated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the form of notice of rescission for the transaction is not the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Board or a comparable written notice, and otherwise complied with all the requirements of this section regarding notice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Before opening any account under an open end consumer credit plan, the creditor shall disclose to the person to whom credit is to be extended <!-- PDFPage:1112 -->each of the following items, to the extent applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The conditions under which a finance charge may be imposed, including the time period (if any) within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge, except that the creditor may, at his election and without disclosure, impose no such finance charge if payment is received after the termination of such time period. If no such time period is provided, the creditor shall disclose such fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The method of determining the balance upon which a finance charge will be imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The method of determining the amount of the finance charge, including any minimum or fixed amount imposed as a finance charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Where one or more periodic rates may be used to compute the finance charge, each such rate, the range of balances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding nominal annual percentage rate determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of periods in a year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Identification of other charges which may be imposed as part of the plan, and their method of computation, in accordance with regulations of the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In cases where the credit is or will be secured, a statement that a security interest has been or will be taken in (A) the property purchased as part of the credit transaction, or (B) property not purchased as part of the credit transaction identified by item or type.</p>

With respect to one billing cycle per calendar year, at intervals of not less than six months or more than eighteen months, the creditor shall transmit such statement to each obligor to whom the creditor is required to transmit a statement pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for such billing cycle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) In the case of any account under an open end consumer credit plan which provides for any extension of credit which is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, any information which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is required to be disclosed under section 1637a(a) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Board determines is not described in any other paragraph of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement required with each billing cycle</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The creditor of any account under an open end consumer credit plan shall transmit to the obligor, for each billing cycle at the end of which there is an outstanding balance in that account or with respect to which a finance charge is imposed, a statement setting forth each of the following items to the extent applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The outstanding balance in the account at the beginning of the statement period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount and date of each extension of credit during the period, and a brief identification, on or accompanying the statement of each extension of credit in a form prescribed by the Board sufficient to enable the obligor either to identify the transaction or to relate it to copies of sales vouchers or similar instruments previously furnished, except that a creditor's failure to disclose such information in accordance with this paragraph shall not be deemed a failure to comply with this part or this subchapter if (A) the creditor maintains procedures reasonably adapted to procure and provide such information, and (B) the creditor responds to and treats any inquiry for clarification or documentation as a billing error and an erroneously billed amount under section 1666 of this title. In lieu of complying with the requirements of the previous sentence, in the case of any transaction in which the creditor and seller are the same person, as defined by the Board, and such person's open end credit plan has fewer than 15,000 accounts, the creditor may elect to provide only the amount and date of each extension of credit during the period and the seller's name and location where the transaction took place if (A) a brief identification of the transaction has been previously furnished, and (B) the creditor responds to and treats any inquiry for clarification or documentation as a billing error and an erroneously billed amount under section 1666 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The total amount credited to the account during the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The amount of any finance charge added to the account during the period, itemized to show the amounts, if any, due to the application of percentage rates and the amount, if any, imposed as a minimum or fixed charge.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Where the total finance charge exceeds 50 cents for a monthly or longer billing cycle, or the pro rata part of 50 cents for a billing cycle shorter than monthly, the total finance charge expressed as an annual percentage rate (determined under section 1606(a)(2) of this title), except that if the finance charge is the sum of two or more products of a rate times a portion of the balance, the creditor may, in lieu of disclosing a single rate for the total charge, disclose each such rate expressed as an annual percentage rate, and the part of the balance to which it is applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The balance on which the finance charge was computed and a statement of how the balance was determined. If the balance is determined without first deducting all credits during the period, that fact and the amount of such payments shall also be disclosed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The outstanding balance in the account at the end of the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The date by which or the period (if any) within which, payment must be made to avoid additional finance charges, except that the creditor may, at his election and without disclosure, impose no such additional finance <!-- PDFPage:1113 -->charge if payment is received after such date or the termination of such period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) add any charges which are not part of the finance charge or of the principal amount of the loan and which are financed by the consumer, including the cost of any items excluded from the finance charge pursuant to section 1605 of this title; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In conjunction with the disclosure of the amount financed, a creditor shall provide a statement of the consumer's right to obtain, upon a written request, a written itemization of the amount financed.

For the purposes of this subparagraph, &ldquo;itemization of the amount financed&rdquo; means a disclosure of the following items, to the extent applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount that is or will be paid directly to the consumer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The sum of the amount financed and the finance charge, which shall be termed the &ldquo;total of payments&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The number, amount, and due dates or period of payments scheduled to repay the total of payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In a sale of property or services in which the seller is the creditor required to disclose pursuant to section 1631(b) of this title, the &ldquo;total sale price&rdquo;, using that term, which shall be the total of the cash price of the property or services, additional charges, and the finance charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Descriptive explanations of the terms &ldquo;amount financed&rdquo;, &ldquo;finance charge&rdquo;, &ldquo;annual percentage rate&rdquo;, &ldquo;total of payments&rdquo;, and &ldquo;total sale price&rdquo; as specified by the Board. The descriptive explanation of &ldquo;total sale price&rdquo; shall include reference to the amount of the downpayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Where the credit is secured, a statement that a security interest has been taken in (A) the property which is purchased as part of the <!-- PDFPage:1121 -->credit transaction, or (B) property not purchased as part of the credit transaction identified by item or type.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) A statement indicating whether or not the consumer is entitled to a rebate of any finance charge upon refinancing or prepayment in full pursuant to acceleration or otherwise, if the obligation involves a precomputed finance charge. A statement indicating whether or not a penalty will be imposed in those same circumstances if the obligation involves a finance charge computed from time to time by application of a rate to the unpaid principal balance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) A statement that the consumer should refer to the appropriate contract document for any information such document provides about nonpayment, default, the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt, and prepayment rebates and penalties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) In any residential mortgage transaction, a statement indicating whether a subsequent purchaser or assignee of the consumer may assume the debt obligation on its original terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) In the case of any variable interest rate residential mortgage transaction, in disclosures provided at application as prescribed by the Board for a variable rate transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, at the option of the creditor, a statement that the periodic payments may increase or decrease substantially, and the maximum interest rate and payment for a $10,000 loan originated at a recent interest rate, as determined by the Board, assuming the maximum periodic increases in rates and payments under the program, or a historical example illustrating the effects of interest rate changes implemented according to the loan program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Form and timing of disclosures; residential mortgage transaction requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the disclosures required under subsection (a) of this section shall be made before the credit is extended. Except for the disclosures required by subsection (a)(1) of this section, all disclosures required under subsection (a) of this section and any disclosure provided for in subsection (b), (c), or (d) of section 1605 of this title shall be conspicuously segregated from all other terms, data, or information provided in connection with a transaction, including any computations or itemization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a residential mortgage transaction, as defined in section 1602(w) of this title, which is also subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act [12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.], good faith estimates of the disclosures required under subsection (a) of this section shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Board under section 1631(c) of this title before the credit is extended, or shall be delivered or placed in the mail not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application, which ever is earlier. If the disclosure statement furnished within three days of the written application contains an annual percentage rate which is subsequently rendered inaccurate within the meaning of section 1606(c) of this title, the creditor shall furnish another statement at the time of settlement or consummation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Timing of disclosures on unsolicited mailed or telephone purchase orders or loan requests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a creditor receives a purchase order by mail or telephone without personal solicitation, and the cash price and the total sale price and the terms of financing, including the annual percentage rate, are set forth in the creditor's catalog or other printed material distributed to the public, then the disclosures required under subsection (a) of this section may be made at any time not later than the date the first payment is due.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a creditor receives a request for a loan by mail or telephone without personal solicitation and the terms of financing, including the annual percentage rate for representative amounts of credit, are set forth in the creditor's printed material distributed to the public, or in the contract of loan or other printed material delivered to the obligor, then the disclosures required under subsection (a) of this section may be made at any time not later than the date the first payment is due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Timing of disclosure in cases of an addition of a deferred payment price to an existing outstanding balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a consumer credit sale is one of a series of consumer credit sales transactions made pursuant to an agreement providing for the addition of the deferred payment price of that sale to an existing outstanding balance, and the person to whom the credit is extended has approved in writing both the annual percentage rate or rates and the method of computing the finance charge or charges, and the creditor retains no security interest in any property as to which he has received payments aggregating the amount of the sales price including any finance charges attributable thereto, then the disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section for the particular sale may be made at any time not later than the date the first payment for that sale is due. For the purposes of this subsection, in the case of items purchased on different dates, the first purchased shall be deemed first paid for, and in the case of items purchased on the same date, the lowest price shall be deemed first paid for.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) of this title may contain a prepayment penalty (including terms calculating a refund by a method that is not prohibited under section 1615(b) of this title for the transaction in question) if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Individual or class action for damages; amount of award; factors determining amount of award</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, any creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this part, including any requirement under section 1635 of this title, or part D or E of this subchapter with respect to any person is liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any actual damage sustained by such person as a result of the failure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A)(i) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, (ii) in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease under part E of this subchapter, 25 per centum of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease, except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or (iii) in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a class action, such amount as the court may allow, except that as to each member of the class no minimum recovery shall be applicable, and the total recovery under this subparagraph in any class action or series of class actions arising out of the same failure to comply by the same creditor shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any successful action to enforce the foregoing liability or in any action in which a person is determined to have a right of rescission under section 1635 of this title, the costs of the action, together with a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of a failure to comply with any requirement under section 1639 of this title, an amount equal to the sum of all finance charges and fees paid by the consumer, unless the creditor demonstrates that the failure to comply is not material.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining the amount of award in any class action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors, the amount of any actual damages awarded, the frequency and persistence of failures of compliance by the creditor, the resources of the creditor, the number of persons adversely affected, and the extent to which the creditor's failure of compliance was intentional. In connection with the disclosures referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of section 1637 of this title, a creditor shall have a liability determined under paragraph (2) only for failing to comply with the requirements of section 1635 of this title, section 1637(a) of this title, or of paragraph (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), or (10) of section 1637(b) of this title or for failing to comply with disclosure requirements under State law for any term or item which the Board has determined to be substantially the same in meaning under section 1610(a)(2) of this title as any of the terms or items referred to in section 1637(a) of this title or any of those paragraphs of section 1637(b) of this title. In connection with the disclosures referred to in subsection (c) or (d) of section 1637 of this title, a card issuer shall have a liability under this section only to a cardholder who pays a fee described in section 1637(c)(1)(A)(ii)(I) or section 1637(c)(4)(A)(i) of this title or who uses the credit card or charge card. In connection with the disclosures referred to in section 1638 of this title, a creditor shall have a liability determined under paragraph (2) only for failing to comply with the requirements of section 1635 of this title or of paragraph (2) (insofar as it requires a disclosure of the &ldquo;amount financed&rdquo;), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (9) of section 1638(a) of this title, or for failing to comply with disclosure requirements under State law for any term which the Board has determined to be substantially the same in meaning under section 1610(a)(2) of this title as any of the terms referred to in any of those paragraphs of section 1638(a) of this title. With respect to any failure to make disclosures required under this part or part D or E of this subchapter, liability shall be imposed only upon the creditor required to make disclosure, except as provided in section 1641 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Correction of errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor or assignee has no liability under this section or section 1607 of this title or section 1611 of this title for any failure to comply with any requirement imposed under this part or part E of this subchapter, if within sixty days after discovering an error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or notice issued under section 1607(e)(1) of this title or through the creditor's or assignee's own procedures, and prior to the institution of an action under this section or the receipt of written notice of the error from the obligor, the creditor or assignee notifies the person concerned of the error and makes whatever adjustments in the appropriate account are necessary to assure that the person will not be required to pay an amount in excess of the charge actually disclosed, or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unintentional violations; bona fide errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor or assignee may not be held liable in any action brought under this section or section 1635 of this title for a violation of this subchapter if the creditor or assignee shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error. Examples of a bona fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programing, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to a person's obligations under this subchapter is not a bona fide error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Liability in transaction or lease involving multiple obligors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When there are multiple obligors in a consumer credit transaction or consumer lease, there shall be no more than one recovery of damages under subsection (a)(2) of this section for a violation of this subchapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1125 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Jurisdiction of courts; limitations on actions; State attorney general enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any action under this section may be brought in any United States district court, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation. This subsection does not bar a person from asserting a violation of this subchapter in an action to collect the debt which was brought more than one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation as a matter of defense by recoupment or set-off in such action, except as otherwise provided by State law. An action to enforce a violation of section 1639 of this title may also be brought by the appropriate State attorney general in any appropriate United States district court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, not later than 3 years after the date on which the violation occurs. The State attorney general shall provide prior written notice of any such civil action to the Federal agency responsible for enforcement under section 1607 of this title and shall provide the agency with a copy of the complaint. If prior notice is not feasible, the State attorney general shall provide notice to such agency immediately upon instituting the action. The Federal agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) intervene in the action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon intervening&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) remove the action to the appropriate United States district court, if it was not originally brought there; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be heard on all matters arising in the action; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) file a petition for appeal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Good faith compliance with rule, regulation, or interpretation of Board or with interpretation or approval of duly authorized official or employee of Federal Reserve System</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section, section 1607(b) of this title, section 1607(c) of this title, section 1607(e) of this title, or section 1611 of this title imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Board or in conformity with any interpretation or approval by an official or employee of the Federal Reserve System duly authorized by the Board to issue such interpretations or approvals under such procedures as the Board may prescribe therefor, notwithstanding that after such act or omission has occurred, such rule, regulation, interpretation, or approval is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Recovery for multiple failures to disclose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The multiple failure to disclose to any person any information required under this part or part D or E of this subchapter to be disclosed in connection with a single account under an open end consumer credit plan, other single consumer credit sale, consumer loan, consumer lease, or other extension of consumer credit, shall entitle the person to a single recovery under this section but continued failure to disclose after a recovery has been granted shall give rise to rights to additional recoveries. This subsection does not bar any remedy permitted by section 1635 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Offset from amount owed to creditor or assignee; rights of defaulting consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person may not take any action to offset any amount for which a creditor or assignee is potentially liable to such person under subsection (a)(2) of this section against any amount owed by such person, unless the amount of the creditor's or assignee's liability under this subchapter has been determined by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action of which such person was a party. This subsection does not bar a consumer then in default on the obligation from asserting a violation of this subchapter as an original action, or as a defense or counterclaim to an action to collect amounts owed by the consumer brought by a person liable under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Class action moratorium</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period beginning on May 18, 1995, and ending on October 1, 1995, no court may enter any order certifying any class in any action under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is brought in connection with any credit transaction not under an open end credit plan which is secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling and constitutes a refinancing or consolidation of an existing extension of credit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is based on the alleged failure of a creditor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to include a charge actually incurred (in connection with the transaction) in the finance charge disclosed pursuant to section 1638 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to properly make any other disclosure required under section 1638 of this title as a result of the failure described in clause (i); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to provide proper notice of rescission rights under section 1635(a) of this title due to the selection by the creditor of the incorrect form from among the model forms prescribed by the Board or from among forms based on such model forms.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions for certain alleged violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to any action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) described in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(B), if the amount disclosed as the finance charge results in an annual percentage rate that exceeds the tolerance provided in section 1606(c) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) described in paragraph (1)(B)(iii), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no notice relating to rescission rights under section 1635(a) of this title was provided in any form; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) proper notice was not provided for any reason other than the reason described in such paragraph.</p>

The preceding sentence does not affect rights of a consumer under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section or any other provision of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, relief provided as a result of any action made permissible by paragraph (1) may not exceed&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement provided in connection with such transaction pursuant to this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the assignment to the assignee was voluntary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Violation apparent on the face of the disclosure described</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A servicer of a consumer obligation arising from a consumer credit transaction shall not be treated as the owner of the obligation for purposes of this section on the basis of an assignment of the obligation from the creditor or another assignee to the servicer solely for the administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the obligation. Upon written request by the obligor, the servicer shall provide the obligor, to the best knowledge of the servicer, with the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the obligation or the master servicer of the obligation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Servicer&rdquo; defined</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms changed after application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any term or condition described in section 1637a(a) of this title which is disclosed to a consumer in connection with an application to open an account under an open end consumer credit plan described in such section (other than a variable feature of the plan) changes before the account is opened, and if, as a result of such change, the consumer elects not to enter into the plan agreement, the creditor shall refund all fees paid by the consumer in connection with such application.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Additional requirements relating to refunds and imposition of nonrefundable fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sets forth the reasons for the obligor's belief (to the extent applicable) that the statement contains a billing error,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the creditor shall, unless the obligor has, after giving such written notice and before the expiration of the time limits herein specified, agreed that the statement was correct&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not later than two complete billing cycles of the creditor (in no event later than ninety days) after the receipt of the notice and prior to taking any action to collect the amount, or any part thereof, indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) either&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) send a written explanation or clarification to the obligor, after having conducted an investigation, setting forth to the extent applicable the reasons why the creditor believes the account of the obligor was correctly shown in the statement and, upon request of the obligor, provide copies of documentary evidence of the obligor's indebtedness. In the case of a billing error where the obligor alleges that the creditor's billing statement reflects goods not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of the transaction, a creditor may not construe such amount to be correctly shown unless he determines that such goods were actually delivered, mailed, or otherwise sent to the obligor and provides the obligor with a statement of such determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">After complying with the provisions of this subsection with respect to an alleged billing error, a creditor has no further responsibility under this section if the obligor continues to make substantially the same allegation with respect to such error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, a &ldquo;billing error&rdquo; consists of any of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A reflection on a statement of an extension of credit for which the obligor requests additional clarification including documentary evidence thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A reflection on a statement of goods or services not accepted by the obligor or his designee or not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of a transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The creditor's failure to reflect properly on a statement a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637(b) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Any other error described in regulations of the Board.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action by creditor to collect amount or any part thereof regarded by obligor to be a billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, &ldquo;action to collect the amount, or any part thereof, indicated by an obligor under paragraph (2)&rdquo; does not include the sending of statements of account, which may include finance charges on amounts in dispute, to the obligor following written notice from the obligor as specified under subsection (a) of this section, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any action by a creditor to collect any amount which has not been indicated by the obligor to contain a billing error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restricting or closing by creditor of account regarded by obligor to contain a billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to regulations of the Board, a creditor operating an open end consumer credit plan may not, prior to the sending of the written explanation or clarification required under paragraph (B)(ii), restrict or close an account with respect to which the obligor has indicated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section that he believes such account to contain a billing error solely because of the obligor's failure to pay the amount indicated to be in error. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to prohibit a creditor from applying against the credit limit on the obligor's account the amount indicated to be in error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of noncompliance with requirements by creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any creditor who fails to comply with the requirements of this section or section 1666a of <!-- PDFPage:1136 -->this title forfeits any right to collect from the obligor the amount indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, and any finance charges thereon, except that the amount required to be forfeited under this subsection may not exceed $50.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Estimated residual value of property as basis; presumptions; action by lessor for excess liability; mutually agreeable final adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the lessee's liability on expiration of a consumer lease is based on the estimated residual value of the property such estimated residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, where the lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor's estimated residual value is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on expiration of a consumer lease unless the lessor brings a successful action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor shall pay the lessee's reasonable attorney's fees. The presumptions stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of estimated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjustment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an agreement is reached after termination of the lease.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Penalties and charges for delinquency, default, or early termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Independent professional appraisal of residual value of property at termination of lease; finality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a lease has a residual value provision at the termination of the lease, the lessee may obtain at his expense, a professional appraisal of the leased property by an independent third party agreed to by both parties. Such appraisal shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 2605(a) of div. A of Pub. L. 104&ndash;208 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) to assure a simple, meaningful disclosure of leasing terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various leasing terms available to the consumer and avoid the uninformed use of leasing, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair leasing practices;</p>
