<h3 class="section-head">&sect;631. Declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Aid, counsel, assistance, etc., to small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of such competition is basic not only to the economic well-being but to the security of this Nation. Such security and well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of small business is encouraged and developed. It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance to compete in international markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Federal Government, through the Small Business Administration, acting in cooperation with the Department of Commerce and other relevant State and Federal agencies, should aid and assist small businesses, as defined under this chapter, to increase their ability to compete in international markets by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enhancing their ability to export;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) facilitating technology transfers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) enhancing their ability to compete effectively and efficiently against imports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) increasing the access of small businesses to long-term capital for the purchase of new plant and equipment used in the production of goods and services involved in international trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) disseminating information concerning State, Federal, and private programs and initiatives to enhance the ability of small businesses to compete in international markets; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress recognizes that the Department of Commerce is the principal Federal agency for trade development and export promotion and that the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration work together to advance joint interests. It is the purpose of this chapter to enhance, not alter, their respective roles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aid for agriculturally related industries; financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government, through the Small Business Administration, should aid and assist small business concerns which are engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries; and the financial assistance programs authorized by this chapter are also to be used to assist such concerns.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of assistance programs to establish, preserve, and strengthen small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The assistance programs authorized by sections 636(i) and 636(j) of this title are to be utilized to assist in the establishment, preservation, and strengthening of small business concerns and improve the managerial skills employed in such enterprises, with special attention to small business concerns (1) located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals; or (2) owned by low-income individuals; and to mobilize for these objectives private as well as public managerial skills and resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to the programs authorized by section 636(j) of this title, the Congress finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that ownership and control of productive capital is concentrated in the economy of the United States and certain groups, therefore, own and control little productive capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) that certain groups in the United States own and control little productive capital because they have limited opportunities for small business ownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) that the broadening of small business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital is essential to provide for the well-being of this Nation by promoting their increased participation in the free enterprise system of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) that such development of business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital will be greatly facilitated through the creation of a small business ownership development program, which shall provide services, including, but not limited to, financial, management, and technical assistance.<sup><a href="#631_1_target" name="631_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) that the power to let Federal contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title can be an effective procurement assistance tool for development of business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) that the procurement authority under section 637(a) of this title shall be used only as a tool for developing business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) It is therefore the purpose of the programs authorized by section 636(j) of this title to&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:598 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) foster business ownership and development by individuals in groups that own and control little productive capital; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) promote the competitive viability of such firms in the marketplace by creating a small business and capital ownership development program to provide such available financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assistance to victims of floods, etc., and those displaced as result of federally aided construction programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Further, it is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid and assist victims of floods and other catastrophes, and small-business concerns which are displaced as a result of federally aided construction programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings; purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) with&nbsp;<sup><a href="#631_2_target" name="631_2">2</a></sup> respect to the Administration's business development programs the Congress finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that many such persons are socially disadvantaged because of their identification as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects of discriminatory practices or similar invidious circumstances over which they have no control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that such groups include, but are not limited to, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Indian tribes, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and other minorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that it is in the national interest to expeditiously ameliorate the conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that such conditions can be improved by providing the maximum practicable opportunity for the development of small business concerns owned by members of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that such development can be materially advanced through the procurement by the United States of articles, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from such concerns; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) that such procurements also benefit the United States by encouraging the expansion of suppliers for such procurements, thereby encouraging competition among such suppliers and promoting economy in such procurements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is therefore the purpose of section 637(a) of this title to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals so that such concerns can compete on an equal basis in the American economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) promote the competitive viability of such concerns in the marketplace by providing such available contract, financial, technical, and mangement&nbsp;<sup><a href="#631_3_target" name="631_3">3</a></sup> assistance as may be necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) clarify and expand the program for the procurement by the United States of articles, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Assistance to disaster victims under disaster loan program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In administering the disaster loan program authorized by section 636 of this title, to the maximum extent possible, the Administration shall provide assistance and counseling to disaster victims in filing applications, providing information relevant to loan processing, and in loan closing and prompt disbursement of loan proceeds and shall give the disaster program a high priority in allocating funds for administrative expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Assistance to women owned business</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to the programs and activities authorized by this chapter, the Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) women owned business has become a major contributor to the American economy by providing goods and services, revenues, and jobs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) over the past two decades there have been substantial gains in the social and economic status of women as they have sought economic equality and independence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) despite such progress, women, as a group, are subjected to discrimination in entrepreneurial endeavors due to their gender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such discrimination takes many overt and subtle forms adversely impacting the ability to raise or secure capital, to acquire managerial talents, and to capture market opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) it is in the national interest to expeditiously remove discriminatory barriers to the creation and development of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the removal of such barriers is essential to provide a fair opportunity for full participation in the free enterprise system by women and to further increase the economic vitality of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) increased numbers of small business concerns owned and controlled by women will directly benefit the United States Government by expanding the potential number of suppliers of goods and services to the Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) programs and activities designed to assist small business concerns owned and controlled by women must be implemented in such a way as to remove such discriminatory barriers while not adversely affecting the rights of socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is, therefore, the purpose of those programs and activities conducted under the authority of this chapter that assist women entrepreneurs to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) vigorously promote the legitimate interests of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) remove, insofar as possible, the discriminatory barriers that are encountered by <!-- PDFPage:599 -->women in accessing capital and other factors of production; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) require that the Government engage in a systematic and sustained effort to identify, define and analyze those discriminatory barriers facing women and that such effort directly involve the participation of women business owners in the public/private sector partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Prohibition on use of funds for individuals not lawfully within United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">None of the funds made available pursuant to this chapter may be used to provide any direct benefit or assistance to any individual in the United States if the Administrator or the official to which the funds are made available receives notification that the individual is not lawfully within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Contract bundling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In complying with the statement of congressional policy expressed in subsection (a) of this section, relating to fostering the participation of small business concerns in the contracting opportunities of the Government, each Federal agency, to the maximum extent practicable, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) comply with congressional intent to foster the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) structure its contracting requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns, taking all reasonable steps to eliminate obstacles to their participation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contract requirements that precludes small business participation in procurements as prime contractors.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to enforce rigorously the letter and spirit of public laws that promote increased participation in Federal procurement by Small Businesses Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals (SDBs) as described in section 8 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as described in 34 C.F.R. 608.2, and Minority Institutions (MIs) as referred to in sections 1046(3) and 316(b)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1135d-5(3) and 1059c(b)(1), respectively), it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy Statement</em>. It is the policy of the United States Government that all department and agency heads and all Federal employees involved in the procurement of any and all goods and services shall assist SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs, as applicable, to develop viable, self-sustaining businesses capable of competing on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy. To that end, all Federal personnel shall commit to the letter and spirit of all laws promoting the participation of SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs in Federal procurement. The laws promote:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) the award of contracts to SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs through the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) [15 U.S.C. 637(a)] Program, the Department of Defense Small and Disadvantaged Business Program, other agency programs, and through other specific statutory authority or appropriate means;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) the establishment of particular goals for SDBs, HBCUs, or MIs on an agency-by-agency basis and the requirement that prime contractors and other recipients of Federal funds attain similar goals in their procurement; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) the establishment of other mechanisms that ensure that SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs have a fair opportunity to participate in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Attainment of Goals</em>. All departments and agencies are required by law to establish participation goals of not less than 5 percent (15 U.S.C. 644(g)) or a greater percentage where otherwise required by law, as further provided in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 91&ndash;1 of March 11, 1991. Although the Federal Government has made substantial strides toward meeting established SDB, HBCU, and MI participation goals, certain departments and agencies have from time to time failed to aggressively pursue such goals. Department and agency heads are henceforth directed to execute, implement, and otherwise aggressively strive to fulfill the statutorily-mandated procurement participation goals. In addition, all departments and agencies are encouraged to set reasonable participation goals that exceed statutory requirements, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Subcontracting Plans</em>. The Small Business Act, (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and other related laws require certain prime contractors to maximize the use of SDBs in subcontracting plans and strive to achieve stated goals through prime contractors&rsquo; subcontracting practices. Department and agency heads are directed to aggressively enforce these prime contractors&rsquo; obligations to maximize awards of subcontracts to eligible SDBs.</p>

<p class="note-body">(a) Section 15(k) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(k)) establishes in each Federal department and agency an OSDBU and requires that the Director of the OSDBU &ldquo;be responsible only to, and report directly to, the head of such agency or to the deputy of such head&rdquo; (15 U.S.C. 644(k)(3)). To the extent not prohibited by law, each department and agency shall ensure that the aforementioned direct reporting requirements are henceforth vigorously enforced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Because of the importance of the OSDBU function, each department and agency shall also, to the extent not prohibited by law, comply with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 79&ndash;1 of March 7, 1979, which provides implementation guidance on section 15k [15(k)] and the organizational placement and functions of the OSDBU.</p>

Department and agency anti-fraud enforcement, however, shall not diminish agency vigor in achieving the aforementioned participation goals, which exist to promote the development of legitimate SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Nothing herein is intended to change self-certification requirements.</p>

In addition, the Department of Labor (Labor) shall undertake a number of proactive steps to support public outreach activities aimed at workers, employers, the media, local officials, the community, and labor organizations and their members to improve awareness of the adjustment assistance available through Labor programs, including, but not limited to:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Seal; appointment and compensation of personnel; use of other services and facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration shall have power to adopt, alter, and use a seal, which shall be judicially noticed. The Administrator is authorized, subject to the civil service and classification laws, to select, employ, appoint, and fix the compensation of such officers, employees, attorneys, and agents as shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter; to define their authority and duties; and to pay the costs of qualification of certain of them as notaries public. The Administration, with the consent of any board, commission, independent establishment, or executive department of the Government, may avail itself on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis of the use of information, services, facilities (including any field service thereof), officers, and employees thereof, in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Powers of Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the performance of, and with respect to, the functions, powers, and duties vested in him by this chapter the Administrator may&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against third parties assigned to the Administrator in connection with loans made by him.

The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Administrator deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein acquired by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be exercised by the Administrator or by any officer or agent appointed by him without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Administrator from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer or agent he may appoint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) acquire, in any lawful manner, any property (real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible), whenever deemed necessary or appropriate to the conduct of the activities authorized in sections 636(a) and 636(b) of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) accept the services and facilities of Federal, State, and local agencies and groups, both public and private, and utilize such gratuitous services and facilities as may, from time to time, be necessary, to further the objectives of section 636(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) upon purchase by the Administration of any deferred participation entered into under section 636 of this title, continue to charge a rate of interest not to exceed that initially charged by the participating institution on the amount so purchased for the remaining term of the indebtedness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) make such investigations as he deems necessary to determine whether a recipient of or participant in any assistance under this chapter or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or re<!-- PDFPage:632 -->fusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a recipient or participant, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) impose, retain, and use only those fees which are specifically authorized by law or which are in effect on September 30, 1994, and in the amounts and at the rates in effect on such date, except that the Administrator may, subject to approval in appropriations Acts, impose, retain, and utilize, additional fees&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Safety deposit box rentals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31 shall not apply to prepayments of rentals made by the Administration on safety deposit boxes used by the Administration for the safeguarding of instruments held as security for loans or for the safeguarding of other documents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Undertaking or suspension of payment obligation; period; extension of maturity; repayment agreement; &ldquo;required payments&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the requirements and conditions contained in this subsection, upon application by a small business concern which is the recipient of a loan made under this chapter, the Administration may undertake the small business concern's obligation to make the required payments under such loan or may suspend such obligation if the loan was a direct loan made by the Administration. While such payments are being made by the Administration pursuant to the undertaking of such obligation or while such obligation is suspended, no such payment with respect to the loan may be required from the small business concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administration may undertake or suspend for a period of not to exceed 5 years any small business concern's obligation under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the sole discretion of the Administration, become or remain a viable small business entity; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) each loan, except each loan made under section 636(a)(14) of this title, shall have been fully disbursed to the borrower prior to any sale.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a loan is sold in the secondary market, the lender shall remain obligated under its guarantee agreement with the Administration, and shall continue to service the loan in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administration shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for assessing the increase of small business access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations. Beginning on March 31, 1997, the sale of the unguaranteed portion of any loan made under section 636(a) of this title shall not be permitted until a final regulation that applies uniformly to both depository institutions and other lenders is promulgated by the Administration setting forth the terms and conditions under which such sales can be permitted, including maintenance of appropriate reserve requirements and other safeguards to protect the safety and soundness of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (g) of this section shall be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made pursuant to section 636(a) of this title, the guaranteed portion of which may be included in such trust or pool, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party pursuant to section 636(a)(6)(C) of this title or subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Trust certificates; guarantee of timely payments of principal and interest; full faith and credit of United States; collection of fees; subrogation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administration is authorized to issue trust certificates representing ownership of all or a fractional part of the guaranteed portion of one or more loans which have been guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter, or under section 696 of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That such trust certificates shall be based on and backed by a trust or pool approved by the Administration and composed solely of the entire guaranteed portion of such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administration is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of the principal of and interest on trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent for purposes of this subsection. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans which compose the trust or pool. In the event that a loan in such trust or pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or in the event of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administration only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the trust certificate, it may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee of such trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Administration may collect a fee for any loan guarantee sold into the secondary market under subsection (f) of this section in an amount equal to not more than 50 percent of the portion of the sale price that exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the portion of the loan guaranteed by the Administration. Any such fee imposed by the Administration shall be collected by the Administration or <!-- PDFPage:634 -->by the agent which carries out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions required by subsection (h) of this section and shall be paid to the Administration and used solely to reduce the subsidy on loans guaranteed under section 636(a) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That such fee shall not be charged to the borrower whose loan is guaranteed: and, <em>Provided further</em>, That nothing herein shall preclude any agent of the Administration from collecting a fee approved by the Administration for the functions described in subsection (h)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#634_1_target" name="634_1">1</a></sup> of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administration is authorized to impose and collect, either directly or through a fiscal and transfer agent, a reasonable penalty on late payments of the fee authorized under subparagraph (A) in an amount not to exceed 5 percent of such fee per month plus interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Administration may contract with an agent to carry out, on behalf of the Administration, the assessment and collection of the annual fee established under section 636(a)(23) of this title. The agent may receive, as compensation for services, any interest earned on the fee while in the control of the agent before the time at which the agent is contractually required to remit the fee to the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In the event the Administration pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, it shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Administration of its ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the trust or pool against which the trust certificates are issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Central registration of loans and trust certificates; contracts with agent; disclosures by sellers of guaranteed portions of loans; regulation of brokers and dealers; electronic registration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the adoption of final rules and regulations, the Administration shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contract with an agent to carry out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions of this section and the issuance of trust certificates to facilitate pooling. Such agent shall provide a fidelity bond or insurance in such amounts as the Administration determines to be necessary to fully protect the interest of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) prior to any sale, require the seller to disclose to a purchaser of the guaranteed portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to the purchaser of a trust certificate issued pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this paragraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term &ldquo;seller&rdquo; does not include (A) an entity which made the loan or (B) any individual or entity which sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) have the authority to regulate brokers and dealers in guaranteed loans and trust certificates sold pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Capital Ownership Development Program administered by the Small Business Administration and the award of contracts pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 637(a)] remain a primary tool for improving opportunities for small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the Federal procurement process and bringing such concerns into the nation's economic mainstream;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) although some progress has resulted from the Program, it has generally failed to meet its objectives, which remain as valid now as when the Program was initiated;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) too few concerns that have exited the Program have been prepared to compete successfully in the open marketplace on competitive procurements, and many concerns have developed an unhealthy dependency on sole-source contracts by the time they are required to leave the Program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the application and certification process for admitting new participants to the Program is inordinately lengthy and burdensome;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Administration has often not efficiently and equitably administered and managed the Program in a manner that provided clear lines of responsibility for implementing and monitoring many of the administrative duties under the Program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Administration and some program participants have given insufficient attention and support to the business development goals of the Program and instead have focused almost entirely on the size of contract awards or the number of firms certified to participate in the Program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) many Federal procuring agencies have failed to identify and offer the necessary amount of contract support in order to allow for diversification and growth of disadvantaged businesses participating in the Program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) contract support as well as business development expenses have been misused both by the Administration and Program participants and have not been equitably distributed pursuant to objective criteria;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the widespread perception of undue political influence in the operation and administration of the Program has significantly contributed to the Program's poor image and has deterred utilization of the Program by socially and economically disadvantaged concerns and by Federal procuring agencies; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) it is imperative that increased competition and other substantial reforms be accomplished in the Program in order to promote the Congressionally mandated business development objectives and purposes.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) affirm that the measure of success of the Capital Ownership Development Program, and the section 8(a) authority, shall be the number of competitive firms that exit the Program without being unreasonably reliant on section 8(a) contracts and that are able to compete on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procurement contracts; subcontracts to disadvantaged small business concerns; performance bonds; contract negotiations; definitions; eligibility; determinations; publication; recruitment; construction subcontracts; annual estimates; Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be the duty of the Administration and it is hereby empowered, whenever it determines such action is necessary or appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to enter into contracts with the United States Government and any department, agency, or officer thereof having procurement powers obligating the Administration to furnish articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials to the Government or to perform construction work for the Government. In any case in which the Administration certifies to any officer of the Government having procurement powers that the Administration is competent and responsible to perform any specific Government procurement contract to be let by any such officer, such officer shall be authorized in his discretion to let such procurement contract to the Administration upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Administration and the procurement officer. Whenever the Administration and such procurement officer fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. Not later than 5 days from the date the Administration is notified of a procurement officer's adverse decision, the Administration may notify the contracting officer of the intent to appeal such adverse decision, and within 15 days of such date the Administrator shall file a written request for a reconsideration of the adverse decision with the Secretary of the department or agency head. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a procurement officer's adverse decision includes a decision not to make available for award pursuant to this subsection a particular procurement requirement or the failure to agree on the terms and conditions of a contract to be awarded noncompetitively under the authority of this subsection. Upon receipt of the notice of intent to appeal, the Secretary of the department or the agency head shall suspend further action regarding the procurement until a written decision on the Administrator's request for reconsideration has been issued by such Secretary or agency head, unless such officer makes a written determination that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a reconsideration of the adverse decision. If the Administrator's request for reconsideration is denied, the Secretary of the department or agency head shall specify the reasons why the selected firm was determined to be incapable to perform the procurement requirement, and the findings supporting such determination, which shall be made a part of the contract file for the requirement. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to arrange for the performance of such procurement contracts by negotiating or otherwise letting subcontracts to socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns for construction work, services, or the manufacture, supply, assembly of such articles, equipment, supplies, materials, or parts thereof, or servicing or processing in connection therewith, or such management services as may be necessary to enable the Administration to perform such contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to make an award to a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals which has completed its period of Program Participation as prescribed by section 636(j)(15) of this title, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the contract will be awarded as a result of an offer (including price) submitted in response to a published solicitation relating to a competition conducted pursuant to subparagraph (D); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the prospective contract awardee was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) A contract opportunity offered for award pursuant to this subsection shall be awarded on the basis of competition restricted to eligible Program Participants if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) there is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible Program Participants will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed $5,000,000 in the case of a contract opportunity assigned a standard industrial classification code for manufacturing and $3,000,000 (including options) in the case of all other contract opportunities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development, on a nondelegable basis, is author<!-- PDFPage:686 -->ized to approve a request from an agency to award a contract opportunity under this subsection on the basis of a competition restricted to eligible Program Participants even if the anticipated award price is not expected to exceed the dollar amounts specified in clause (i)(II). Such approvals shall be granted only on a limited basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (e) of section 3131 of title 40, no small business concern shall be required to provide any amount of any bond as a condition of receiving any subcontract under this subsection if the Administrator determines that such amount is inappropriate for such concern in performing such contract: <em>Provided</em>, That the Administrator shall exercise the authority granted by the paragraph only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Administration takes such measures as it deems appropriate for the protection of persons furnishing materials and labor to a small business receiving any benefit pursuant to this paragraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Administration assists, insofar as practicable, a small business receiving the benefits of this paragraph to develop, within a reasonable period of time, such financial and other capability as may be needed to obtain such bonds as the Administration may subsequently require for the successful completion of any program conducted under the authority of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Administration finds that such small business is unable to obtain the requisite bond or bonds from a surety and that no surety is willing to issue bond or bonds subject to the guarantee provisions of Title IV of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 692 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the small business is determined to be a start-up concern and such concern has not been participating in any program conducted under the authority of this subsection for a period exceeding one year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The authority to waive bonds provided in this paragraph (2) may not be exercised after September 30, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any Program Participant selected by the Administration to perform a contract to be let noncompetitively pursuant to this subsection shall, when practicable, participate in any negotiation of the terms and conditions of such contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) For purposes of paragraph (1) a &ldquo;fair market price&rdquo; shall be determined by the agency offering the procurement requirement to the Administration, in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a new procurement requirement, or a requirement that does not have a satisfactory procurement history, shall be derived from a price or cost analysis. Such analysis may take into account prevailing market conditions, commercial prices for similar products or services, or data obtained from any other agency. Such analysis shall consider such cost or pricing data as may be timely submitted by the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a procurement requirement that has a satisfactory procurement history shall be based on recent award prices adjusted to insure comparability. Such adjustments shall take into account differences in quantities, performance times, plans, specifications, transportation costs, packaging and packing costs, labor and materials costs, overhead costs, and any other additional costs which may be deemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An agency offering a procurement requirement for potential award pursuant to this subsection shall, upon the request of the Administration, promptly submit to the Administration a written statement detailing the method used by the agency to estimate the current fair market price for such contract, identifying the information, studies, analyses, and other data used by such agency. The agency's estimate of the current fair market price (and any supporting data furnished to the Administration) shall not be disclosed to any potential offeror (other than the Administration).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A small business concern selected by the Administration to perform or negotiate a contract to be let pursuant to this subsection may request the Administration to protest the agency's estimate of the fair market price for such contract pursuant to paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;socially and economically disadvantaged small business concern&rdquo; means any small business concern which meets the requirements of subparagraph (B) and&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Research and development are major factors in the growth and progress of industry and the national economy. The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the regular business loan program of the Small Business Administration should be reviewed by the Congress at least once every two years. It is further the sense of the Congress that the Small Business Administration should submit its estimated needs for additional authorization for such program to the Congress at least one year in advance of the date on which such authorization is to be provided, in order to assure an orderly and recurring review of such program and to avoid emergency appeals for additional authorization. Compliance by the Small Business Administration with the foregoing policy will enable the Congress on and after July 25, 1962, to provide additional authorization for such program on a two-year basis.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To effectuate the purposes of this chapter, small-business concerns within the meaning of this chapter shall receive any award or contract or any part thereof, and be awarded any contract for the sale of Government property, as to which it is determined by the Administration and the contracting procurement or disposal agency (1) to be in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full productive capacity, (2) to be in the interest of war or national defense programs, (3) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property and services for the Government in each industry category are placed with small-business concerns, or (4) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small-business concerns; but nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Government or any agency thereof. These determinations may be made for individual awards or contracts or for classes of awards or contracts. If a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business, and if the proposed procurement is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects, or the solicitation involves an unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements, as determined by the Administration, the Procurement Activity shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the Procurement Activity's Small Business Procurement Center Representative at least 30 days prior to the solicitation's issuance along with a statement explaining (1) why the proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement, (2) why delivery schedules <!-- PDFPage:733 -->cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government, (3) why the proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely, (4) why construction cannot be procured as separate discrete projects, or (5) why the agency has determined that the bundled contract (as defined in section 632(<em>o</em>) of this title) is necessary and justified. The thirty-day notification process shall occur concurrently with other processing steps required prior to issuance of the solicitation. Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed procurement and accompanying statement, if the Procurement Center Representative believes that the procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely, the Representative shall recommend to the Procurement Activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contracting opportunities. Whenever the Administration and the contracting procurement agency fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. For purposes of clause (3) of the first sentence of this subsection, an industry category is a discrete group of similar goods and services. Such groups shall be determined by the Administration in accordance with the definition of a &ldquo;United States industry&rdquo; under the North American Industry Classification System, as established by the Office of Management and Budget, except that the Administration shall limit such an industry category to a greater extent than provided under such classification codes if the Administration receives evidence indicating that further segmentation for purposes of this paragraph is warranted due to special capital equipment needs or special labor or geographic requirements or to recognize a new industry. A market for goods or services may not be segmented under the preceding sentence due to geographic requirements unless the Government typically designates the area where work for contracts for such goods or services is to be performed and Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or services and, due to the fixed location of facilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it is unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outside of the general areas where such concerns are located. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under section 694b of this title, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Programs for blind and handicapped individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As used in this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under section 46 of title 41.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;public or private organization for the handicapped&rdquo; has the same meaning given such term in section 632(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;handicapped individual&rdquo; has the same meaning given such term in section 632(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to section 47 of title 41.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provi<!-- PDFPage:734 -->sions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Procurement strategies; contract bundling</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by the various agencies having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Market research</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract containing consolidated procurement requirements, the head of an agency shall conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), consolidation of the requirements may be determined as being necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal Government would derive from the consolidation measurably substantial benefits, including any combination of benefits that, in combination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in the preceding sentence may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Cost savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Quality improvements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Better terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Any other benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reduction of costs not determinative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be substantial in relation to the dollar value of the procurement requirements to be consolidated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Strategy specifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the head of a contracting agency determines that a proposed procurement strategy for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the proposed procurement strategy shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify specifically the benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) set forth an assessment of the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements and specify actions designed to maximize small business participation as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) include a specific determination that the anticipated benefits of the proposed bundled contract justify its use.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contract teaming</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled contract that is issued by the head of an agency, a small-business concern may submit an offer that provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors for the performance of the contract. The head of the agency shall evaluate the offer in the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors. If a small business concern teams under this paragraph, it shall not affect its status as a small business concern for any other purpose.</p>

The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans shall be established at not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. The Governmentwide goal for participation by qualified HUBZone small business concerns shall be established at not less than 1 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 1999, not less than 1.5 percent of the total value of all prime contract <!-- PDFPage:735 -->awards for fiscal year 2000, not less than 2 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2001, not less than 2.5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2002, and not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for fiscal year 2003 and each fiscal year thereafter. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. Notwithstanding the Government-wide goal, each agency shall have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency. The Administration and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Government-wide prime contract goal established by the President pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of each Federal agency shall, after consultation with the Administration, establish goals for the participation by small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, by qualified HUBZone small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly established by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under such contracts. Whenever the Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be submitted to the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy for final determination. For the purpose of establishing goals under this subsection, the head of each Federal agency shall make consistent efforts to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts of the agency, including participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, by qualified HUBZone small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women.

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 702. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) many small business concerns have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to fulfill a broad range of Government requirements for products, services (including research, development, technical, and professional services), and construction, through the Federal procurement process;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) various Congressional mandated reforms to the Federal procurement process, including the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 [Pub. L. 98&ndash;369, div. B, title VII, see Tables for classification], the Defense Procurement Reform Act of 1984 [Pub. L. 98&ndash;525, title XII, see Tables for classification], and the Small Business and Federal Procurement Competition Enhancement Act of 1984 [Pub.

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) a concentration of procurement contract awards in a limited number of industry categories, often dominated by small business concerns, through the use of set-asides, for the purpose of assuring the attainment of the agency's overall small business contracting goals; and</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 711. SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is established a Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (hereafter referred to in this title as &lsquo;the Program&rsquo;) pursuant to section 15 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 413) to provide for the testing of innovative procurement methods and procedures. The Administrator of Federal Procurement Policy shall designate the Administrator of the Small Business Administration as the executive agent responsible for conducting the test.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of the Program are to demonstrate whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the competitive capabilities of small business firms in certain industry categories will enable them to successfully compete on an unrestricted basis for Federal contracting opportunities,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the use of targeted goaling and management techniques by procuring agencies, in conjunction with the Small Business Administration, can expand small business participation in Federal contracting opportunities which have been historically low, despite adequate numbers of qualified small business contractors in the economy, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) expanded use of full and open competition, as specified by the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (10 U.S.C. 2302(3) and 41 U.S.C. 403(7)), adversely affects small business participation in certain industry categories, taking into consideration the numerical dominance of small firms, the size and scope of most contracting opportunities, and the competitive capabilities of small firms.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Program Term</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Program shall commence on January 1, 1989.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Program shall apply to contract solicitations for the procurement of services in industry groups designated in section 717.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) $25,000, or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) such larger dollar amount established pursuant to paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Adjustments to the small business reserve</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the goal of awarding emerging small business concerns 15 percent of the total dollar value of contracts in a designated industry category is determined not to have been attained, upon the review of award data conducted in accordance with subsection (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, to ensure attainment of such goal, shall prescribe, on a semiannual basis, appropriate adjustments to the dollar threshold for contract opportunities in such designated industry category below which competition shall be conducted exclusively among emerging small business concerns.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Small business small purchase reserve</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirements of this subsection dealing with the reserve amount shall apply notwithstanding the amount specified in section 15(j) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(j)).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of modifications to existing contracts above the small purchase threshold</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any modification or follow-on award to a contract having an initial award value in excess of $25,000 shall not be subject to the limitations on competition required by this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Targeting Industry Categories With Limited Small Business Participation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Concurrent with the term of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, the head of each participating agency shall implement a program to expand small <!-- PDFPage:746 -->business participation in the agency's acquisition of selected products and services in 10 industry categories which have historically demonstrated low rates of small business participation. The products and services to be targeted for the small business participation expansion program and the special goals for such program, shall be developed in conjunction with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and shall be subject to the requirements of section 15(g) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(g)).</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) have significant amounts of small business productive capacity that have not been utilized by the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) In developing its small business participation expansion program, each participating agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) prepare, and furnish to the Administration, a detailed, time-phased strategy (with incremental numerical goals); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) encourage and promote joint ventures, teaming agreements and other similar arrangements, which permit small business concerns to effectively compete for contract solicitations for which an individual small business concern would lack the requisite capacity or capability needed to establish responsibility for the award of a contract.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring Agency Performance.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Participating agencies shall monitor the attainment of their small business participation goals on an annual basis.

Upon determining that its contract awards to small business concerns again meet the goals required by section 712(a), a participating agency shall promptly resume the use of unrestricted solicitations pursuant to subsection (a). Such modifications in the participating agency's solicitation practices shall be made as soon as practicable, but not later than the beginning of the quarter following completion of the review made pursuant to section 712(d) indicating that changes to solicitation practices are required.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 13, 1994, 59 F.R. 52397, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the policy of the Federal Government that a fair proportion of its contracts be placed with small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Such businesses should also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in contracts awarded by the Federal Government consistent with efficient contract performance. I am committed to the continuation of this policy. Therefore, I ask that you encourage the use of various tools, including set-asides, price preferences, and section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)), as necessary to achieve this policy objective.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;355, see Short title of 1994 Amendment note set out under section 251 of Title 41, Public Contracts] authorizes civilian agencies to utilize set-aside procurements for small disadvantaged businesses. The Act also, for the first time, establishes goals for contracting with small women-owned businesses. These provisions, along with others in the Act, will provide greater access to Federal Government business opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Department and agency heads should ensure that efforts to streamline acquisition procedures encourage the participation of these businesses in Federal procurements.</p>
