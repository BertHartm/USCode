<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any of the following companies, or for any underwriter for such a company, in connection with a public offering of any security of which such company is the issuer, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, to transmit any advertisement, pamphlet, circular, form letter, or other sales literature addressed to or intended for distribution to prospective investors unless three copies of the full text there<!-- PDFPage:450 -->of have been filed with the Commission or are filed with the Commission within ten days thereafter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any registered open-end company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any registered unit investment trust; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any registered face-amount certificate company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional requirement for prospectuses relating to periodic payment plan certificates or face-amount certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the powers relative to prospectuses granted the Commission by section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77j], the Commission is authorized to require, by rules and regulations or order, that the information contained in any prospectus relating to any periodic payment plan certificate or face-amount certificate registered under the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.], on or after the effective date of this subchapter be presented in such form and order of items, and such prospectus contain such summaries of any portion of such information, as are necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application of other provisions to securities of investment companies, face-amount certificate companies, and open-end companies or unit investment trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The exemption provided by paragraph (8) of section 3(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(8)] shall not apply to any security of which an investment company is the issuer. The exemption provided by paragraph (11) of said section 3(a) [15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(11)] shall not apply to any security of which a registered investment company is the issuer. The exemption provided by section 4(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77d(3)] shall not apply to any transaction in a security issued by a face-amount certificate company or in a redeemable security issued by an open-end management company or unit investment trust if any other security of the same class is currently being offered or sold by the issuer or by or through an underwriter in a distribution which is not exempted from section 5 of said Act [15 U.S.C. 77e], except to such extent and subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission, having due regard for the public interest and the protection of investors, may prescribe by rules or regulations with respect to any class of persons, securities, or transactions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended [15 U.S.C. 77k] the effective date of the latest amendment filed shall be deemed the effective date of the registration statement with respect to securities sold after such amendment shall have become effective. For the purposes of section 13 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended [15 U.S.C. 77m], no such security shall be deemed to have been bona fide offered to the public prior to the effective date of the latest amendment filed pursuant to this subsection. Except to the extent the Commission otherwise provides by rules or regulations as appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, no prospectus relating to a security issued by a face-amount certificate company or a redeemable security issued by an open-end management company or unit investment trust which varies for the purposes of subsection (a)(3) of section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3)] from the latest prospectus filed as a part of the registration statement shall be deemed to meet the requirements of said section 10 [15 U.S.C. 77j] unless filed as part of an amendment to the registration statement under said Act [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.] and such amendment has become effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Registration of indefinite amount of securities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Registration of securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the effective date of its registration statement, as provided by section 8 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77h], a face-amount certificate company, open-end management company, or unit investment trust, shall be deemed to have registered an indefinite amount of securities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment of registration fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year of a company or trust referred to in paragraph (1), the company or trust, as applicable, shall pay a registration fee to the Commission, calculated in the manner specified in section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77f(b)], based on the aggregate sales price for which its securities (including, for purposes of this paragraph, all securities issued pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan) were sold pursuant to a registration of an indefinite amount of securities under this subsection during the previous fiscal year of the company or trust, reduced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the aggregate redemption or repurchase price of the securities of the company or trust during that year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the aggregate redemption or repurchase price of the securities of the company or trust during any prior fiscal year ending not more than 1 year before October 11, 1996, that were not used previously by the company or trust to reduce fees payable under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Additional prospectuses</h4>
