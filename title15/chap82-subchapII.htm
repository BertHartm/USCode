<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a private space system that is used for remote sensing and other purposes, the authority of the Secretary under this subchapter shall be limited only to the remote sensing operations of such space system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with law, regulations, international obligations, and national security</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, within 6 months after October 28, 1998, shall publish in the Federal Register a complete and specific list of all information required to comprise a complete application for a license under this subchapter.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is in the interest of the United States to require such data to be provided by the licensee consistent with section 5622(b)(3) of this title, after considering the impact on the licensee and the importance of promoting widespread access to remote sensing data from United States and foreign systems.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
