<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Commerce shall charge for any service performed by the Institute, at the request of another Government agency, in compliance with any statute, enacted before, on, or after October 6, 1982, which names the Secretary or the Institute as a consultant to another Government agency, or calls upon the Secretary or the Institute to support or perform any activity for or on behalf of another Government agency, or to cooperate with any Government agency in the performance by that agency of any activity, regardless of whether the statute specifically requires reimbursement to the Secretary or the Institute by such other Government agency for such service, unless funds are specifically appropriated to the Secretary or the Institute to perform such service. The Secretary may, however, waive any charge where the service rendered by the Institute is such that the Institute will incur only nominal costs in performing it. Costs shall be determined in accordance with section 278b(e) of this title.</p>
