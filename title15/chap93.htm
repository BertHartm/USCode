<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6716. Interagency consultation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intention of the Congress that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as the umbrella supervisor for financial holding companies, and the State insurance regulators, as the functional regulators of companies engaged in insurance activities, coordinate efforts to supervise companies that control both a depository institution and a company engaged in insurance activities regulated under State law. In particular, Congress believes that the Board and the State insurance regulators should share, on a confidential basis, information relevant to the supervision of companies that control both a depository institution and a company engaged in insurance activities, including information regarding the financial health of the consolidated organization and information regarding transactions and relationships between insurance companies and affiliated depository institutions. The appropriate Federal banking agencies for depository institutions should also share, on a confidential basis, information with the relevant State insurance regulators regarding transactions and relationships between depository institutions and affiliated companies engaged in insurance activities. The purpose of this section is to encourage this coordination and confidential sharing of information, and to thereby improve both the efficiency and the quality of the supervision of financial holding companies and their affiliated depository institutions and companies engaged in insurance activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Examination results and other information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Information of the Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the Board may provide any information of the Board regarding the financial condition, risk management policies, and operations of any financial holding company that controls a company that is engaged in insurance activities and is regulated by such State insurance regulator, and regarding any transaction or relationship between such an insurance company and any affiliated depository institution. The Board may provide any other information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that the Board believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Banking agency information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any information of the agency regarding any transaction or relationship between a depository institution supervised by such Federal banking agency and any affiliated company that is engaged in insurance activities regulated by such State insurance regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any other information to the appropriate <!-- PDFPage:1642 -->State insurance regulator that the agency believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State insurance regulator information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the Board or the appropriate Federal banking agency, a State insurance regulator may provide any examination or other reports, records, or other information to which such insurance regulator may have access with respect to a company which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is engaged in insurance activities and regulated by such insurance regulator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is an affiliate of a depository institution or financial holding company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before making any determination relating to the initial affiliation of, or the continuing affiliation of, a depository institution or financial holding company with a company engaged in insurance activities, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall consult with the appropriate State insurance regulator of such company and take the views of such insurance regulator into account in making such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect on other authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall limit in any respect the authority of the appropriate Federal banking agency with respect to a depository institution or bank holding company or any affiliate thereof under any provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Confidentiality and privilege</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Confidentiality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The appropriate Federal banking agency shall not provide any information or material that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable Federal banking agency regulations, or other applicable law, to a State insurance regulator unless such regulator agrees to maintain the information or material in confidence and to take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by the regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency shall treat as confidential any information or material obtained from a State insurance regulator that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable State regulations, or other applicable law, and take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by the Federal banking agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Privilege</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provision pursuant to this section of information or material by a Federal banking agency or State insurance regulator shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege to which the information or material is otherwise subject.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appropriate Federal banking agency; depository institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms &ldquo;appropriate Federal banking agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;depository institution&rdquo; have the same meanings as in section 1813 of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Board and financial holding company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms &ldquo;Board&rdquo; and &ldquo;financial holding company&rdquo; have the same meanings as in section 1841 of title 12.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Redomestication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mutual insurer organized under the laws of any State may transfer its domicile to a transferee domicile as a step in a reorganization in which, pursuant to the laws of the transferee domicile and consistent with the standards in subsection (f) of this section, the mutual insurer becomes a stock insurer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a mutual holding company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Resulting domicile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon complying with the applicable law of the transferee domicile governing transfers of domicile and completion of a transfer pursuant to this section, the mutual insurer shall cease to be a domestic insurer in the transferor domicile and, as a continuation of its corporate exist<!-- PDFPage:1643 -->ence, shall be a domestic insurer of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Licenses preserved</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of authority, agents&rsquo; appointments and licenses, rates, approvals and other items that a licensed State allows and that are in existence immediately prior to the date that a redomesticating insurer transfers its domicile pursuant to this subchapter shall continue in full force and effect upon transfer, if the insurer remains duly qualified to transact the business of insurance in such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effectiveness of outstanding policies and contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All outstanding insurance policies and annuities contracts of a redomesticating insurer shall remain in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the new domicile of the insurer, unless so ordered by the State insurance regulator of a licensed State, and then only in the case of outstanding policies and contracts whose owners reside in such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Applicable State law may require a redomesticating insurer to file new policy forms with the State insurance regulator of a licensed State on or before the effective date of the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a redomesticating insurer may use existing policy forms with appropriate endorsements to reflect the new domicile of the redomesticating insurer until the new policy forms are approved for use by the State insurance regulator of such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A redomesticating insurer shall give notice of the proposed transfer to the State insurance regulator of each licensed State and shall file promptly any resulting amendments to corporate documents required to be filed by a foreign licensed mutual insurer with the insurance regulator of each such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Procedural requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mutual insurer may redomesticate to another State and reorganize into a mutual holding company pursuant to this section unless the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile determines that the plan of reorganization of the insurer includes the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval by board of directors and policyholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reorganization is approved by at least a majority of the board of directors of the mutual insurer and at least a majority of the policyholders who vote after notice, disclosure of the reorganization and the effects of the transaction on policyholder contractual rights, and reasonable opportunity to vote, in accordance with such notice, disclosure, and voting procedures as are approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Continued voting control by policyholders; review of public stock offering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the consummation of a reorganization, the policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall have the same voting rights with respect to the mutual holding company as they had before the reorganization with respect to the mutual insurer. With respect to an initial public offering of stock, the offering shall be conducted in compliance with applicable securities laws and in a manner approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Award of stock or grant of options to officers and directors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the applicable period provided for under the State law of the transferee domicile following completion of an initial public offering, or for a period of six months if no such applicable period is provided, neither a stock holding company nor the converted insurer shall award any stock options or stock grants to persons who are elected officers or directors of the mutual holding company, the stock holding company, or the converted insurer, except with respect to any such awards or options to which a person is entitled as a policyholder and as approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Policyholder rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon reorganization into a mutual holding company, the contractual rights of the policyholders are preserved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Fair and equitable treatment of policyholders</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the activities of, taking action against, or applying any provision of law or regulation to, any insured or any insurance licensee or other intermediary because such person has procured insurance from or placed insurance with any insurer or affiliate of such insurer that plans to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this subchapter, but only to the extent that such law would treat such insured licensee or other intermediary differently than if the person procured insur<!-- PDFPage:1644 -->ance from, or placed insurance with, an insured licensee or other intermediary which had not redomesticated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any law that has the purpose or effect of terminating, because of the redomestication of a mutual insurer pursuant to this subchapter, any certificate of authority, agent appointment or license, rate approval, or other approval, of any State insurance regulator or other State authority in existence immediately prior to the redomestication in any State other than the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Differential treatment prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State law, regulation, interpretation, or functional equivalent thereof, of a State other than a transferee domicile may treat a redomesticating or redomesticated insurer or any affiliate thereof any differently than an insurer operating in that State that is not a redomesticating or redomesticated insurer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Laws prohibiting operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any licensed State fails to issue, delays the issuance of, or seeks to revoke an original or renewal certificate of authority of a redomesticated insurer promptly following redomestication, except on grounds and in a manner consistent with its past practices regarding the issuance of certificates of authority to foreign insurers that are not redomesticating, then the redomesticating insurer shall be exempt from any State law of the licensed State to the extent that such State law or the operation of such State law would make unlawful, or regulate, directly or indirectly, the operation of the redomesticated insurer, except that such licensed State may require the redomesticated insurer to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this subchapter shall take effect unless, not later than 3 years after November 12, 1999, at least a majority of the States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have enacted uniform laws and regulations governing the licensure of individuals and entities authorized to sell and solicit the purchase of insurance within the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) have enacted reciprocity laws and regulations governing the licensure of nonresident individuals and entities authorized to sell and solicit insurance within those States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniformity required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">States shall be deemed to have established the uniformity necessary to satisfy subsection (a)(1) of this section if the States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish uniform criteria regarding the integrity, personal qualifications, education, training, and experience of licensed insurance producers, including the qualification and training of sales personnel in ascertaining the appropriateness of a particular insurance product for a prospective customer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish uniform continuing education requirements for licensed insurance producers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establish uniform ethics course requirements for licensed insurance producers in conjunction with the continuing education requirements under paragraph (2);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) do not impose any requirement upon any insurance producer to be licensed or otherwise qualified to do business as a nonresident that has the effect of limiting or conditioning that producer's activities because of its residence or place of operations, except that countersignature requirements imposed on nonresident producers shall not be deemed to have the effect of limiting or conditioning a producer's activities because of its residence or place of operations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reciprocity required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">States shall be deemed to have established the reciprocity required to satisfy subsection (a)(2) of this section if the following conditions are met:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1646 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Administrative licensing procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At least a majority of the States permit a producer that has a resident license for selling or soliciting the purchase of insurance in its home State to receive a license to sell or solicit the purchase of insurance in such majority of States as a nonresident to the same extent that such producer is permitted to sell or solicit the purchase of insurance in its State, if the producer's home State also awards such licenses on such a reciprocal basis, without satisfying any additional requirements other than submitting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a request for licensure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the application for licensure that the producer submitted to its home State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) proof that the producer is licensed and in good standing in its home State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the payment of any requisite fee to the appropriate authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Continuing education requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A majority of the States accept an insurance producer's satisfaction of its home State's continuing education requirements for licensed insurance producers to satisfy the States&rsquo; own continuing education requirements if the producer's home State also recognizes the satisfaction of continuing education requirements on such a reciprocal basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No limiting nonresident requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A majority of the States do not impose any requirement upon any insurance producer to be licensed or otherwise qualified to do business as a nonresident that has the effect of limiting or conditioning that producer's activities because of its residence or place of operations, except that countersignature requirements imposed on nonresident producers shall not be deemed to have the effect of limiting or conditioning a producer's activities because of its residence or place of operations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reciprocal reciprocity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each of the States that satisfies paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) grants reciprocity to residents of all of the other States that satisfy such paragraphs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) NAIC determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the end of the 3-year period beginning on November 12, 1999, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;NAIC&rdquo;) shall determine, in consultation with the insurance commissioners or chief insurance regulatory officials of the States, whether the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section has been achieved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The appropriate United States district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any challenge to the NAIC's determination under this section and such court shall apply the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5 when reviewing any such challenge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continued application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time, the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section no longer exists, the provisions of this subchapter shall take effect 2 years after the date on which such uniformity or reciprocity ceases to exist, unless the uniformity or reciprocity required by those provisions is satisfied before the expiration of that 2-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Savings provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring that any law, regulation, provision, or action of any State which purports to regulate insurance producers, including any such law, regulation, provision, or action which purports to regulate unfair trade practices or establish consumer protections, including countersignature laws, be altered or amended in order to satisfy the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section, unless any such law, regulation, provision, or action is inconsistent with a specific requirement of any such subsection and then only to the extent of such inconsistency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Uniform licensing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any State to adopt new or additional licensing requirements to achieve the uniformity necessary to satisfy subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of classes and categories</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Classes of membership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Association may establish separate classes of membership, with separate criteria, if the Association reasonably determines that performance of different duties requires different levels of education, training, or experience.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Categories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Association may establish separate categories of membership for individuals and for other persons. The establishment of any such categories of membership shall be based either on the types of licensing categories that exist under State laws or on the aggregate amount of business handled by an insurance producer. No special categories of membership, and no distinct membership criteria, shall be established for members which are depository institutions or for their employees, agents, or affiliates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Membership criteria</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Suspension and revocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Association may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inspect and examine the records and offices of the members of the Association to determine compliance with the criteria for membership established by the Association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) suspend or revoke the membership of an insurance producer if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the producer fails to meet the applicable membership criteria of the Association; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the producer has been subject to disciplinary action pursuant to a final adjudicatory proceeding under the jurisdiction of a State insurance regulator, and the Association concludes that retention of membership in the Association would not be in the public interest.</p>
