<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Advances for customers&rsquo; claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to provide for prompt payment and satisfaction of net equity claims of customers of the debtor, SIPC shall advance to the trustee such moneys, not to exceed $500,000 for each customer, as may be required to pay or otherwise satisfy claims for the amount by which the net equity of each customer exceeds his ratable share of customer property, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if all or any portion of the net equity claim of a customer in excess of his ratable share of customer property is a claim for cash, as distinct from a claim for securities or options on commodity futures contracts, the amount advanced to satisfy such claim for cash shall not exceed the standard maximum cash advance amount for each such customer, as determined in accordance with subsection (d);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a customer who holds accounts with the debtor in separate capacities shall be deemed to be a different customer in each capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if all or any portion of the net equity claim of a customer in excess of his ratable share of customer property is satisfied by the delivery of securities purchased by the trustee pursuant to section 78fff&ndash;2(d) of this title, the securities so purchased shall be valued as of the filing date for purposes of applying the dollar limitations of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) no advance shall be made by SIPC to the trustee to pay or otherwise satisfy, directly or indirectly, any net equity claim of a customer who is a general partner, officer, or director of the debtor, a beneficial owner of five per centum or more of any class of equity security of the debtor (other than a nonconvertible stock having fixed preferential dividend and liquidation rights), a limited partner with a participation of five per centum or more in the net assets or net profits of the debtor, or a person who, directly or indirectly and through agreement or otherwise, exercised or had the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the debtor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) no advance shall be made by SIPC to the trustee to pay or otherwise satisfy any net equity claim of any customer who is a broker or dealer or bank, other than to the extent that it shall be established to the satisfaction of the trustee, from the books and records of the debtor or from the books and records of a broker or dealer or bank, or otherwise, that <!-- PDFPage:439 -->the net equity claim of such broker or dealer or bank against the debtor arose out of transactions for customers of such broker or dealer or bank (which customers are not themselves a broker or dealer or bank or a person described in paragraph (4)), in which event each such customer of such broker or dealer or bank shall be deemed a separate customer of the debtor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent moneys are advanced by SIPC to the trustee to pay or otherwise satisfy the claims of customers, in addition to all other rights it may have at law or in equity, SIPC shall be subrogated to the claims of such customers with the rights and priorities provided in this chapter, except that SIPC as subrogee may assert no claim against customer property until after the allocation thereof to customers as provided in section 78fff&ndash;2(c) of this title.</p>

If the Board of Directors of SIPC determines such an adjustment is appropriate, then the standard maximum cash advance amount shall be an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rounding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the standard maximum cash advance amount determined under paragraph (1) for any period is not a multiple of $10,000, the amount so determined shall be rounded down to the nearest $10,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Publication and report to the Congress</h4>
