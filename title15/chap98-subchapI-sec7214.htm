<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inspection frequency</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments to schedules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may, by rule, adjust the inspection schedules set under paragraph (1) if the Board finds that different inspection schedules are consistent with the purposes of this Act, the public interest, and the protection of investors. The Board may conduct special inspections at the request of the Commission or upon its own motion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall, in each inspection under this section, and in accordance with its rules for such inspections&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify any act or practice or omission to act by the registered public accounting firm, or by any associated person thereof, revealed by such inspection that may be in violation of this Act, the rules of the Board, the rules of the Commission, the firm's own quality control policies, or professional standards;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1758 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) report any such act, practice, or omission, if appropriate, to the Commission and each appropriate State regulatory authority; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Procedures for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rules of the Board shall provide a procedure for the review of and response to a draft inspection report by the registered public accounting firm under inspection. The Board shall take such action with respect to such response as it considers appropriate (including revising the draft report or continuing or supplementing its inspection activities before issuing a final report), but the text of any such response, appropriately redacted to protect information reasonably identified by the accounting firm as confidential, shall be attached to and made part of the inspection report.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) made available in appropriate detail to the public (subject to section 7215(b)(5)(A) of this title, and to the protection of such confidential and proprietary information as the Board may determine to be appropriate, or as may be required by law), except that no portions of the inspection report that deal with criticisms of or potential defects in the quality control systems of the firm under inspection shall be made public if those criticisms or defects are addressed by the firm, to the satisfaction of the Board, not later than 12 months after the date of the inspection report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Interim Commission review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reviewable matters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A registered public accounting firm may seek review by the Commission, pursuant to such rules as the Commission shall promulgate, if the firm&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has provided the Board with a response, pursuant to rules issued by the Board under subsection (f) of this section, to the substance of particular items in a draft inspection report, and disagrees with the assessments contained in any final report prepared by the Board following such response; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) disagrees with the determination of the Board that criticisms or defects identified in an inspection report have not been addressed to the satisfaction of the Board within 12 months of the date of the inspection report, for purposes of subsection (g)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any decision of the Commission with respect to a review under paragraph (1) shall not be reviewable under section 78y of this title, or deemed to be &ldquo;final agency action&rdquo; for purposes of section 704 of title 5.</p>
