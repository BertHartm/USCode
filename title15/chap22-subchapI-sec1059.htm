Such application may be made at any time within 1 year before the end of each successive 10-year period for which the registration was issued or renewed, or it may be made within a grace period of 6 months after the end of each successive 10-year period, upon payment of a fee and surcharge prescribed therefor. If any application filed under this section is deficient, the deficiency may be corrected within the time prescribed after notification of the deficiency, upon payment of a surcharge prescribed therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification of refusal of renewal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Director refuses to renew the registration, the Director shall notify the registrant of the Commissioner's&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1059_1_target" name="1059_1">1</a></sup> refusal and the reasons therefor.</p>

Such notices or process may be served upon the person so designated by leaving with that person or mailing to that person a copy thereof at the address specified in the last designation so filed.
