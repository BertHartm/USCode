<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Study on effects of position limits on trading on exchanges in the United States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in consultation with each entity that is a designated contract market under the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.], shall conduct a study of the effects (if any) of the position limits imposed pursuant to the other provisions of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8307_1_target" name="8307_1">1</a></sup> on excessive speculation and on the movement of transactions from exchanges in the United States to trading venues outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Report to the Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 12 months after the imposition of position limits pursuant to the other provisions of this title,<sup><a href="#8307_1_target" name="8307_1">1</a></sup> the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in consultation with each entity that is a designated contract market under the Commodity Exchange Act, shall submit to the Congress a report on the matters described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Required hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 30 legislative days after the submission to the Congress of the report described in paragraph (2), the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives shall hold a hearing examining the findings of the report.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Biennial reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the study required in paragraph (1), the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall prepare and submit to the Congress biennial reports on the growth or decline of the derivatives markets in the United States and abroad, which shall include assessments of the causes of any such growth or decline, the effectiveness of regulatory regimes in managing systemic risk, a comparison of the costs of compliance at the time of the report for market participants subject to regulation by the United States with the costs of compliance in December 2008 for the market participants, and the quality of the available data. In preparing the report, the Chairman shall solicit the views of, consult with, and address the concerns raised by, market participants, regulators, legislators, and other interested parties.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2071 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Study on feasibility of requiring use of standardized algorithmic descriptions for financial derivatives</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall conduct a joint study of the feasibility of requiring the derivatives industry to adopt standardized computer-readable algorithmic descriptions which may be used to describe complex and standardized financial derivatives.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The algorithmic descriptions defined in the study shall be designed to facilitate computerized analysis of individual derivative contracts and to calculate net exposures to complex derivatives.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) commercial users and traders of derivatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) derivative clearing houses, exchanges and electronic trading platforms;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) systemic risk regulators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The study will also examine the extent to which the algorithmic description, together with standardized and extensible legal definitions, may serve as the binding legal definition of derivative contracts. The study will examine the logistics of possible implementations of standardized algorithmic descriptions for derivatives contracts. The study shall be limited to electronic formats for exchange of derivative contract descriptions and will not contemplate disclosure of proprietary valuation models.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) International coordination</h4>

In making the determination required under this subparagraph, the Commissions jointly shall consult with the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, and the State entities that regulate the issuers of stable value contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commissions determine that stable value contracts fall within the definition of a swap, the Commissions jointly shall determine if an exemption for stable value contracts from the definition of swap is appropriate and in the public interest.
