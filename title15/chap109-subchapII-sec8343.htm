<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to mitigate conflicts of interest, not later than 180 days after July 21, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall adopt rules which may include numerical limits on the control of, or the voting rights with respect to, any clearing agency that clears security-based swaps, or on the control of any security-based swap execution facility or national securities exchange that posts or makes available for trading security-based swaps, by a bank holding company (as defined in section 1841 of title 12) with total consolidated assets of $50,000,000,000 or more, a nonbank financial company (as defined in section 5311 of title 12) supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, affiliate of such a bank holding company or nonbank financial company, a security-based swap dealer, major security-based swap participant, or person associated with a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Securities and Exchange Commission shall adopt rules if the Commission determines, after the review described in subsection (a), that <!-- PDFPage:2061 -->such rules are necessary or appropriate to improve the governance of, or to mitigate systemic risk, promote competition, or mitigate conflicts of interest in connection with a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant's conduct of business with, a clearing agency, national securities exchange, or security-based swap execution facility that clears, posts, or makes available for trading security-based swaps and in which such security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has a material debt or equity investment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In adopting rules pursuant to this section, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall consider any conflicts of interest arising from the amount of equity owned by a single investor, the ability to vote, cause the vote of, or withhold votes entitled to be cast on any matters by the holders of the ownership interest, and the governance arrangements of any derivatives clearing organization that clears swaps, or swap execution facility or board of trade designated as a contract market that posts swaps or makes swaps available for trading.</p>
