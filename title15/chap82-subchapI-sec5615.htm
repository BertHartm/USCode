<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Landsat 7 data policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Landsat Program Management, in consultation with other appropriate United States Government agencies, shall develop a data policy for Landsat 7 which should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensure that unenhanced data are available to all users at the cost of fulfilling user requests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) ensure timely and dependable delivery of unenhanced data to the full spectrum of civilian, national security, commercial, and foreign users and the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that the United States retains ownership of all unenhanced data generated by Landsat 7;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) support the development of the commercial market for remote sensing data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ensure that the provision of commercial value-added services based on remote sensing data remains exclusively the function of the private sector; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to the extent possible, ensure that the data distribution system for Landsat 7 is compatible with the Earth Observing System Data and Information System.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional data policy considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition, the data policy for Landsat 7 may provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) United States private sector entities to operate ground receiving stations in the United States for Landsat 7 data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) other means for direct access by private sector entities to unenhanced data from Landsat 7; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the United States Government to charge a per image fee, license fee, or other such fee to entities operating ground receiving stations or distributing Landsat 7 data.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Landsat 7 Data Policy Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than July 15, 1994, the Landsat Program Management shall develop and submit to Congress a report that contains a Landsat 7 Data Policy Plan. This plan shall define the roles and responsibilities of the various public and private sector entities that would be involved in the acquisition, processing, distribution, and archiving of Landsat 7 data and in operations of the Landsat 7 spacecraft.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 12 months after submission of the Landsat 7 Data Policy Plan, required by subsection (c) of this section, and annually thereafter until the launch of Landsat 7, the Landsat Program Management, in consultation with representatives of appropriate United States Government agencies, shall prepare and submit a report to the Congress which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides justification for the Landsat 7 data policy in terms of the civilian, national security, commercial, and foreign policy needs of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides justification for any elements of the Landsat 7 data policy which are not consistent with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
