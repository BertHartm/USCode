<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for any importer to purchase,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">any shipment of fasteners which are manufactured outside the United States unless delivery of such shipment to such importer is accompanied by a manufacturer's certificate as described in subsection (a) of this section, an original laboratory testing report described in section 5404(c) of this title, with respect to each lot from which such fasteners were taken, and any other relevant lot identification information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The requirement under paragraph (1) of this subsection that the delivery of such a shipment to such importer be accompanied by an original laboratory testing report shall not apply in the case of fasteners imported into the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as products manufactured within a nation which is party to a congressionally-approved free trade agreement with the United States that is in effect, so long as the Secretary certifies that satisfactory arrangements have been reached by which purchasers within the United States can readily gain access to an original laboratory testing report for such fasteners; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alterations subsequent to manufacture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who significantly alters a fastener so that such fastener no longer conforms to the description in the relevant certificate issued under section 5404(c) of this title, and who thereafter offers for sale or sells such altered fastener, shall be treated as a manufacturer for purposes of this chapter and shall cause such altered fastener to be inspected and tested under section 5404 of this title or this section as though it were newly manufactured, unless delivery of such fastener to the purchaser is accompanied by a written statement noting the original lot number, disclosing the subsequent alteration, and warning that such alteration may affect the dimensional or physical characteristics of the fastener.</p>
