<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exempt telecommunications company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;exempt telecommunications company&rdquo; means any person determined by the Federal Communications Commission to be engaged directly or indirectly, wherever located, through one or more affiliates (as defined in section 79b(a)(11)(B) of this title), and exclusively in the business of providing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) telecommunications services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) information services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) other services or products subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) products or services that are related or incidental to the provision of a product or service described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">No person shall be deemed to be an exempt telecommunications company under this section unless such person has applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a determination under this paragraph. A person applying in good faith for such a determination shall be deemed an exempt telecommunications company under this section, with all of the exemptions provided by this section, until the Federal Communications Commission makes such determination. The Federal Communications Commission shall make such determination within 60 days of its receipt of any such application filed after February 8, 1996, and shall notify the Commission whenever a determination is made under this paragraph that any person is an exempt tele<!-- PDFPage:398 -->communications company. Not later than 12 months after February 8, 1996, the Federal Communications Commission shall promulgate rules implementing the provisions of this paragraph which shall be applicable to applications filed under this paragraph after the effective date of such rules.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the terms &ldquo;telecommunications services&rdquo; and &ldquo;information services&rdquo; shall have the same meanings as provided in the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State consent for sale of existing rate-based facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a rate or charge for the sale of electric energy or natural gas (other than any portion of a rate or charge which represents recovery of the cost of a wholesale rate or charge) for, or in connection with, assets of a public utility company that is an associate company or affiliate of a registered holding company was in effect under the laws of any State as of December 19, 1995, the public utility company owning such assets may not sell such assets to an exempt telecommunications company that is an associate company or affiliate unless State commissions having jurisdiction over such public utility company approve such sale. Nothing in this subsection shall preempt the otherwise applicable authority of any State to approve or disapprove the sale of such assets. The approval of the Commission under this chapter shall not be required for the sale of assets as provided in this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Ownership of ETCS by exempt holding companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a holding company that is exempt under section 79c of this title shall be permitted, without condition or limitation under this chapter, to acquire and maintain an interest in the business of one or more exempt telecommunications companies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Ownership of ETCS by registered holding companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a registered holding company shall be permitted (without the need to apply for, or receive, approval from the Commission, and otherwise without condition under this chapter) to acquire and hold the securities, or an interest in the business, of one or more exempt telecommunications companies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Financing and other relationships between ETCS and registered holding companies</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 79k of this title shall not prohibit the ownership of an interest in the business of one or more exempt telecommunications companies by a registered holding company (regardless of activities engaged in or where facilities owned or operated by such exempt telecommunications companies are located), and such ownership by a registered holding company shall be deemed consistent with the operation of an integrated public utility system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the ownership of an interest in the business of one or more exempt telecommunications companies by a registered holding company (regardless of activities engaged in or where facilities owned or operated by such exempt telecommunications companies are located) shall be considered as reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate, to the operations of an integrated public utility system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Commission shall have no jurisdiction under this chapter over, and there shall be no restriction or approval required under this chapter with respect to (A) the issue or sale of a security by a registered holding company for purposes of financing the acquisition of an exempt telecommunications company, or (B) the guarantee of a security of an exempt telecommunications company by a registered holding company; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) except for costs that should be fairly and equitably allocated among companies that are associate companies of a registered holding company, the Commission shall have no jurisdiction under this chapter over the sales, service, and construction contracts between an exempt telecommunications company and a registered holding company, its affiliates and associate companies.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to require additional information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, based on reports provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or other available information, the Commission reasonably concludes that it has concerns regarding the financial or operational condition of any registered holding company or any subsidiary thereof (including an exempt telecommunications company), the Commission may require such registered holding company to make additional reports and provide additional information.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Pledging or mortgaging of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any public utility company that is an associate company, or affiliate, of a registered holding company and that is subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to its retail electric or gas rates shall not pledge, mortgage, or otherwise use as collateral any assets of the public utility company or assets of any subsidiary company thereof for the benefit of an exempt telecommunications company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Protection against abusive affiliate transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A public utility company may enter into a contract to purchase services or products described in subsection (a)(1) of this section from an exempt telecommunications company that is an affiliate or associate company of the public utility company only if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Nonpreemption of rate authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or a State commission from exercising its jurisdiction under otherwise applicable law to determine whether a public utility company may recover in rates the costs of products or services purchased from or sold to an associate company or affiliate that is an exempt telecommunications company, regardless of whether such costs are incurred through the direct or indirect purchase or sale of products or services from such associate company or affiliate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reciprocal arrangements prohibited</h4>
