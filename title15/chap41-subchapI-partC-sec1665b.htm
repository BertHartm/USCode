<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Loan fees and opening cost estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any loan fee the amount of which is determined as a percentage of the credit limit applicable to an account under the plan and an estimate of the aggregate amount of other fees for opening the account, based on the creditor's experience with the plan and stated as a single amount or as a reasonable range.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Periodic rates</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tax deductibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any advertisement described in subsection (a) of this section contains a statement that any interest expense incurred with respect to the plan is or may be tax deductible, the advertisement shall not be misleading with respect to such deductibility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain terms prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No advertisement described in subsection (a) of this section with respect to any home equity account may refer to such loan as &ldquo;free money&rdquo; or use other terms determined by the Board by regulation to be misleading.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any advertisement described in subsection (a) of this section includes an initial annual percentage rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments, the advertisement shall also state with equal prominence the current annual percentage rate that would have been applied using the index or formula if such initial rate had not been offered.</p>
