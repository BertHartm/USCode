<p class="statutory-body">The total amount of obligations purchased and outstanding at any one time by the Administration under this section from any one State development company shall not exceed the total amount borrowed by it from all other sources.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) enhanced economic competition, including the advancement of technology, plan retooling, conversion to robotics, or competition with imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) changes necessitated by Federal budget cutbacks, including defense related industries, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) business restructuring arising from Federally mandated standards or policies affecting the environment or the safety and health of employees.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prepayment authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (b) of this section, an issuer of a debenture purchased by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter may, at the election of the borrower (in the case of a loan under section 697 of this title) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) and with the approval of the Administration, prepay such debenture in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a prepayment under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the borrower (in the case of a loan under section 697 of this title) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank an amount that is equal to the sum of the unpaid principal balance due on the debenture as of the date of the prepayment (plus accrued interest at the coupon rate on the debenture) and the amount of the repurchase premium described in subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Administration shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank the difference between the repurchase premium paid by the borrower under this subsection and the repurchase premium that the Federal Financing Bank would otherwise have received.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repurchase premium</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the repurchase premium is the amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the applicable percentage rate, as determined in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicable percentage rate</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustments to applicable percentage rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The percentage rates described in clause (ii) shall be increased or decreased by the Administration by a factor not to exceed one-third, if the same factor is applied in each case and if the Administration determines that an adjustment is necessary, based on the number of borrowers having given notice of their intent to participate, in order to make the program (including the amounts appropriated for this purpose under Public Law 103&ndash;317) result in no substantial net gain or loss of revenue to the Federal Financing Bank or to the Administration. Amounts collected in excess of the amount necessary to ensure revenue neutrality shall be refunded to the borrowers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the requirements of this subsection are that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) No prepayment fees or penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No fees or penalties other than those specified in this section may be imposed on the issuer, the borrower, the Administration, or any fund or account administered by the Administration as the result of a prepayment under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The refinancing of a debenture under sections 697a and 697b of this title, in accordance with subsection (b)(2) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall not exceed the amount necessary to prepay existing debentures, including all costs associated with the refinancing and any applicable prepayment penalty or repurchase premium; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), shall be subject to the provisions of sections 697a and 697b of this title and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including rules and regulations governing payment of authorized expenses, commissions, fees, and discounts to brokers and <!-- PDFPage:848 -->dealers in trust certificates issued pursuant to section 697b of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) New debentures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Issuers of debentures under subchapter III of this chapter may issue new debentures in accordance with such subchapter in order to prepay existing debentures as authorized in this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administration shall use certified mail and other reasonable means to notify each eligible borrower of the prepayment program provided in this subchapter. Each preliminary notice shall specify the range and dollar amount of repurchase premiums which could be required of that borrower in order to participate in the program. In carrying out this program, the Administration shall provide a period of not less than 45 days following the receipt of such notice by the borrower during which the borrower must notify the Administration of the borrower's intent to participate in the program. The Administration shall require that a borrower who gives notice of its intent to participate to make an earnest money deposit of $1,000 which shall not be refundable but which shall be credited toward the final repurchase premium.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Borrower&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;borrower&rdquo;, in the case of a small business investment company or a specialized small business investment company, means &ldquo;issuer&rdquo;.</p>
