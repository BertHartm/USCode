<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby finds and declares that the purpose of this subchapter is to foster economic development and to create or preserve job opportunities in both urban and rural areas by providing long-term financing for small business concerns through the development company program authorized by this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Loans; obligations of development companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration is authorized to make loans to State development companies to assist in carrying out the purposes of this chapter. Any funds advanced under this subsection shall be in exchange for obligations of the development company which bear interest at such rate, and contain such other terms, as the Administration may fix, and funds may be so advanced without regard to the use and investment by the development company of funds secured by it from other sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maximum loans to development companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total amount of obligations purchased and outstanding at any one time by the Administration under this section from any one State development company shall not exceed the total amount borrowed by it from all other sources. Funds advanced to a State development company under this section shall be treated on an equal basis with those funds borrowed by such company after August 21, 1958, regardless of source, which have the highest priority, except when this requirement is waived by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility for assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to qualify for assistance under this subchapter, the development company must demonstrate that the project to be funded is directed toward at least one of the following economic development objectives&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the creation of job opportunities within two years of the completion of the project or the preservation or retention of jobs attributable to the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improving the economy of the locality, such as stimulating other business development in the community, bringing new income into the area, or assisting the community in diversifying and stabilizing its economy; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the achievement of one or more of the following public policy goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) business district revitalization,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expansion of exports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) expansion of minority business development,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) rural development,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enhanced economic competition, including the advancement of technology, plan retooling, conversion to robotics, or competition with imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) changes necessitated by Federal budget cutbacks, including defense related industries, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) business restructuring arising from Federally mandated standards or policies affecting the environment or the safety and health of employees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If eligibility is based upon the criteria set forth in paragraph (2) or (3), the project need not meet the job creation or job preservation criteria developed by the Administration if the overall portfolio of the development company meets or exceeds such job creation or retention criteria.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prepayment authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (b) of this section, an issuer of a debenture purchased by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter may, at the election of the borrower (in the case of a loan under section 697 of this title) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) and with the approval of the Administration, prepay such debenture in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a prepayment under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the borrower (in the case of a loan under section 697 of this title) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank an amount that is equal to the sum of the unpaid principal balance due on the debenture as of the date of the prepayment (plus accrued interest at the coupon rate on the debenture) and the amount of the repurchase premium described in subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Administration shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank the difference between the repurchase premium paid by the borrower under this subsection and the repurchase premium that the Federal Financing Bank would otherwise have received.</p>

Amounts collected in excess of the amount necessary to ensure revenue neutrality shall be refunded to the borrowers.</p>
