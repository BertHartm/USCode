<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Short Title</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) cigarette-ignited fires are the leading cause of fire deaths in the United States,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in 1987, there were 1,492 deaths from cigarette-ignited fires, 3,809 serious injuries, and $395,000,000 in property damage caused by such fires,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 [set out below] determined that (A) it is technically feasible and may be commercially feasible to develop a cigarette that will have a significantly reduced propensity to ignite furniture and mattresses, and (B) the overall impact on other aspects of the United States society and economy may be minimal,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1156 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 further determined that the value of a cigarette with less of a likelihood to ignite furniture and mattresses which would prevent property damage and personal injury and loss of life is economically incalculable,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) it is appropriate for the Congress to require by law the completion of the research described in the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety and an assessment of the practicability of developing a performance standard to reduce cigarette ignition propensity, and</p>
