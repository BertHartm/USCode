If any accountant, engineer, or appraiser, or any person whose profession gives authority to a statement made by him, is named as having prepared or certified any part of the registration statement, or is named as having prepared or certified a report or valuation for use in connection with the registration statement, the written consent of such person shall be filed with the registration statement. If any such person is named as having prepared or certified a report or valuation (other than a public official document or statement) which is used in connection with the registration statement, but is not named as having prepared or certified such report or valuation for use in connection with the registration statement, the written consent of such person shall be filed with the registration statement unless the Commission dispenses with such filing as impracticable or as involving undue hardship on the person filing the registration statement.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide a right of rescission to shareholders of such securities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may, as it determines consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors, by rule or order exempt any issuer or class of issuers from the rules prescribed under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;blank check company&rdquo; means any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock (within the meaning of section 78c(a)(51) of this title) and that&mdash;</p>
