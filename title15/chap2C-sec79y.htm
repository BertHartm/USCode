<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">As originally enacted section contained references to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Act June 25, 1936, substituted &ldquo;the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia&rdquo;. Pub. L. 100&ndash;181 struck out reference to the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia. Previously, act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May 24, 1949, had substituted &ldquo;United States District Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; for &ldquo;district court of the United States for the District of Columbia&rdquo;, but such words had been editorially eliminated as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which provides that &ldquo;There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district&rdquo;, and section 88 of title 28 which provides that &ldquo;the District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district&rdquo;.</p>
