<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall prescribe regulations applicable to each consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a(w) of this title to require the establishment of a streamlined process for consumers to request consumer reports under subparagraph (A), which shall include, at a minimum, the establishment by each such agency of a toll-free telephone number for such requests.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In prescribing regulations under clause (i), the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the significant demands that may be placed on consumer reporting agencies in providing such consumer reports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) appropriate means to ensure that consumer reporting agencies can satisfactorily meet those demands, including the efficacy of a system of staggering the availability to consumers of such consumer reports; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exception for first 12 months of operation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency that has not been furnishing consumer reports to third parties on a continuing basis during the 12-month period preceding a request under paragraph (1), with respect to consumers residing nationwide.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Free disclosure after adverse notice to consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each consumer reporting agency that maintains a file on a consumer shall make all disclosures pursuant to section 1681g of this title without charge to the consumer if, not later than 60 days after receipt by such consumer of a notification pursuant to section 1681m of this title, or <!-- PDFPage:1205 -->of a notification from a debt collection agency affiliated with that consumer reporting agency stating that the consumer's credit rating may be or has been adversely affected, the consumer makes a request under section 1681g of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the request of the consumer, a consumer reporting agency shall make all disclosures pursuant to section 1681g of this title once during any 12-month period without charge to that consumer if the consumer certifies in writing that the consumer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is unemployed and intends to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the certification is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is a recipient of public welfare assistance; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not exceed $8; and</p>
