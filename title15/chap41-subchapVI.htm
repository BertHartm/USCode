<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rights and liabilities undefined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the use of electronic systems to transfer funds provides the potential for substantial benefits to consumers. However, due to the unique characteristics of such systems, the application of existing consumer protection legislation is unclear, leaving the rights and liabilities of consumers, financial institutions, and intermediaries in electronic fund transfers undefined.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1429 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide a basic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund and remittance transfer systems. The primary objective of this subchapter, however, is the provision of individual consumer rights.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prepare an analysis of economic impact which considers the costs and benefits to financial institutions, consumers, and other users of electronic fund transfers, including the extent to which additional documentation, reports, records, or other paper work would be required, and the effects upon competition in the provision of electronic banking services among large and small financial institutions and the availability of such services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent practicable, the Board shall demonstrate that the consumer protections of the proposed regulations outweigh the compliance costs imposed upon consumers and financial institutions, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of model clauses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall issue model clauses for optional use by financial institutions to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of section 1693c of this title and to aid consumers in understanding the rights and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfers by utilizing readily understandable language.

With respect to the disclosures required by section 1693c(a)(3) and (4) of this title, the Board shall take account of variations in the services and charges under different electronic fund transfer systems and, as appropriate, shall issue alternative model clauses for disclosure of these differing account terms.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) indicates the consumer's belief that the documentation, or, in the case of notification pursuant to section 1693d(b) of this title, the consumer's account, contains an error and the amount of such error; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sets forth the reasons for the consumer's belief (where applicable) that an error has occurred,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the financial institution shall investigate the alleged error, determine whether an error has occurred, and report or mail the results of such investigation and determination to the consumer within ten business days. The financial institution may require written confirmation to be provided to it within ten business days of an oral notification of error if, when the oral notification is made, the consumer is advised of such requirement and the address to which such confirmation should be sent. A financial institution which requires written confirmation in accordance with the previous sentence need not provisionally recredit a consumer's account in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, nor shall the financial institution be liable under subsection (e) of this section if the written confirmation is not received within the ten-day period referred to in the previous sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Correction of error; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the financial institution determines that an error did occur, it shall promptly, but in no event more than one business day after such determination, correct the error, subject to section 1693g of this title, including the crediting of interest where applicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If a financial institution receives notice of an error in the manner and within the time period specified in subsection (a) of this section, it may, in lieu of the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, within ten business days after receiving such notice provisionally recredit the consumer's account for the amount alleged to be in error, subject to section 1693g of this title, including interest where applicable, pending the conclusion of its investigation and its determination of whether an error has occurred. Such investigation shall be concluded not later than forty-five days after receipt of notice of the error. During the pendency of the investigation, the consumer shall have full use of the funds provisionally recredited.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Absence of error; finding; explanation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the financial institution determines after its investigation pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of this section that an error did not occur, it shall deliver or mail to the consumer an explanation of its findings within 3 business days after the conclusion of its investigation, and upon request of the consumer promptly deliver or mail to the consumer reproductions of all documents which the financial institution relied on to conclude that such error did not occur. The financial institution shall include notice of the right to request reproductions with the explanation of its findings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the financial institution knowingly and willfully concluded that the consumer's account was not in error when such conclusion could not reasonably have been drawn from the evidence available to the financial institution at the time of its investigation,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an unauthorized electronic fund transfer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an incorrect electronic fund transfer from or to the consumer's account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the omission from a periodic statement of an electronic fund transfer affecting the consumer's account which should have been included;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1693g. Consumer liability</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Unauthorized electronic fund transfers; limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer shall be liable for any unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the account of such consumer only if the card or other means of access utilized for such transfer was an accepted card or other meanas&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1693g_1_target" name="1693g_1">1</a></sup> of access and if the issuer of such card, code, or other means of access has provided a means whereby the user of such card, code, or other means of access can be identified as the person authorized to use it, such as by signature, photograph, or fingerprint or by electronic or mechanical confirmation. In no event, however, shall a consumer's liability for an unauthorized transfer exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $50; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of money or value of property or services obtained in such unauthorized electronic fund transfer prior to the time the financial institution is notified of, or otherwise becomes aware of, circumstances which lead to the reasonable belief that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the consumer's account has been or may be effected. Notice under this paragraph is sufficient when such steps have been taken as may be reasonably required in the ordinary course of business to provide the financial institution with the pertinent information, whether or not any particular officer, employee, or agent of the financial institution does in fact receive such information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to <!-- PDFPage:1436 -->report within sixty days of transmittal of the statement (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a reasonable time under the circumstances) any unauthorized electronic fund transfer or account error which appears on the periodic statement provided to the consumer under section 1693d of this title. In addition, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses which the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report any loss or theft of a card or other means of access within two business days after the consumer learns of the loss or theft (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a longer period which is reasonable under the circumstances), but the consumer's liability under this subsection in any such case may not exceed a total of $500, or the amount of unauthorized electronic fund transfers which occur following the close of two business days (or such longer period) after the consumer learns of the loss or theft but prior to notice to the financial institution under this subsection, whichever is less.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action which involves a consumer's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the electronic fund transfer was authorized or, if the electronic fund transfer was unauthorized, then the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to establish that the conditions of liability set forth in subsection (a) of this section have been met, and, if the transfer was initiated after the effective date of section 1693c of this title, that the disclosures required to be made to the consumer under section 1693c(a)(1) and (2) of this title were in fact made in accordance with such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of limitation on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a transaction which involves both an unauthorized electronic fund transfer and an extension of credit as defined in section 1602(e) of this title pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn, the limitation on the consumer's liability for such transaction shall be determined solely in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restriction on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section imposes liability upon a consumer for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer in excess of his liability for such a transfer under other applicable law or under any agreement with the consumer's financial institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Scope of liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in this section, a consumer incurs no liability from an unauthorized electronic fund transfer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financial institution's failure to stop payment of a preauthorized transfer from a consumer's account when instructed to do so in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acts of God and technical malfunctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A financial institution shall not be liable under subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section if the financial institution shows by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control, that it exercised reasonable care to prevent such an occurrence, and that it exercised such diligence as the circumstances required; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a technical malfunction which was known to the consumer at the time he attempted to initiate an electronic fund transfer or, in the case of a preauthorized transfer, at the time such transfer should have occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Intent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a failure described in subsection (a) of this section which was not intentional and which resulted from a bona fide error, notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error, the financial institution shall be liable for actual damages proved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for damaged notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the notice required to be posted pursuant to section 1693b(d)(3)(B)(i) of this title by an automated teller machine operator has been posted by such operator in compliance with such sec<!-- PDFPage:1437 -->tion and the notice is subsequently removed, damaged, or altered by any person other than the operator of the automated teller machine, the operator shall have no liability under this section for failure to comply with section 1693b(d)(3)(B)(i) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1693<em>o</em>&ndash;2. Reasonable fees and rules for payment card transactions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reasonable interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regulatory authority over interchange transaction fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may prescribe regulations, pursuant to section 553 of title 5, regarding any interchange transaction fee that an issuer may receive or charge with respect to an electronic debit transaction, to implement this subsection (including related definitions), and to prevent circumvention or evasion of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reasonable interchange transaction fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of any interchange transaction fee that an issuer may receive or charge with respect to an electronic debit transaction shall be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rulemaking required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall prescribe regulations in final form not later than 9 months after July 21, 2010, to establish standards for assessing whether the amount of any interchange transaction fee described in paragraph (2) is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Information collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may require any issuer (or agent of an issuer) or payment card network to provide the Board with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection and the Board, in issuing rules under subparagraph (A) and on at least a bi-annual basis thereafter, shall disclose such aggregate or summary information concerning the costs incurred, and interchange transaction fees charged or received, by issuers or payment card networks in connection with the authorization, clearance or settlement of electronic debit transactions as the Board considers appropriate and in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Considerations; consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing regulations under paragraph (3)(A), the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider the functional similarity between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) electronic debit transactions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) checking transactions that are required within the Federal Reserve bank system to clear at par;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1447 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) distinguish between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the incremental cost incurred by an issuer for the role of the issuer in the authorization, clearance, or settlement of a particular electronic debit transaction, which cost shall be considered under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) other costs incurred by an issuer which are not specific to a particular electronic debit transaction, which costs shall not be considered under paragraph (2); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consult, as appropriate, with the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration Board, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Adjustments to interchange transaction fees for fraud prevention costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may allow for an adjustment to the fee amount received or charged by an issuer under paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such adjustment is reasonably necessary to make allowance for costs incurred by the issuer in preventing fraud in relation to electronic debit transactions involving that issuer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the issuer complies with the fraud-related standards established by the Board under subparagraph (B), which standards shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) be designed to ensure that any fraud-related adjustment of the issuer is limited to the amount described in clause (i) and takes into account any fraud-related reimbursements (including amounts from charge-backs) received from consumers, merchants, or payment card networks in relation to electronic debit transactions involving the issuer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) require issuers to take effective steps to reduce the occurrence of, and costs from, fraud in relation to electronic debit transactions, including through the development and implementation of cost-effective fraud prevention technology.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rulemaking required</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Board shall prescribe regulations in final form not later than 9 months after July 21, 2010, to establish standards for making adjustments under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In issuing the standards and prescribing regulations under this paragraph, the Board shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the nature, type, and occurrence of fraud in electronic debit transactions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the extent to which the occurrence of fraud depends on whether authorization in an electronic debit transaction is based on signature, PIN, or other means;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the available and economical means by which fraud on electronic debit transactions may be reduced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the fraud prevention and data security costs expended by each party involved in electronic debit transactions (including consumers, persons who accept debit cards as a form of payment, financial institutions, retailers and payment card networks);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) the costs of fraudulent transactions absorbed by each party involved in such transactions (including consumers, persons who accept debit cards as a form of payment, financial institutions, retailers and payment card networks);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) the extent to which interchange transaction fees have in the past reduced or increased incentives for parties involved in electronic debit transactions to reduce fraud on such transactions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VII) such other factors as the Board considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exemption for small issuers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This subsection shall not apply to any issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of less than $10,000,000,000, and the Board shall exempt such issuers from regulations prescribed under paragraph (3)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a debit card or general-use prepaid card that has been provided to a person pursuant to a Federal, State or local government-administered payment program, in which the person may only use the debit card or general-use prepaid card to transfer or debit funds, monetary value, or other assets that have been provided pursuant to such program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a plastic card, payment code, or device that is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to electronic fund transfers, dormancy fees, inactivity charges or fees, service fees, or expiration dates of gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. A State law is not inconsistent with this subchapter if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection afforded by this subchapter. The Board shall, upon its own motion or upon the request of any financial institution, State, or other interested party, submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Board, determine whether a State requirement is inconsistent or affords greater protection. If the Board determines that a State requirement is inconsistent, financial institutions shall incur no liability under the law of that State for a good faith failure to comply with that law, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason. This subchapter does not extend the applicability of any such law to any class of persons or transactions to which it would not otherwise apply.</p>
