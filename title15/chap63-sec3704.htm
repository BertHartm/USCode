<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Matching requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The non-Federal share of the activities (other than planning activities) carried out under an award under this subsection shall be not less than 25 percent of the cost of those activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Criteria for States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish criteria for achievement by each State that participates in the program. Upon the achievement of all such criteria, a State shall cease to be eligible to participate in the program.</p>
