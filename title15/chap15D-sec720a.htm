<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include the criteria for and timing of any open seasons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promote competition in the exploration, development, and production of Alaska natural gas; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in a case in which an expansion is ordered in accordance with section 720c of this title, initial or expansion capacity on any Alaska natural gas transportation project shall be allocated in accordance with procedures to be established by the Commission in regulations issued under paragraph (1).</p>
