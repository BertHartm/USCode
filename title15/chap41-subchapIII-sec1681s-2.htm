<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prohibition</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the information is, in fact, inaccurate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No address requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person who clearly and conspicuously specifies to the consumer an address for notices referred to in subparagraph (B) shall not be subject to subparagraph (A); however, nothing in subparagraph (B) shall require a person to specify such an address.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate&rdquo; means having specific knowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer, that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of the information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duty to correct and update information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more consumer reporting agencies about the person's transactions or experiences with any consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide to the agency any corrections to that information, or any additional information, that is necessary to make the information provided by the person to the agency complete and accurate, and shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any of the information that remains not complete or accurate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Duty to provide notice of dispute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the completeness or accuracy of any information furnished by any person to any consumer reporting agency is disputed to such person by a consumer, the person may not furnish the information to any consumer reporting agency without notice that such information is disputed by the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Duty to provide notice of closed accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a consumer who has a credit account with that person shall notify the agency of the voluntary closure of the account by the consumer, in information regularly furnished for the period in which the account is closed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Duty to provide notice of delinquency of accounts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action shall, not later than 90 days after furnishing the information, notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account, which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph only, and provided that the consumer does not dispute the information, a person that furnishes information on a delinquent account that is placed for collection, charged for profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action, complies with this paragraph, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the person reports the same date of delinquency as that provided by the creditor to which the account was owed at the time at which the commencement of the delinquency occurred, if the creditor previously reported that date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1232 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the creditor did not previously report the date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency, and the person establishes and follows reasonable procedures to obtain the date of delinquency from the creditor or another reliable source and reports that date to a consumer reporting agency as the date of delinquency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the creditor did not previously report the date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency and the date of delinquency cannot be reasonably obtained as provided in clause (ii), the person establishes and follows reasonable procedures to ensure the date reported as the date of delinquency precedes the date on which the account is placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action, and reports such date to the credit reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Duties of furnishers upon notice of identity theft-related information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reasonable procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person that furnishes information to any consumer reporting agency shall have in place reasonable procedures to respond to any notification that it receives from a consumer reporting agency under section 1681c&ndash;2 of this title relating to information resulting from identity theft, to prevent that person from refurnishing such blocked information.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Information alleged to result from identity theft</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a consumer submits an identity theft report to a person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency at the address specified by that person for receiving such reports stating that information maintained by such person that purports to relate to the consumer resulted from identity theft, the person may not furnish such information that purports to relate to the consumer to any consumer reporting agency, unless the person subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Negative information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice to consumer required</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any financial institution that extends credit and regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a(p) of this title furnishes negative information to such an agency regarding credit extended to a customer, the financial institution shall provide a notice of such furnishing of negative information, in writing, to the customer.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Notice effective for subsequent submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">After providing such notice, the financial institution may submit additional negative information to a consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a(p) of this title with respect to the same transaction, extension of credit, account, or customer without providing additional notice to the customer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Time of notice</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The notice required under subparagraph (A) shall be provided to the customer prior to, or no later than 30 days after, furnishing the negative information to a consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a(p) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Coordination with new account disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the notice is provided to the customer prior to furnishing the negative information to a consumer reporting agency, the notice may not be included in the initial disclosures provided under section 1637(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Coordination with other disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The notice required under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may be included on or with any notice of default, any billing statement, or any other materials provided to the customer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) must be clear and conspicuous.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Model disclosure</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Duty of Board to prepare</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Board shall prescribe a brief model disclosure a financial institution may use to comply with subparagraph (A), which shall not exceed 30 words.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Use of model not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a financial institution to use any such model form prescribed by the Board.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Compliance using model</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A financial institution shall be deemed to be in compliance with subparagraph (A) if the financial institution uses any such model form prescribed by the Board, or the financial institution uses any such model form and rearranges its format.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Use of notice without submitting negative information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a financial institution that has provided a customer with a notice described in subparagraph (A) to furnish negative information about the customer to a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Safe harbor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A financial institution shall not be liable for failure to perform the duties required by this paragraph if, at the time of the failure, the financial institution maintained reasonable policies and procedures to comply with this paragraph or the financial institution reasonably believed that the institution is prohibited, by law, from contacting the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1233 --><h4 class="clause-head">(i) Negative information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the impact on the overall accuracy and integrity of consumer reports of any such requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) whether direct contact by the consumer with the furnisher would likely result in the most expeditious resolution of any such dispute; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the potential impact on the credit reporting process if credit repair organizations, as defined in section 1679a(3) of this title, including entities that would be a credit repair organization, but for section 1679a(3)(B)(i) of this title, are able to circumvent the prohibition in subparagraph (G).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) complete such person's investigation of the dispute and report the results of the investigation to the consumer before the expiration of the period under section 1681i(a)(1) of this title within which a consumer reporting agency would be required to complete its action if the consumer had elected to dispute the information under that section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) if the investigation finds that the information reported was inaccurate, promptly notify each consumer reporting agency to which the person furnished the inaccurate information of that determination and provide to the agency any correction to that information that is necessary to make the information provided by the person accurate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Frivolous or irrelevant dispute</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This paragraph shall not apply if the person receiving a notice of a dispute from a consumer reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) by reason of the failure of a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the submission by a consumer of a dispute that is substantially the same as a dispute previously submitted by or for the consumer, either directly to the person or through a consumer reporting agency under subsection (b) of this section, with respect to which the person has already performed the person's duties under this paragraph or subsection (b) of this section, as applicable.</p>
