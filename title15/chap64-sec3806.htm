<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Development of data assessing current state-of-the-art</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than January 1, 1982, the Secretary shall develop data assessing the current state-of-the-art with respect to vehicles fueled by methane to serve as baseline data to be utilized in evaluating improvements in methane-fueled vehicle technologies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines; promulgation, criteria, scope, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than April 1, 1982, the Secretary shall have promulgated necessary and appropriate guidelines for demonstrations and issued an initial request for proposals for technical and financial assistance to support public and private entities in developing and implementing demonstration projects to gather data on the operation of methane-fueled vehicles and methane transmission, storage, and dispensing facilities, under differing climatic, atmospheric, and operating conditions and on design and technical modifications of those vehicles and facilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of public entities, the Secretary is authorized to provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) technical assistance reasonably associated with the modification or acquisition of vehicles to be fueled by methane or with dual fuel capacity, the installation of methane transmission, storage and dispensing facilities, and compliance with data acquisition and reporting requirements under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) grants to cover up to 50 per centum of reasonable and necessary costs associated with the installation of methane transmission, storage and dispensing facilities: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall be authorized to direct and require recipients of assistance under this section to enter into cooperative agreements for the planning and use of such facilities with other recipients of assistance under this section, under a cost-sharing agreement where appropriate and economical.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) In the case of private entities, the Secretary is authorized to provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) technical assistance reasonably associated with the modification or acquisition of vehicles to be fueled by methane or with dual fuel capacity, the installation of methane transmission, storage and dispensing facilities, and compliance with data acquisition and reporting requirements under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) loans to cover up to 50 per centum of reasonable and necessary costs associated with the installation of methane transmission, storage and dispensing facilities: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall be authorized to direct and require recipients of assistance under this section to enter into cooperative agreements for the planning and use of such facilities with other recipients of assistance under this section, under a cost-sharing agreement where appropriate and economical.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Loans issued under this section shall bear interest at such rate as the Secretary may determine, giving consideration to the needs and capacities of the recipient and the prevailing rates of interest (public and private), except that such rate shall not be less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods of maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans. No loan shall be made unless the Secretary shall have determined that there is reasonable prospect of repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The terms and conditions of loans issued under this section shall take into account the scope of the particular demonstration and any particular conditions which might reasonably be expected to result in additional costs to the recipient, and shall reflect the relative costs of gasoline and diesel fuel and methane and the projected savings in fuel costs to the recipient as a result of participating in the demonstration. In no instance shall a loan issued under this section be for a period in excess of five years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary shall provide for appropriate assistance to defray costs associated with complying with data acquisition and reporting requirements under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In the case of an organization comprised of both public and private entities, a package of technical and financial assistance shall be designed to the maximum extent feasible, in such a manner as to assist its public components as provided for in paragraph (1) and to assist its private components as provided for in paragraph (2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Fiscal year limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not fewer than fifty demonstrations shall be assisted under this section with not fewer than ten being initiated in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, and not fewer than twenty being initiated in each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1983, and September 30, 1984. In the case of demonstrations initiated under this chapter after the first fiscal year in which dem<!-- PDFPage:1403 -->onstrations are funded, the Secretary shall ascertain that plans for such demonstrations take into consideration information and findings included in reports filed on other demonstrations assisted under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Duration; recordkeeping requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each demonstration shall have a duration of at least three years during which time records including, but not limited to, fuel efficiency indicators, emissions data, repair statistics, and detailed reports of any accidents, shall be maintained and reports made to the Secretary in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Secretary prior to issuance of the first loan or grant under this section and amended no more often than twice annually.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Selection of proposed demonstrations; discretionary and mandatory criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In selecting proposed demonstrations to be supported under this section, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, assure representation of diverse operating conditions and vehicle types including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) altitude and topography,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) climatic conditions,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) air quality conditions,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) industrial, commercial, and agricultural uses,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block"><em>Provided, however</em>, That not fewer than two demonstrations initiated in each year shall be located in a county or standard metropolitan statistical area designated by the Secretary upon recommendation of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency based on severity or uniqueness of air quality conditions: <em>And provided further</em>, That the fleet or portions of fleets participating in each demonstration with funding under this chapter shall consist of not fewer than fifty vehicles except in the case of one demonstration each year involving methane-fueled off-road agricultural equipment.</p>
