<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Qualifications on issuance of senior securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any registered closed-end company to issue any class of senior security, or to sell any such security of which it is the issuer, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such class of senior security represents an indebtedness&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) immediately after such issuance or sale, it will have an asset coverage of at least 300 per centum;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provision is made to prohibit the declaration of any dividend (except a dividend payable in stock of the issuer), or the declaration of any other distribution, upon any class of the capital stock of such investment company, or the purchase of any such capital stock, unless, in every such case, such class of senior securities has at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution or at the time of any such purchase an asset coverage of at least 300 per centum after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution, or purchase price, as the case may be, except that dividends may be declared upon any preferred stock if such senior security representing indebtedness has an asset coverage of at least 200 per centum at the time of declaration thereof after deducting the amount of such dividend; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provision is made either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that, if on the last business day of each of twelve consecutive calendar months such class of senior securities shall have an asset coverage of less than 100 per centum, the holders of such securities voting as a class shall be entitled to elect at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of such registered company, such voting right to continue until such class of senior security shall have an asset coverage of 110 per centum or more on the last business day of each of three consecutive calendar months, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that, if on the last business day of each of twenty-four consecutive calendar months such class of senior securities shall have an asset coverage of less than 100 per centum, an event of default shall be deemed to have occurred;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such class of senior security is a stock&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) immediately after such issuance or sale it will have an asset coverage of at least 200 per centum;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provision is made to prohibit the declaration of any dividend (except a dividend payable in common stock of the issuer), or the declaration of any other distribution, upon the common stock of such investment company, or the purchase of any such common stock, unless in every such case such class of senior security has at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution or at the time of any such purchase an asset coverage of at least 200 per centum after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provision is made to entitle the holders of such senior securities, voting as a class, to elect at least two directors at all times, and, subject to the prior rights, if any, of the holders of any other class of senior securities outstanding, to elect a majority of the <!-- PDFPage:431 -->directors if at any time dividends on such class of securities shall be unpaid in an amount equal to two full years&rsquo; dividends on such securities, and to continue to be so represented until all dividends in arrears shall have been paid or otherwise provided for;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) provision is made requiring approval by the vote of a majority of such securities, voting as a class, of any plan of reorganization adversely affecting such securities or of any action requiring a vote of security holders as in section 80a&ndash;13(a) of this title provided; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such class of stock shall have complete priority over any other class as to distribution of assets and payment of dividends, which dividends shall be cumulative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Asset coverage in respect of senior securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The asset coverage in respect of a senior security provided for in subsection (a) of this section may be determined on the basis of values calculated as of a time within forty-eight hours (not including Sundays or holidays) next preceding the time of such determination. The time of issue or sale shall, in the case of an offering of such securities to existing stockholders of the issuer, be deemed to be the first date on which such offering is made, and in all other cases shall be deemed to be the time as of which a firm commitment to issue or sell and to take or purchase such securities shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibitions relating to issuance of senior securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section it shall be unlawful for any registered closed-end investment company to issue or sell any senior security representing indebtedness if immediately thereafter such company will have outstanding more than one class of senior security representing indebtedness, or to issue or sell any senior security which is a stock if immediately thereafter such company will have outstanding more than one class of senior security which is a stock, except that (1) any such class of indebtedness or stock may be issued in one or more series: <em>Provided</em>, That no such series shall have a preference or priority over any other series upon the distribution of the assets of such registered closed-end company or in respect of the payment of interest or dividends, and (2) promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued in consideration of any loan, extension, or renewal thereof, made by a bank or other person and privately arranged, and not intended to be publicly distributed, shall not be deemed to be a separate class of senior securities representing indebtedness within the meaning of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Warrants and rights to subscription</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any registered management company to issue any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase a security of which such company is the issuer, except in the form of warrants or rights to subscribe expiring not later than one hundred and twenty days after their issuance and issued exclusively and ratably to a class or classes of such company's security holders; except that any warrant may be issued in exchange for outstanding warrants in connection with a plan of reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application of section to specific senior securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply to any senior securities issued or sold by any registered closed-end company&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for the purpose of refunding through payment, purchase, redemption, retirement, or exchange, any senior security of such registered investment company except that no senior security representing indebtedness shall be so issued or sold for the purpose of refunding any senior security which is a stock; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pursuant to any plan of reorganization (other than for refunding as referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection), provided&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that such senior securities are issued or sold for the purpose of substituting or exchanging such senior securities for outstanding senior securities, and if such senior securities represent indebtedness they are issued or sold for the purpose of substituting or exchanging such senior securities for outstanding senior securities representing indebtedness, of any registered investment company which is a party to such plan of reorganization; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the total amount of such senior securities so issued or sold pursuant to such plan does not exceed the total amount of senior securities of all the companies which are parties to such plan, and the total amount of senior securities representing indebtedness so issued or sold pursuant to such plan does not exceed the total amount of senior securities representing indebtedness of all such companies, or, alternatively, the total amount of such senior securities so issued or sold pursuant to such plan does not have the effect of increasing the ratio of senior securities representing indebtedness to the securities representing stock or the ratio of senior securities representing stock to securities junior thereto when compared with such ratios as they existed before such reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Senior securities securing loans from bank; securities not included in &ldquo;senior security&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be unlawful for any registered open-end company to issue any class of senior security or to sell any senior security of which it is the issuer, except that any such registered company shall be permitted to borrow from any bank: <em>Provided</em>, That immediately after any such borrowing there is an asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of such registered company: <em>And provided further</em>, That in the event that such asset coverage shall at any time fall below 300 per centum such registered company shall, within three days thereafter (not including Sundays and holidays) or such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations, reduce the amount of its borrowings to an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowings shall be at least 300 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) &ldquo;Senior security&rdquo; shall not, in the case of a registered open-end company, include a class or classes or a number of series of preferred or special stock each of which is preferred over all <!-- PDFPage:432 -->other classes or series in respect of assets specifically allocated to that class or series: <em>Provided</em>, That (A) such company has outstanding no class or series of stock which is not so preferred over all other classes or series, or (B) the only other outstanding class of the issuer's stock consists of a common stock upon which no dividend (other than a liquidating dividend) is permitted to be paid and which in the aggregate represents not more than one-half of 1 per centum of the issuer's outstanding voting securities. For the purpose of insuring fair and equitable treatment of the holders of the outstanding voting securities of each class or series of stock of such company, the Commission may by rule, regulation, or order direct that any matter required to be submitted to the holders of the outstanding voting securities of such company shall not be deemed to have been effectively acted upon unless approved by the holders of such percentage (not exceeding a majority) of the outstanding voting securities of each class or series of stock affected by such matter as shall be prescribed in such rule, regulation, or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Senior security&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless otherwise provided: &ldquo;Senior security&rdquo; means any bond, debenture, note, or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness, and any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends; and &ldquo;senior security representing indebtedness&rdquo; means any senior security other than stock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;senior security&rdquo;, when used in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, shall not include any promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness issued in consideration of any loan, extension, or renewal thereof, made by a bank or other person and privately arranged, and not intended to be publicly distributed; nor shall such term, when used in this section, include any such promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness in any case where such a loan is for temporary purposes only and in an amount not exceeding 5 per centum of the value of the total assets of the issuer at the time when the loan is made. A loan shall be presumed to be for temporary purposes if it is repaid within sixty days and is not extended or renewed; otherwise it shall be presumed not to be for temporary purposes. Any such presumption may be rebutted by evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &ldquo;Asset coverage&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;Asset coverage&rdquo; of a class of senior security representing an indebtedness of an issuer means the ratio which the value of the total assets of such issuer, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, bears to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness of such issuer. &ldquo;Asset coverage&rdquo; of a class of senior security of an issuer which is a stock means the ratio which the value of the total assets of such issuer, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, bears to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness of such issuer plus the aggregate of the involuntary liquidation preference of such class of senior security which is a stock. The involuntary liquidation preference of a class of senior security which is a stock shall be deemed to mean the amount to which such class of senior security would be entitled on involuntary liquidation of the issuer in preference to a security junior to it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Future issuance of stock as voting stock; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or as otherwise required by law, every share of stock hereafter issued by a registered management company (except a common-law trust of the character described in section 80a&ndash;16(c) of this title) shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock: <em>Provided</em>, That this subsection shall not apply to shares issued pursuant to the terms of any warrant or subscription right outstanding on March 15, 1940, or any firm contract entered into before March 15, 1940, to purchase such securities from such company nor to shares issued in accordance with any rules, regulations, or orders which the Commission may make permitting such issue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Securities issued by registered face-amount certificate company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter, it shall be unlawful, after August 22, 1940, for any registered face-amount certificate company&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to issue, except in accordance with such rules, regulations, or orders as the Commission may prescribe in the public interest or as necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors, any security other than (A) a face-amount certificate; (B) a common stock having a par value and being without preference as to dividends or distributions and having at least equal voting rights with any outstanding security of such company; or (C) short-term payment or promissory notes or other indebtedness issued in consideration of any loan, extension, or renewal thereof, made by a bank or other person and privately arranged and not intended to be publicly offered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such company has outstanding any security, other than such face-amount certificates, common stock, promissory notes, or other evidence of indebtedness, to make any distribution or declare or pay any dividend on any capital security in contravention of such rules and regulations or orders as the Commission may prescribe in the public interest or as necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to insure the financial integrity of such company, to prevent the impairment of the company's ability to meet its obligations upon its face-amount certificates; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to issue any of its securities except for cash or securities including securities of which such company is the issuer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Application of section to companies operating under Small Business Investment Act provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to investment companies operating under the Small Business Investment Act of <!-- PDFPage:433 -->1958 [15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], and the provisions of paragraph (2) of said subsection shall not apply to such companies so long as such class of senior security shall be held or guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.</p>
