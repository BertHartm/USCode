<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1)(A) At least thousands but possibly millions of information technology computer systems, software programs, and semiconductors are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 or thereafter or will fail to process those dates.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, utilities, government, and safety and defense systems, in the United States and throughout the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) Reprogramming or replacing affected systems before the problem incapacitates essential systems is a matter of national and global interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The prompt, candid, and thorough disclosure and exchange of information related to year 2000 readiness of entities, products, and services&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would greatly enhance the ability of public and private entities to improve their year 2000 readiness; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) is therefore a matter of national importance and a vital factor in minimizing any potential year 2000 related disruption to the Nation's economic well-being and security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Concern about the potential for legal liability associated with the disclosure and exchange of year 2000 readiness information is impeding the disclosure and exchange of such information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The capability to freely disseminate and exchange information relating to year 2000 readiness, solutions, test practices and test results, with the public and other entities without undue concern about litigation is critical to the ability of public and private entities to address year 2000 needs in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal standards in connection with the disclosure and exchange of year 2000 readiness information that will promote disclosures and exchanges of such information in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Based upon the powers contained in article I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, the purposes of this Act are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to promote the free disclosure and exchange of information related to year 2000 readiness;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to assist consumers, small businesses, and local governments in effectively and rapidly responding to year 2000 problems; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by establishing certain uniform legal principles in connection with the disclosure and exchange of information related to year 2000 readiness.</p>
