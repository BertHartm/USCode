<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are increasing numbers of Indian students qualifying for postsecondary education, and there are increasing numbers desiring to go to postsecondary institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the needs of these students far outpace the resources available currently;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Indian tribes have shown an increasing interest in administering programs serving these individuals and making decisions on these programs reflecting their determinations of the tribal and human needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the contracting process under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] has provided a mechanism for the majority of the tribes to assume control over this program from the Bureau of Indian Affairs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) however, inherent limitations in the contracting philosophy and mechanism, coupled with cumbersome administrative procedures developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have effectively limited the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the provision of these services in the most effective and efficient form possible is necessary for tribes, the country, and the individuals to be served; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) these services are part of the Federal Government's continuing trust responsibility to provide education services to American Indian and Alaska Natives.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contracting tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Indian tribe that obtains funds for educational purposes similar to those authorized in this subchapter pursuant to contract under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] may qualify for a grant under this subchapter by submitting to the Secretary a notice of intent to administer a student assistance program under section 3303 of this title. Such notice shall be effective for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it is submitted, except that if such notice is submitted during the last 90 days of a fiscal year such notice shall be effective the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it is submitted, unless the Secretary waives this limitation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Noncontracting tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Indian tribe that is not eligible to qualify for a grant under this subchapter by filing a notice under subsection (a) of this section may qualify for such a grant by filing an application for such a grant. Such application shall be submitted under guidelines for programs under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.], as in effect on January 1, 1991, and shall be reviewed under the standards, practices, and procedures applicable to applications to contract under such Act as in effect on the date the application is received, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the tribe is not notified that its application has been disapproved within 180 days after it is filed with the Secretary, the application shall be deemed to be approved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the application is disapproved, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance to the tribe for purposes of correcting deficiencies in the application;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may be treated as providing services to the tribe or organization if the student provides services for members of the tribe or organization that are approved by the tribe or organization and agreed to by the student even though such services are performed while the student is employed by a Federal, State, or local agency or instrumentality or by a nonprofit or for-profit private institution or organization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may obtain the benefits of a waiver or suspension in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The obligation of a student to perform services under a critical area service agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be suspended for not more than 18 months if, at the request of the student, the tribe or organization determines that there are no employment opportunities available in any critical service area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be suspended if the student ceases to attend an institution of higher education as a consequence of an institutional determination of unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If, at the end of a period of suspension under subparagraph (A), there are still no employ<!-- PDFPage:660 -->ment opportunities available in any critical service area, the student's obligations under the agreement shall terminate. A suspension under subparagraph (B) shall be reviewed by the tribe or organization annually, but may be continued indefinitely.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Pro rata reduction for partial services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, by regulation, provide for the pro rata reduction of repayment obligations under subsection (a)(2) of this section in the case of any student who partially completes the service obligation of that student under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certification of service</h4>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a substantial number of Indian students have partially completed their degrees in postsecondary education, but have been unable, for a number of reasons, to complete the degrees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in at least some measure these students have been supported by tribal funds or grants of Federal monies administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or tribes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the inability of the students to complete these degrees has led to a hardship for the students and a loss of a potential pool of talent to the tribes or tribal organizations which originally financed, at least in part, these efforts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) this loss has crippled tribal efforts in the areas of economic and social development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) this failure to complete the postsecondary schooling has led to economic loss to the tribes and the Federal Government which could be remedied by completion of the courses of study; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a program to identify students with a level of postsecondary completion short of the fulfillment of graduation requirements and to encourage them to complete these requirements, including provision of resources, will benefit the students, the tribes, and the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to establish a revolving loan program to be administered by a tribe or tribal organization for the purposes of increasing the number of college graduates available to work in tribal businesses, tribal government, and tribal services such as schools and hospitals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to conduct research to assess the situational and educational barriers to participation in postsecondary education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to encourage development, through grants, of a model which provides, in addition to loans, transitional and follow-up services needed to encourage persistence in postsecondary education.</p>
