<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Plan requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may make a grant under this chapter on behalf of an Indian tribe for a fiscal year only if&mdash;</p>

The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection and subsection (d) of this section if the recipient has made a good faith effort to fulfill the requirements of this subsection and subsection (d) of this section and agrees to make payments in lieu of taxes to the appropriate taxing authority in an amount consistent with the requirements of subsection (d)(2) of this section until such time as the matter of making such payments has been resolved in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a recipient whose grant beneficiary is more than 1 Indian tribe, the sum of the amounts of the allocations under section 4151 of this title for each such Indian tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use for affordable housing activities under plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section and part B of subchapter II, amounts provided under a grant under this section may be used only for affordable housing activities under subchapter II of this chapter that are consistent with an Indian housing plan approved under section 4113 of this title.</p>
