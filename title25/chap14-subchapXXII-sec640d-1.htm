Each negotiating team shall be composed of not more than five members to be certified by appropriate resolution of the respective tribal council. Each tribal council shall promptly fill any vacancies which may occur on its negotiating team. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each negotiating team, when appointed and certified, shall have full authority to bind its tribe with respect to any other matter concerning the joint use area within the scope of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Failure to select and certify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event either or both of the tribal councils fail to select and certify a negotiating team within thirty days after the Secretary communicates with the tribal council under subsection (a) of this section or to select and certify a replacement member within thirty days of the occurrence of a vacancy, the provisions of section 640d&ndash;3(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#640d-1_1_target" name="640d-1_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall become effective.</p>
