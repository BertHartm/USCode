<p class="statutory-body">(1) One-half of the principal of the settlement fund shall be held in trust by the Secretary for the benefit of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the other half of the settlement fund shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Penobscot Nation. Each portion of the settlement fund shall be administered by the Secretary in accordance with reasonable terms established by the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation, respectively, and agreed to by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may not agree to terms which provide for investment of the settlement fund in a manner not in accordance with section 162a of this title, unless the respective tribe or nation first submits a specific waiver of liability on the part of the United States for any loss which may result from such an investment: <em>Provided, further</em>, That until such terms have been agreed upon, the Secretary shall fix the terms for the administration of the portion of the settlement fund as to which there is no agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under no circumstances shall any part of the principal of the settlement fund be distributed to either the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation, or to any member of either tribe or nation: <em>Provided, however</em>, That nothing herein shall prevent the Secretary from investing the principal of said fund in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall make available to the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation in quarterly payments, without any deductions except as expressly provided in section 1725(d)(2) of this title and without liability to or on the <!-- PDFPage:516 -->part of the United States, any income received from the investment of that portion of the settlement fund allocated to the respective tribe or nation, the use of which shall be free of regulation by the Secretary. The Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation annually shall each expend the income from $1,000,000 of their portion of the settlement fund for the benefit of their respective members who are over the age of sixty. Once payments under this paragraph have been made to the tribe or nation, the United States shall have no further trust responsibility to the tribe or nation or their members with respect to the sums paid, any subsequent distribution of these sums, or any property or services purchased therewith.</p>
