<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are increasing numbers of Indian students qualifying for postsecondary education, and there are increasing numbers desiring to go to postsecondary institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the needs of these students far outpace the resources available currently;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Indian tribes have shown an increasing interest in administering programs serving these individuals and making decisions on these programs reflecting their determinations of the tribal and human needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the contracting process under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] has provided a mechanism for the majority of the tribes to assume control over this program from the Bureau of Indian Affairs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) however, inherent limitations in the contracting philosophy and mechanism, coupled with cumbersome administrative procedures developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have effectively limited the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the provision of these services in the most effective and efficient form possible is necessary for tribes, the country, and the individuals to be served; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) these services are part of the Federal Government's continuing trust responsibility to provide education services to American Indian and Alaska Natives.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Noncontracting tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Indian tribe that is not eligible to qualify for a grant under this subchapter by filing a notice under subsection (a) of this section may qualify for such a grant by filing an application for such a grant.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the application is disapproved, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance to the tribe for purposes of correcting deficiencies in the application;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">An Indian tribe which has qualified under subsection (a) or (b) of this section for a grant under this subchapter for any fiscal year shall continue to be eligible for such a grant for each succeeding fiscal year unless the Secretary revokes such eligibility for a cause described in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Causes for loss of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may revoke the eligibility of an Indian tribe for a grant under this subchapter if such tribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) fails to submit to the Bureau an annual financial statement that reports revenues and expenditures determined by use of an accounting system, established by the tribe, that complies with generally accepted accounting principles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fails to submit to the Bureau an annual program description, stating the number of students served, and containing such information concerning such students, their educational programs and progress, and the financial assistance distributed to such students as the Secretary may require by regulation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) fails, in an evaluation of its financial assistance program conducted by an impartial third party entity, to comply with standards under this subchapter relating to (i) eligible students, programs, or institutions of higher education, (ii) satisfactory progress, or (iii) allowable administrative costs; as determined under contracts applicable to programs to provide financial assistance to individual Indian students for the cost of attendance at institutions of higher education administered by Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] and in effect on January 20, 1991.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Procedures for revocation of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall not revoke the eligibility of an Indian tribe for a grant under this subchapter except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) after notice in writing to the tribe of the cause and opportunity to the tribe to correct;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) providing technical assistance to the tribe in making such corrections; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) costs of administering the program under this subchapter, except that no more may be spent on administration of such program than is generated by the method for administrative cost computation specified in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
