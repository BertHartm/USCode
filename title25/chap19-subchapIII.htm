<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the pendency of such lawsuit also has clouded the easement rights of the South Florida Water Management District in lands necessary for use as a water flowage and storage area, which is part of a federally authorized project for flood control and water management in central and southern Florida, and which is being used to provide and regulate a water supply for the residents of South Florida;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the State of Florida and the Miccosukee Indian Tribe have executed agreements for the purposes of resolving tribal land claims and settling such lawsuit, which agreements require implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States and the Legislature of the State of Florida; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The agreement referred to in paragraph (3) requires the consent of Congress in connection with contemplated land transfers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Settlement Agreement is in the interest of the Miccosukee Tribe, as the Tribe will receive certain monetary payments, new reservation lands to be held in trust by the United States, and other benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Land received by the United States pursuant to the Settlement Agreement is in consideration of Miccosukee Indian Reservation lands lost by the Miccosukee Tribe by virtue of transfer to the Florida Department of Transportation under the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The lands referred to in paragraph (6) as received by the United States will be held in trust by the United States for the use and benefit of the Miccosukee Tribe as Miccosukee Indian Reservation lands in compensation for the consideration given by the Tribe in the Settlement Agreement.</p>
