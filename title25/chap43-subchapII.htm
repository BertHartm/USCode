<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure better access to private mortgage markets for Indian tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency of Indian tribes and their members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to coordinate activities to provide housing for Indian tribes and their members with Federal, State, and local activities to further economic and community development for Indian tribes and their members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to plan for and integrate infrastructure resources for Indian tribes with housing development for tribes; and</p>

The Secretary shall establish limits on the amount of assistance that may be provided under this chapter for activities for families who are not low-income families.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-Indian families</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#4131_1_target" name="4131_1">1</a></sup> Preference for tribal members and other Indian families</h4>

In any case in which the applicable Indian housing plan for an Indian tribe provides for preference under this paragraph, the recipient for the tribe shall ensure that housing activities that are assisted with grant amounts under this chapter for such tribe are subject to such preference.</p>
