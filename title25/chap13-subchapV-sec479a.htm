<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Constitution, as interpreted by Federal case law, invests Congress with plenary authority over Indian Affairs;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the list published by the Secretary should be accurate, regularly updated, and regularly published, since it is used by the various departments and agencies of the United States to determine the eligibility of certain groups to receive services from the United States; and</p>
