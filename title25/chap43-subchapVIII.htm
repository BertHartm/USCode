<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;569, title V, &sect;512, Dec. 27, 2000, 114 Stat. 2966, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States has undertaken a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the United States by&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) employing its resources to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of lower income; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) developing effective partnerships with governmental and private entities to accomplish the objectives referred to in subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States has a special responsibility for the welfare of the Native peoples of the United States, including Native Hawaiians;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.) [former 48 U.S.C. 691 et seq.], the United States set aside 200,000 acres of land in the Federal territory that later became the State of Hawaii in order to establish a homeland for the native people of Hawaii&mdash;Native Hawaiians;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:871 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) despite the intent of Congress in 1920 to address the housing needs of Native Hawaiians through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), Native Hawaiians eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands have been foreclosed from participating in Federal housing assistance programs available to all other eligible families in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) although Federal housing assistance programs have been administered on a racially neutral basis in the State of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians continue to have the greatest unmet need for housing and the highest rates of overcrowding in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) among the Native American population of the United States, Native Hawaiians experience the highest percentage of housing problems in the United States, as the percentage&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) of housing problems in the Native Hawaiian population is 49 percent, as compared to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) 44 percent for American Indian and Alaska Native households in Indian country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) 27 percent for all other households in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) overcrowding in the Native Hawaiian population is 36 percent as compared to 3 percent for all other households in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of Native Hawaiians, as that term is defined in section 801 of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 [25 U.S.C. 4221] (as added by this subtitle), eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands are the most severe, as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the percentage of overcrowding in Native Hawaiian households on the Hawaiian Home Lands is 36 percent; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, which constitute 95 percent of the Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands, are in need of housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) applying the Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) 70.8 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have incomes that fall below the median family income; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) 50 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have incomes below 30 percent of the median family income;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) one-third of those Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands pay more than 30 percent of their income for shelter, and one-half of those Native Hawaiians face overcrowding;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the extraordinarily severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians demonstrate that Native Hawaiians who either reside on, or are eligible to reside on, Hawaiian Home Lands have been denied equal access to Federal low-income housing assistance programs available to other qualified residents of the United States, and that a more effective means of addressing their housing needs must be authorized;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing, and in order to address the continuing prevalence of extraordinarily severe housing needs among Native Hawaiians who either reside or are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands, Congress finds it necessary to extend the Federal low-income housing assistance available to American Indians and Alaska Natives under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) to those Native Hawaiians;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) under the treatymaking power of the United States, Congress had the constitutional authority to confirm a treaty between the United States and the government that represented the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended full diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to the State of Hawaii;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United States have&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal affairs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-governance that has never been extinguished;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) the political relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and reaffirmed by the United States as evidenced by the inclusion of Native Hawaiians in&mdash;</p>
