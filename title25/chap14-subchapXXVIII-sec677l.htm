<p class="statutory-body">After the adoption of a plan for the division of the assets between the two groups, a plan for distribution of the assets of the mixed-blood group to the individual members thereof shall be prepared and ratified by a majority of said group, within the period of six months from such adoption and presented to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary is authorized to provide such reasonable assistance, including necessary technical service of Government employees at Fort Duchesne, Utah, and arranging for necessary consultations with representatives of Federal departments and agencies, officials of the State of Utah and political subdivisions thereof, as may be required by the mixed-blood group in the preparation of such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan for division of the assets among the members of the mixed-blood group may include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Complete disposition of all cash assets of said group, reserving, however, sufficient funds to cover&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the proportionate share of said mixed-blood group in and to all expenses incurred in effecting the purposes of this subchapter, including, but not limited to, the necessary expense incurred under this section and section 677m of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the just and proportionate share of the mixed-bloods in the expense incurred in the prosecution of the claims of the tribe, or the bands thereof, against the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the determinable and estimated administrative costs and expenses of any mixed-blood organization authorized by this subchapter, including lawful and reasonable salaries and fees of authorized agents, officers and employees of said mixed-blood group.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Partition of the lands of the mixed-blood group, excepting all gas, oil, and mineral rights, to corporations, partnerships, or other legal entities, and to trustees, and the individual members of said groups, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to the respective rights and interests of the parties, lo<!-- PDFPage:281 -->cated so as to embrace, as far as practicable, any improvements lawfully made by the person or persons receiving such land. The value of the improvements made, under a valid lease or assignment from the tribe, shall be excluded from the valuation in making allotments to the lessee or assignee, and the land must be valued without regard to such improvements unless the lease or assignment, under which said improvements were made, provided that such improvements should become the property of the tribe. In the making of any partition due consideration shall be given to all of the rights and interests of the person or persons receiving the property, and all of the rights and interests of the other members of the tribe. Two or more of the members of said mixed-blood group may obtain their share of property as tenants in common, as joint tenants, or in any other lawful manner when such members agree among themselves as to the manner in which they desire to receive such title. When it appears that an equitable partition cannot be made among the members of said mixed-blood group without prejudice to the rights and interests of some of them, and yet a partition is directed by the group, the members of said group may voluntarily determine compensation to be made by one party to another on account of the inequity. In all cases where equity is agreed upon by the members of said mixed-blood group, such compensatory adjustment among the parties, according to the principles of equity, must be approved by the Secretary. In the event of a failure to agree upon an equitable compensatory adjustment among the parties the Secretary shall make such adjustment and his decision shall be final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Organization of corporations for the grazing of livestock, handling of water and water rights, and the shares therein may be issued to the members of said group in proportion to their interests in the assets of such corporations. When, in the opinion of said mixed-blood group, it is to the best interest of said group to transfer a portion of the assets of said group to a corporation or other legal entity for any purpose, the Secretary is authorized to make such transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A transfer of assets to one or more trustees designated by said group who shall hold title to all or any part of the property of said group for management or liquidation purposes under terms and conditions prescribed by said mixed-blood group. The Secretary is authorized to make such transfer, and approve the trustees, and the terms and conditions of the trust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Sale of any portion of the assets of said group subject to the approval of the Secretary. In addition to the sales herein otherwise authorized, authority is granted to the authorized representatives of said group to sell any property of said group when, in the opinion of the majority of said mixed-blood group, a practicable partition cannot be made, or for any other reason it is deemed to the best interests of the group, and the proceeds of such sales shall be distributed equitably among the members of said mixed-blood group; after deducting reasonable cost of sale and distribution.</p>
