<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Federal health services to maintain and improve the health of the Indians are consonant with and required by the Federal Government's historical and unique legal relationship with, and resulting responsibility to, the American Indian people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A major national goal of the United States is to provide the resources, processes, and structure that will enable Indian tribes and tribal members to obtain the quantity and quality of health care services and opportunities that will eradicate the health disparities between Indians and the general population of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of health services which will permit the health status of Indians to be raised to the highest possible level and to encourage the maximum <!-- PDFPage:434 -->participation of Indians in the planning and management of those services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Federal health services to Indians have resulted in a reduction in the prevalence and incidence of preventable illnesses among, and unnecessary and premature deaths of, Indians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Despite such services, the unmet health needs of the American Indian people are severe and the health status of the Indians is far below that of the general population of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the provision of safe water supply systems and sanitary sewage and solid waste disposal systems is primarily a health consideration and function;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Indian people suffer an inordinately high incidence of disease, injury, and illness directly attributable to the absence or inadequacy of such systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the long-term cost to the United States of treating and curing such disease, injury, and illness is substantially greater than the short-term cost of providing such systems and other preventive health measures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) many Indian homes and communities still lack safe water supply systems and sanitary sewage and solid waste disposal systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) it is in the interest of the United States, and it is the policy of the United States, that all Indian communities and Indian homes, new and existing, be provided with safe and adequate water supply systems and sanitary sewage waste disposal systems as soon as possible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority; assistance; transfer of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In furtherance of the findings and declarations made in subsection (a) of this section, Congress reaffirms the primary responsibility and authority of the Service to provide the necessary sanitation facilities and services as provided in section 2004a of title 42.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, acting through the Service, is authorized to provide under section 2004a of title 42&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) financial and technical assistance to Indian tribes and communities in the establishment, training, and equipping of utility organizations to operate and maintain Indian sanitation facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ongoing technical assistance and training in the management of utility organizations which operate and maintain sanitation facilities; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:482 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) operation and maintenance assistance for, and emergency repairs to, tribal sanitation facilities when necessary to avoid a health hazard or to protect the Federal investment in sanitation facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Affairs is authorized to transfer funds appropriated under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301, et seq.) to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to accept and use such funds for the purpose of providing sanitation facilities and services for Indians under section 2004a of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) 10-year plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning in fiscal year 1990, the Secretary, acting through the Service, shall develop and begin implementation of a 10-year plan to provide safe water supply and sanitation sewage and solid waste disposal facilities to existing Indian homes and communities and to new and renovated Indian homes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tribal capability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The financial and technical capability of an Indian tribe or community to safely operate and maintain a sanitation facility shall not be a prerequisite to the provision or construction of sanitation facilities by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance to Indian tribes and communities in an amount equal to the Federal share of the costs of operating, managing, and maintaining the facilities provided under the plan described in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;Federal share&rdquo; means 80 percent of the costs described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to Indian tribes with fewer than 1,000 enrolled members, the non-Federal portion of the costs of operating, managing, and maintaining such facilities may be provided, in part, through cash donations or in kind property, fairly evaluated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Eligibility of programs administered by Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Programs administered by Indian tribes or tribal organizations under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination Act [25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.] shall be eligible for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any funds appropriated for the purpose of providing water supply or sewage disposal services,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the level of sanitation deficiency for each sanitation facilities project of each Indian tribe or community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the amount of funds necessary to raise all Indian tribes and communities to a level I sanitation deficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the amount of funds necessary to raise all Indian tribes and communities to zero sanitation deficiency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In preparing each report required under paragraph (1) (other than the initial report), the Secretary shall consult with Indian tribes and tribal organizations (including those tribes or tribal organizations operating health care programs or facilities under any contract entered into with the Service under the Indian Self-Determination Act [25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.]) to determine the sanitation needs of each tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The methodology used by the Secretary in determining sanitation deficiencies for purposes of paragraph (1) shall be applied uniformly to all Indian tribes and communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, the sanitation deficiency levels for an Indian tribe or community are as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) which complies with all applicable water supply and pollution control laws, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in which the deficiencies relate to routine replacement, repair, or maintenance needs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in which the deficiencies relate to capital improvements that are necessary to improve the facilities in order to meet the needs of such tribe or community for domestic sanitation facilities;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) level III is an Indian tribe or community with a sanitation system which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) has no solid waste disposal facility;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) level IV is an Indian tribe or community with a sanitation system which lacks either a safe water supply system or a sewage disposal system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) level V is an Indian tribe or community that lacks a safe water supply and a sewage disposal system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disregard of Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payments in determining appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any payments received by an Indian health program or by an urban Indian organization under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq., 1397aa et seq.] for services provided to Indians eligible for benefits under such respective titles shall not be considered in determining appropriations for the provision of health care and services to Indians.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nonpreferential treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter authorizes the Secretary to provide services to an Indian with coverage under title XVIII, XIX, or XI&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1641_1_target" name="1641_1">1</a></sup> of the Social Security Act in preference to an Indian without such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Special fund</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) 100 percent pass-through of payments due to facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, but subject to paragraph (2), payments <!-- PDFPage:492 -->to which a facility of the Service is entitled by reason of a provision of title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq.] shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the Secretary. In making payments from such fund, the Secretary shall ensure that each Service unit of the Service receives 100 percent of the amount to which the facilities of the Service, for which such Service unit makes collections, are entitled by reason of a provision of either such title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Amounts received by a facility of the Service under subparagraph (A) by reason of a provision of title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act shall first be used (to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts) for the purpose of making any improvements in the programs of the Service operated by or through such facility which may be necessary to achieve or maintain compliance with the applicable conditions and requirements of such respective title. Any amounts so received that are in excess of the amount necessary to achieve or maintain such conditions and requirements shall, subject to consultation with the Indian tribes being served by the Service unit, be used for reducing the health resource deficiencies (as determined in section 1621(c) of this title) of such Indian tribes, including the provision of services pursuant to section 1621d of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Direct payment option</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a tribal health program upon the election of such program under subsection (d) to receive payments directly. No payment may be made out of the special fund described in such paragraph with respect to reimbursement made for services provided by such program during the period of such election.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Direct billing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to complying with the requirements of paragraph (2), a tribal health program may elect to directly bill for, and receive payment for, health care items and services provided by such program for which payment is made under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq., 1397aa et seq.] or from any other third party payor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Direct reimbursement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each tribal health program making the election described in paragraph (1) with respect to a program under a title of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] shall be reimbursed directly by that program for items and services furnished without regard to subsection (c)(1), except that all amounts so reimbursed shall be used by the tribal health program for the purpose of making any improvements in facilities of the tribal health program that may be necessary to achieve or maintain compliance with the conditions and requirements applicable generally to such items and services under the program under such title and to provide additional health care services, improvements in health care facilities and tribal health programs, any health care-related purpose (including coverage for a service or service within a contract health service delivery area or any portion of a contract health service delivery area that would otherwise be provided as a contract health service), or otherwise to achieve the objectives provided in section 1602 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amounts paid to a tribal health program making the election described in paragraph (1) with respect to a program under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act shall be subject to all auditing requirements applicable to the program under such title, as well as all auditing requirements applicable to programs administered by an Indian health program. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the application of auditing requirements applicable to amounts paid under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Identification of source of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any tribal health program that receives reimbursements or payments under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act shall provide to the Service a list of each provider enrollment number (or other identifier) under which such program receives such reimbursements or payments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Examination and implementation of changes</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary, acting through the Service and with the assistance of the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, shall examine on an ongoing basis and implement any administrative changes that may be necessary to facilitate direct billing and reimbursement under the program established under this subsection, including any agreements with States that may be necessary to provide for direct billing under a program under title XIX or XXI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 1397aa et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Coordination of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Service shall provide the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services with copies of the lists submitted to the Service under paragraph (2)(C), enrollment data regarding patients served by the Service (and by tribal health programs, to the extent such data is available to the Service), and such other information as the Administrator may require for purposes of administering title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Withdrawal from program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tribal health program that bills directly under the program established under this sub<!-- PDFPage:493 -->section may withdraw from participation in the same manner and under the same conditions that an Indian tribe or tribal organization may retrocede a contracted program to the Secretary under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.). All cost accounting and billing authority under the program established under this subsection shall be returned to the Secretary upon the Secretary's acceptance of the withdrawal of participation in this program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Termination for failure to comply with requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may terminate the participation of a tribal health program or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1641_2_target" name="1641_2">2</a></sup> in the direct billing program established under this subsection if the Secretary determines that the program has failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (2). The Secretary shall provide a tribal health program with notice of a determination that the program has failed to comply with any such requirement and a reasonable opportunity to correct such noncompliance prior to terminating the program's participation in the direct billing program established under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Related provisions under the Social Security Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For provisions related to subsections (c) and (d), see sections 1880, 1911, and 2107(e)(1)(D) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395qq, 1396j, 1397gg(e)(1)(D)].</p>

In accordance with section 1621t of this title, the absence of the licensure of a health professional employed by such an entity under the State or local law where the entity is located shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the entity meets such standards, if the professional is licensed in another State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application of exclusion from participation in Federal health care programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Excluded entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No entity operated by the Service, an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization that has been excluded from participation in any Federal health care program or for which a license is under suspension or has been revoked by the State where the entity is located shall be eligible to receive payment or reimbursement under any such program for health care services furnished to an Indian.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) the rate of suicide of American Indians and Alaska Natives is 1.9 times higher than the national average rate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the rate of suicide of Indian and Alaska Native youth aged 15 through 24 is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 3.5 times the national average rate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the highest rate of any population group in the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) many risk behaviors and contributing factors for suicide are more prevalent in Indian country than in other areas, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) history of previous suicide attempts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) family history of suicide;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) history of depression or other mental illness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) alcohol or drug abuse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) health disparities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) stressful life events and losses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) easy access to lethal methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) exposure to the suicidal behavior of others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) isolation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) incarceration;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) according to national data for 2005, suicide was the second-leading cause of death for Indians and Alaska Natives of both sexes aged 10 through 34;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) the suicide rates of Indian and Alaska Native males aged 15 through 24 are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) as compared to suicide rates of males of any other racial group, up to 4 times greater; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) as compared to suicide rates of females of any other racial group, up to 11 times greater; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) data demonstrates that, over their lifetimes, females attempt suicide 2 to 3 times more often than males;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) Indian tribes, especially Indian tribes located in the Great Plains, have experienced epidemic levels of suicide, up to 10 times the national average; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A grant may be awarded to an Indian tribe under paragraph (1) only if the Secretary determines that the Indian tribe has the administrative and financial capabilities necessary to conduct a demonstration project described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Health care contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the period in which a demonstration project established under subsection (a) of this section is being conducted by an Indian tribe, the Secretary shall award all health care contracts, including community, behavioral, and preventive health care contracts, to the Indian tribe in the form of a single grant to which the regulations prescribed under part A of title XIX of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 300w et seq.] (as modified as necessary by any agreement entered into between the Secretary and the Indian tribe to achieve the purposes of the demonstration project established under subsection (a) of this section) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of procurement laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may waive such provisions of Federal procurement law as are necessary to enable any Indian tribe to develop and test administrative systems under the demonstration project established under subsection (a) of this section, but only if such waiver does not diminish or endanger the delivery of health care services to Indians.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Termination; evaluation and report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The demonstration project established under subsection (a) of this section shall terminate on September 30, 1993, or, in the case of a demonstration project for which a grant is made after September 30, 1990, three years after the date on which such grant is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) By no later than September 30, 1996, the Secretary shall evaluate the performance of each Indian tribe that has participated in a demonstration project established under subsection (a) of this section and shall submit to the Congress a report on such evaluations and demonstration projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Joint venture demonstration projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, acting through the Service, shall make arrangements with Indian tribes to establish joint venture demonstration projects under which an Indian tribe shall expend tribal, <!-- PDFPage:540 -->private, or other available nontribal funds, for the acquisition or construction of a health facility for a minimum of 20 years, under a no-cost lease, in exchange for agreement by the Service to provide the equipment, supplies, and staffing for the operation and maintenance of such a health facility. A tribe may utilize tribal funds, private sector, or other available resources, including loan guarantees, to fulfill its commitment under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall make such an arrangement with an Indian tribe only if the Secretary first determines that the Indian tribe has the administrative and financial capabilities necessary to complete the timely acquisition or construction of the health facility described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An Indian tribe or tribal organization that has entered into a written agreement with the Secretary under this subsection, and that breaches or terminates without cause such agreement, shall be liable to the United States for the amount that has been paid to the tribe, or paid to a third party on the tribe's behalf, under the agreement. The Secretary has the right to recover tangible property (including supplies), and equipment, less depreciation, and any funds expended for operations and maintenance under this section. The preceding sentence does not apply to any funds expended for the delivery of health care services, or for personnel or staffing, shall be recoverable.<sup><a href="#1680h_1_target" name="1680h_1">1</a></sup></p>
