<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings respecting historical and special legal relationship, and resultant responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, after careful review of the Federal Government's historical and special legal relationship with, and resulting responsibilities to, American Indian people, finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the prolonged Federal domination of Indian service programs has served to retard rather than enhance the progress of Indian people and their communities by depriving Indians of the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of self-government, and has denied to the Indian people an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians which are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Indian people will never surrender their desire to control their relationships both among themselves and with non-Indian governments, organizations, and persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process which will insure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Federal responsibility for and assistance to education of Indian children has not effected the desired level of educational achievement or created the diverse opportunities and personal satisfaction which education can and should provide; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) parental and community control of the educational process is of crucial importance to the Indian people.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Government-to-Government Relations With Native American Tribal Governments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 29, 1994, 59 F.R. 22951, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States Government has a unique legal relationship with Native American tribal governments as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, and court decisions. As executive departments and agencies undertake activities affecting Native American tribal rights or trust resources, such activities should be implemented in a knowledgeable, sensitive manner respectful of tribal sovereignty. Today, as part of an historic meeting, I am outlining principles that executive departments and agencies, including every component bureau and office, are to follow in their interactions with Native American tribal governments. The purpose of these principles is to clarify our responsibility to ensure that the Federal Government operates within a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized Native American tribes. I am strongly committed to building a more effective day-to-day working relationship reflecting respect for the rights of self-government due the sovereign tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to ensure that the rights of sovereign tribal governments are fully respected, executive branch activities shall be guided by the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The head of each executive department and agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the department or agency operates within a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each executive department and agency shall consult, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, with tribal governments prior to taking actions that affect federally recognized tribal governments. All such consultations are to be open and candid so that all interested parties may evaluate for themselves the potential impact of relevant proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Each executive department and agency shall assess the impact of Federal Government plans, projects, programs, and activities on tribal trust resources and assure that tribal government rights and concerns are considered during the development of such plans, projects, programs, and activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Each executive department and agency shall take appropriate steps to remove any procedural impediments to working directly and effectively with tribal governments on activities that affect the trust property and/or governmental rights of the tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Each executive department and agency shall work cooperatively with other Federal departments and agencies to enlist their interest and support in cooperative efforts, where appropriate, to accomplish the goals of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Each executive department and agency shall apply the requirements of Executive Orders Nos. 12875 (&ldquo;Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership&rdquo;) and 12866 (&ldquo;Regulatory Planning and Review&rdquo;) [5 U.S.C. 601 notes] to design solutions and tailor Federal programs, in appropriate circumstances, to address specific or unique needs of tribal communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department and agency shall ensure that the department or agency's bureaus and components are fully aware of this memorandum, through publication or other means, and that they are in compliance with its requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right to administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recognition of obligation of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby recognizes the obligation of the United States to respond to the strong expression of the Indian people for self-determination by assuring maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational as well as other Federal services to Indian communities so as to render such services more responsive to the needs and desires of those communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declaration of commitment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as a whole through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy which will permit an orderly transition from the Federal domination of programs for, and services to, Indians to effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people in the planning, conduct, and administration of those programs and services. In accordance with this policy, the United States is committed to supporting and assisting Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments, capable of administering quality programs and developing the economies of their respective communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Declaration of national goal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Request by tribe; authorized programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is directed, upon the request of any Indian tribe by tribal resolution, to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts with a tribal organization to plan, conduct, and administer programs or portions thereof, including construction programs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provided for in the Act of April 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 596), as amended [25 U.S.C. 452 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which the Secretary is authorized to administer for the benefit of Indians under the Act of November 2, 1921 (42 Stat. 208) [25 U.S.C. 13], and any Act subsequent thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Act of August 5, 1954 (68 Stat. 674), as amended [42 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) administered by the Secretary for the benefit of Indians for which appropriations are made to agencies other than the Department <!-- PDFPage:149 -->of Health and Human Services or the Department of the Interior; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians without regard to the agency or office of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of the Interior within which it is performed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The programs, functions, services, or activities that are contracted under this paragraph shall include administrative functions of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services (whichever is applicable) that support the delivery of services to Indians, including those administrative activities supportive of, but not included as part of, the service delivery programs described in this paragraph that are otherwise contractable. The administrative functions referred to in the preceding sentence shall be contractable without regard to the organizational level within the Department that carries out such functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If so authorized by an Indian tribe under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a tribal organization may submit a proposal for a self-determination contract, or a proposal to amend or renew a self-determination contract, to the Secretary for review. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4), the Secretary shall, within ninety days after receipt of the proposal, approve the proposal and award the contract unless the Secretary provides written notification to the applicant that contains a specific finding that clearly demonstrates that, or that is supported by a controlling legal authority that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the particular program or function to be contracted will not be satisfactory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the program, function, service, or activity (or portion thereof) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities covered under paragraph (1) because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may extend or otherwise alter the 90-day period specified in the second sentence of this subsection,<sup><a href="#450f_1_target" name="450f_1">1</a></sup> if before the expiration of such period, the Secretary obtains the voluntary and express written consent of the tribe or tribal organization to extend or otherwise alter such period. The contractor shall include in the proposal of the contractor the standards under which the tribal organization will operate the contracted program, service, function, or activity, including in the area of construction, provisions regarding the use of licensed and qualified architects, applicable health and safety standards, adherence to applicable Federal, State, local, or tribal building codes and engineering standards. The standards referred to in the preceding sentence shall ensure structural integrity, accountability of funds, adequate competition for subcontracting under tribal or other applicable law, the commencement, performance, and completion of the contract, adherence to project plans and specifications (including any applicable Federal construction guidelines and manuals), the use of proper materials and workmanship, necessary inspection and testing, and changes, modifications, stop work, and termination of the work when warranted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the request of a tribal organization that operates two or more mature self-determination contracts, those contracts may be consolidated into one single contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall approve any severable portion of a contract proposal that does not support a declination finding described in paragraph (2). If the Secretary determines under such paragraph that a contract proposal&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proposes in part to plan, conduct, or administer a program, function, service, or activity that is beyond the scope of programs covered under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) proposes a level of funding that is in excess of the applicable level determined under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">subject to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and the tribal organization agree to, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, approve such portion of the program, function, service, or activity as is authorized under paragraph (1) or approve a level of funding authorized under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title. If a tribal organization elects to carry out a severable portion of a contract proposal pursuant to this paragraph, subsection (b) of this section shall only apply to the portion of the contract that is declined by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedure upon refusal of request to contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary declines to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide assistance to the tribal organization to overcome the stated objections, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide the tribal organization with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the objections raised, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, except that the tribe or tribal organization may, in lieu of filing such appeal, exercise the option to initiate an action in a Federal district court and proceed directly to such court pursuant to section 450m&ndash;1(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability insurance; waiver of defense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Beginning in 1990, the Secretary shall be responsible for obtaining or providing liability insurance or equivalent coverage, on the most cost-effective basis, for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and tribal contractors carrying out <!-- PDFPage:150 -->contracts, grant agreements and cooperative agreements pursuant to this subchapter. In obtaining or providing such coverage, the Secretary shall take into consideration the extent to which liability under such contracts or agreements are covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In obtaining or providing such coverage, the Secretary shall, to the greatest extent practicable, give a preference to coverage underwritten by Indian-owned economic enterprises as defined in section 1452 of this title, except that, for the purposes of this subsection, such enterprises may include non-profit corporations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any policy of insurance obtained or provided by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall contain a provision that the insurance carrier shall waive any right it may have to raise as a defense the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe from suit, but that such waiver shall extend only to claims the amount and nature of which are within the coverage and limits of the policy and shall not authorize or empower such insurance carrier to waive or otherwise limit the tribe's sovereign immunity outside or beyond the coverage or limits of the policy of insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No waiver of the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe pursuant to this paragraph shall include a waiver to the extent of any potential liability for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages or for any other limitation on liability imposed by the law of the State in which the alleged injury occurs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tribal organizations and Indian contractors deemed part of Public Health Service</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where a tribal organization's allowable indirect cost recoveries are below the level of indirect costs that the tribal organizations should have received for any given year pursuant to its approved indirect cost rate, and such shortfall is the result of lack of full indirect cost funding by any Federal, State, or other agency, such shortfall in recoveries shall not form the basis for any theoretical over-recovery or other adverse adjustment to any future years&rsquo; indirect cost rate or amount for such tribal organization, nor shall any agency seek to collect such shortfall from the tribal organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to fund less than the full amount of need for indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liability for indebtedness incurred before fiscal year 1992</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall not be held liable for amounts of indebtedness attributable to theoretical or actual under-recoveries or theoretical over-recoveries of indirect costs, as defined in Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;87, incurred for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 1992.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on remedies relating to cost disallowances</h4>

Such notice shall set forth the right of appeal and hearing to the board of contract appeals pursuant to section 450m&ndash;1 of this title. For the purpose of determining the 365-day period specified in this paragraph, an audit report shall be deemed to have been received on the date of actual receipt by the Secretary, if, within 60 days after receiving the report, the Secretary does not give notice of a determination by the Secretary to reject the single-agency report as insufficient due to noncompliance with chapter 75 of title 31 or noncompliance with any other applicable law. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to enlarge the rights of the Secretary with respect to section 476 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Addition to contract of full amount contractor entitled; adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the approval of a self-determination contract, the Secretary shall add to the contract the full amount of funds to which the contractor is entitled under subsection (a) of this section, subject to adjustments for each subsequent year that such tribe or tribal organization administers a Federal program, function, service, or activity under such contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Indirect costs for contracts for construction programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In calculating the indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract for a construction program, the Secretary shall take into consideration only those costs associated with the administration of the contract and shall not take into consideration those moneys actually passed on by the tribal organization to construction contractors and subcontractors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs budget consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On an annual basis, the Secretary shall consult with, and solicit the participation of, Indian tribes and tribal organizations in the development of the budget for the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (including participation of Indian tribes and tribal organizations in formulating annual budget requests that the Secretary submits to the President for submission to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31).</p>
