L. 93&ndash;638, former] 25 U.S.C. 450f note) was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States and to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding and program management;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) although the Federal Government has made considerable strides in improving Indian health care, it has failed to fully meet its trust responsibilities and to satisfy its obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other laws; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project and finds that transferring full control and funding to tribal governments, upon tribal request, over decision making for Federal programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof)&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) is an appropriate and effective means of implementing the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian tribes; and</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, Indian tribes;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to permit each Indian tribe to choose the extent of its participation in self-governance in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] relating to the provision of Federal services to Indian tribes;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) to ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian tribes and Indian individuals;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) to affirm and enable the United States to fulfill its obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other laws;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) to strengthen the government-to-government relationship between the United States and Indian tribes through direct and meaningful consultation with all tribes;</p>
