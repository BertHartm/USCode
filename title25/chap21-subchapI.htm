<p class="statutory-body">In any State court proceeding for the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child not domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian child's tribe, the court, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, shall transfer such proceeding to the jurisdiction of the tribe, absent objection by either parent, upon the petition of either parent or the Indian custodian or the Indian child's tribe: <em>Provided</em>, That such transfer shall be subject to declination by the tribal court of such tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State court proceedings; intervention</h4>

If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe cannot be determined, such notice shall be given to the Secretary in like manner, who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe. No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the parent or Indian custodian or the tribe shall, upon request, be granted up to twenty additional days to prepare for such proceeding.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Foster care placement orders; evidence; determination of damage to child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely <!-- PDFPage:614 -->to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Parental rights termination orders; evidence; determination of damage to child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the child's extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child's tribe; or (3) other Indian families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foster care or preadoptive placements; criteria; preferences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any child accepted for foster care or preadoptive placement shall be placed in the least restrictive setting which most approximates a family and in which his special needs, if any, may be met. The child shall also be placed within reasonable proximity to his or her home, taking into account any special needs of the child. In any foster care or preadoptive placement, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tribal resolution for different order of preference; personal preference considered; anonymity in application of preferences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a placement under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, if the Indian child's tribe shall establish a different order of preference by resolution, the agency or court effecting the placement shall follow such order so long as the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child, as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Where appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or parent shall be considered: <em>Provided</em>, That where a consenting parent evidences a desire for anonymity, the court or agency shall give weight to such desire in applying the preferences.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition; suitable plan; approval by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Indian tribe which became subject to State jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the Act of August 15, 1953 (67 Stat. 588), as amended by title IV of the Act of April 11, 1968 (82 Stat. 73, 78), or pursuant to any other Federal law, may reassume jurisdiction over child custody proceedings. Before any Indian tribe may reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings, such tribe shall present to the Secretary for approval a petition to reassume such jurisdiction which includes a suitable plan to exercise such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria applicable to consideration by Secretary; partial retrocession</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In considering the petition and feasibility of the plan of a tribe under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may consider, among other things:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) whether or not the tribe maintains a membership roll or alternative provision for clearly identifying the persons who will be affected by the reassumption of jurisdiction by the tribe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the size of the reservation or former reservation area which will be affected by retrocession and reassumption of jurisdiction by the tribe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the population base of the tribe, or distribution of the population in homogeneous communities or geographic areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the feasibility of the plan in cases of multitribal occupation of a single reservation or geographic area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In those cases where the Secretary determines that the jurisdictional provisions of section 1911(a) of this title are not feasible, he is authorized to accept partial retrocession which will enable tribes to exercise referral jurisdiction as provided in section 1911(b) of this title, or, where appropriate, will allow them to exercise exclusive jurisdiction as provided in section 1911(a) of this title over limited community or geographic areas without regard for the reservation status of the area affected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval of petition; publication in Federal Register; notice; reassumption period; correction of causes for disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary approves any petition under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall publish notice of such approval in the Federal Register and shall notify the affected State or States of such approval. The Indian tribe concerned shall reassume jurisdiction sixty days after publication in the Federal Register of notice of approval. If the Secretary disapproves any petition under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide such technical assistance as may be necessary to enable the tribe to correct any deficiency which the Secretary identified as a cause for disapproval.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Pending actions or proceedings unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assumption of jurisdiction under this section shall not affect any action or proceeding over which a court has already assumed jurisdiction, except as may be provided pursuant to any agreement under section 1919 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent the emergency removal of an Indian child who is a resident of or is domiciled on a reservation, but temporarily located off the reservation, from his parent or Indian custodian or the emergency placement of such child in a foster home or institution, under applicable State law, in order to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. The State authority, official, or agency involved shall insure that the emergency removal or placement terminates immediately when such removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child and shall expeditiously initiate a child custody proceeding subject to the provisions of this subchapter, transfer the child to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe, or restore the child to the parent or Indian custodian, as may be appropriate.</p>
