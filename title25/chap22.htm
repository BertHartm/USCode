<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2001. Standards for basic education of Indian children in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of the standards developed under this section shall be to afford Indian students being served by a Bureau funded school with the same opportunities as all other students to achieve the National Education Goals embodied in the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.]. Consistent with the provisions of this section and section 2011 of this title, the Secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to coordinate standards developed and implemented under this section with those in the State improvement plans developed and implemented pursuant to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act for the States in which each Bureau funded school operates. In developing and reviewing such standards and coordination, the Secretary shall utilize the findings and recommendations of the panel established in section 315(b)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2001_1_target" name="2001_1">1</a></sup> of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall take immediate steps to encourage school boards of Bureau funded schools to engage their communities in adopting declarations of purposes of education in their communities, analyzing the implications of such purposes for their schools, and determining how such purposes may be made to motivate students and faculties and otherwise animate their schools by May 1, 1995. Such declarations shall represent the aspirations of a community for the kinds of persons such community wants its children to increasingly become, and shall include such purposes as assuring that all learners are becoming accomplished in ways important to themselves and respected by their parents and communities, shaping worthwhile and satisfying lives for themselves, exemplifying the best values of the community and humankind, and becoming increasingly effective in shaping the character and quality of the world all learners share.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Studies and surveys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 18 months of the publication of the voluntary national content standards described in section 203(a)(2) of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5823(a)(2)], the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and Indian organizations and tribes, shall carry out or cause to be carried out by contract with an Indian organization such studies and surveys, making the fullest use possible of other existing studies, surveys, and plans, as are necessary to establish and revise standards for the basic education of Indian children attending Bureau funded schools. Such studies and surveys shall take into account factors such as academic needs, local cultural differences, type and level of language skills, geographic isolation, and appropriate teacher-student ratios for such children, and shall be directed toward the attainment of equal educational opportunity for such children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Revision of minimum academic standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall revise the minimum academic standards published in the Federal Register of September 9, 1985 (50 Fed. Reg. 174) for the basic education of Indian children in accordance with the purpose described in subsection (a) of this section and the findings of the studies and surveys described in subsection (b) of this section, and shall publish such revised standards in the Federal Register for the purpose of receiving comments from the tribes and other interested parties. Within 21 months of October 20, 1994, the Secretary shall establish final standards, distribute such standards to all the tribes and publish such final standards in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall revise such final standards periodically as necessary. Prior to any revision of such final standards, the Secretary shall distribute such proposed revision to all the tribes, and publish such proposed revision in the Federal Register, for the purpose of receiving comments from the tribes and other interested parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standards described in paragraph (1) shall apply to Bureau schools, and subject to subsection (f) of this section, to contract or grant schools, and may also serve as a model for educational programs for Indian children in public schools. In establishing and revising such standards, the Secretary shall take into account the special needs of Indian students and the support and reinforcement of the specific cultural heritage of each tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternative or modified standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide alternative or modified standards in lieu of the standards established under subsection (c) of this section, where necessary, so that the programs of each school shall be in compliance with the minimum standards required for accreditation of schools in the State where the school is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A tribal governing body, or the local school board so designated by the tribal governing body, shall have the local authority to waive, in part or in whole, the standards established under subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2001_2_target" name="2001_2">2</a></sup> (c) and (d) of this section, where such standards are deemed by such body to be inappropriate. The tribal governing body or designated school board shall, within 60 days thereafter, submit to the Secretary a proposal for alternative standards that take into account the specific needs of the tribe's children. Such revised standards shall be established by the <!-- PDFPage:580 -->Secretary unless specifically rejected by the Secretary for good cause and in writing to the affected tribes or local school board, which rejection shall be final and unreviewable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Implementation of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, through contracting and grant-making procedures, shall assist school boards of contract or grant schools in the implementation of the standards established under subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if the school boards request that such standards, in part or in whole, be implemented. At the request of a contract or grant school board, the Secretary shall provide alternative or modified standards for the standards established under subsections (c) and (d) of this section to take into account the needs of the Indian children and the contract or grant school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 1 year of August 15, 1985, the Bureau shall, either directly or through contract with an Indian organization, establish a consistent system of reporting standards for fiscal control and fund accounting for all contract or grant schools. Such standards shall yield data results comparable to those used by Bureau schools.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Annual plan for meeting of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsections (e) and (f) of this section, the Secretary shall begin to implement the standards established under this section immediately upon the date of their establishment. Not later than January 1, 1995, and at each time thereafter that the annual budget request for Bureau educational services is presented, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a detailed plan to bring all Bureau schools and contract or grant schools up to the level required by the applicable standards established under this section. Such plan shall include detailed information on the status of each school's educational program in relation to the applicable standards established under this section, specific cost estimates for meeting such standards at each school, and specific time lines for bringing each school up to the level required by such standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Closure or consolidation of schools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as specifically required by statute, no school or peripheral dormitory operated by the Bureau on or after January 1, 1992, may be closed or consolidated or have its program substantially curtailed unless done according to the requirements of this subsection, except that, in those cases where the tribal governing body, or the local school board concerned (if so designated by the tribal governing body), requests closure or consolidation, the requirements of this subsection shall not apply. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply when a temporary closure, consolidation, or substantial curtailment is required by plant conditions which constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall, by regulation, promulgate standards and procedures for the closing, consolidation, or substantial curtailment of Bureau schools in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever closure, transfer to any other authority, consolidation, or substantial curtailment of a school is under active consideration or review by any division of the Bureau or the Department of the Interior, the affected tribe, tribal governing body, and designated local school board, will be notified as soon as such consideration or review begins, kept fully and currently informed, and afforded an opportunity to comment with respect to such consideration or review. When a formal decision is made to close, transfer to any other authority, consolidate, or substantially curtail a school, the affected tribe, tribal governing body, and designated local school board shall be notified at least 6 months prior to the end of the school year preceding the proposed closure date. Copies of any such notices and information shall be transmitted promptly to the Congress and published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may terminate, contract, transfer to any other authority, or consolidate or substantially curtail the operation or facilities of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any Bureau funded school that is operated on or after April 1, 1987,</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2007. Allotment formula</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Factors considered; revision to reflect standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish, by regulation adopted in accordance with section 2019&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2007_1_target" name="2007_1">1</a></sup> of this title, a formula for determining the minimum annual amount of funds necessary to sustain each Bureau funded school. In establishing such formula, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the number of eligible Indian students served and size of the school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) special cost factors, such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the isolation of the school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the need for special staffing, transportation, or educational programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) food and housing costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) maintenance and repair costs associated with the physical condition of the educational facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) special transportation and other costs of isolated and small schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) the costs of boarding arrangements, where determined necessary by a tribal governing body or designated local school board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) costs associated with greater lengths of service by educational personnel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(viii) special programs for gifted and talented students;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the cost of providing academic services which are at least equivalent to those provided by public schools in the State in which the school is located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such other relevant factors as the Secretary determines are appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the establishment of the standards required by sections 2001 and 2002 of this title, the Secretary shall revise the formula established under this subsection to reflect the cost and funding standards so established. Prior to January 1, 1996, the Secretary shall review the formula established under this section and shall take such steps as may be necessary to increase the availability of counseling services for students in off-reservation boarding schools and other Bureau operated residential facilities. Concurrent with such action, the Secretary shall review the standards established under section 2001 of this title to be certain that adequate provision is made for parental notification regarding, and consent for, such counseling services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Pro rata allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, Federal funds appropriated for the general local operation of Bureau funded schools shall be allotted pro rata in accordance with the formula established under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Annual adjustment; reservation of amount for training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For fiscal year 1990, and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall adjust the formula established under subsection (a) of this section to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) use a weighted unit of 1.2 for each eligible Indian student enrolled in the seventh and eighth grades of the school in considering the number of eligible Indian students served by the school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consider a school with an enrollment of less than 50 eligible Indian students as having an average daily attendance of 50 eligible Indian students for purposes of implementing the adjustment factor for small schools; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take into account the provision of residential services on a less than 9-month basis at a school when the school board and supervisor of the school determine that a less than 9-month basis will be implemented for the school year involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall reserve for national school board training 0.2 percent of the funds appropriated for each fiscal year for distribution under this section. Such training shall be conducted through the same organizations through which, and in the same manner in which, the training was conducted in fiscal year 1992, except that the contracts for distribution of such funds shall require that such funds be distributed by the recipient organizations in a manner that assures the same pro rata share is made available for training for each school board in the system. If the contract for such training is not awarded before May 1 of each fiscal year, the contract under which such training was provided for the fiscal year preceding such fiscal year shall be renewed by the Secretary for such fiscal year. The agenda for the training sessions shall be established by the school boards through their regional or national organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For each year in which the Secretary uses a weighted unit formula established under subsection (a) of this section to fund Bureau schools, a Bureau school which generates less than 168 weighted units shall receive an additional 2 weighted units to defray school board activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) From the funds allotted in accordance with the formula established under subsection (a) of this section for each Bureau school, the local school board of such school may reserve an amount which does not exceed the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $5,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) $15,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) 1 percent of such allotted funds,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">for school board activities for such school, including and notwithstanding any other provision of law, meeting expenses and the cost of membership in, and support of, organizations engaged in activities on behalf of Indian education.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:588 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall adjust the formula established under subsection (a) of this section to use a weighted unit of 2.0 for each eligible Indian student that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is gifted and talented, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is enrolled in the school on a full-time basis,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">in considering the number of eligible Indian students served by the school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary shall adjust the formula established under subsection (a) of this section to use a weighted unit of 0.25 for each eligible Indian student who is enrolled in a year-long credit course in an Indian or Native language as part of the regular curriculum of a school, in considering the number of eligible Indian students served by such school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The adjustment required under subparagraph (A) shall be used for such school after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the certification of the Indian or Native language curriculum by the school board of such school to the Secretary, together with an estimate of the number of full-time students expected to be enrolled in the curriculum in the second school year following the school year for which the certification is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the funds appropriated for allotment under this section are designated by the appropriations Act appropriating such funds as the amount necessary to implement such adjustment at such school without reducing allotments made under this section to any school by virtue of such adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reservation of amount for emergencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall reserve from the funds available for distribution for each fiscal year under this section an amount which, in the aggregate, shall equal 1 percent of the funds available for such purpose for that fiscal year. Such funds shall be used, at the discretion of the Director of the Office, to meet emergencies and unforeseen contingencies affecting the education programs funded under this section. Funds reserved under this subsection may only be expended for education services or programs at a schoolsite (as defined in section 2503(c)(2) of this title). Funds reserved under this subsection shall remain available without fiscal year limitation until expended. However, the aggregate amount available from all fiscal years may not exceed 1 percent of the current year funds. Whenever the Secretary makes funds available under this subsection, the Secretary shall report such action to the appropriate committees of Congress within the annual budget submission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Supplemental appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Supplemental appropriations enacted to meet increased pay costs attributable to school level personnel shall be distributed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Eligible Indian student&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, the term &ldquo;eligible Indian student&rdquo; means a student who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is a member of or is at least a 1/4 degree Indian blood descendant of a member of an Indian tribe which is eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States through the Bureau to Indians because of their status as Indians, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may permit the attendance at a Bureau school of a student who is not an eligible Indian student if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary determines that the student's attendance will not adversely affect the school's program for eligible Indian students because of cost, overcrowding, or violation of standards,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the school board consents,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the student is a dependent of a Bureau, Indian Health Service, or tribal government, employee who lives on or near the school site, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a tuition is paid for the student that is not more than that charged by the nearest public school district for out-of-district students, is&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2007_2_target" name="2007_2">2</a></sup> in addition to the school's allocation under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2008. Administrative cost grants</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; effect upon appropriated amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, provide grants to each tribe or tribal organization operating a contract school or grant school in the amount determined under this section with respect to the tribe or tribal organization for the purpose of paying the administrative and indirect costs incurred in operating contract or grant schools in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enable tribes and tribal organizations operating such schools, without reducing direct program services to the beneficiaries of the program, to provide all related administrative overhead services and operations necessary to meet the requirements of law and prudent management practice, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) carry out other necessary support functions which would otherwise be provided by the Secretary or other Federal officers or employees, from resources other than direct program funds, in support of comparable Bureau operated programs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts appropriated to fund the grants provided under this section shall be in addition to, and shall not reduce, the amounts appropriated for the program being administered by the contract or grant school.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of amount; reduction for Federal education program payments; reimbursement by Federal departments or agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of the grant provided to each tribe or tribal organization under this section for each fiscal year shall be determined by applying the administrative cost percentage rate of the tribe or tribal organization to the aggregate of the Bureau elementary and secondary functions operated by the tribe or tribal organization for which funds are received from or through the Bureau. The administrative cost percentage rate determined under subsection (c) of this section does not apply to other programs operated by the tribe or tribal organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce the amount of the grant determined under paragraph (1) to the extent that payments for administrative costs are actually received by an Indian tribe or tribal organization under any Federal education program included in the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) take such actions as may be necessary to be reimbursed by any other department or agency of the Federal Government for the portion of grants made under this section for the costs of administering any program for Indians that is funded by appropriations made to such other department or agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative cost percentage rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, the administrative cost percentage rate for a contract or grant school for a fiscal year is equal to the percentage determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the minimum base rate, plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the standard direct cost base, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the maximum base rate, by</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the standard direct cost base.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The administrative cost percentage rate shall be determined to the 1/100 of a decimal point.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administrative cost account; availability of funds; effect upon indirect cost recovery determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Funds received by a tribe or contract or grant school as grants under this section for tribal elementary or secondary educational programs may be combined by the tribe or contract or grant school into a single administrative cost account without the necessity of maintaining separate funding source accounting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Indirect cost funds for programs at the school which share common administrative services with tribal elementary or secondary educational programs may be included in the administrative cost account described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds received as grants under this section with respect to tribal elementary or secondary education programs shall remain available to the contract or grant school without fiscal year limitation and without diminishing the amount of any grants otherwise payable to the school under this section for any fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year for which the grant is provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Funds received as grants under this section for Bureau funded programs operated by a tribe or tribal organization under a contract or agreement shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of indirect cost underrecovery and overrecovery determinations by any Federal agency for any other funds, from whatever source derived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In applying this section and section 105 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450j] with respect to an Indian tribe or tribal organization that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) receives funds under this section for administrative costs incurred in operating a contract or grant school or a school operated under the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 [25 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.], and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) operates 1 or more other programs under a contract or grant provided under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.],</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Studies for determination of factors affecting costs, minimum and maximum base rates, and standard direct cost base; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon April 28, 1988, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conduct such studies as may be needed to establish an empirical basis for determining relevant factors substantially affecting the required administrative costs of tribal elementary and secondary educational programs, using the formula set forth in subsection (c) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) conduct a study to determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a maximum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the smallest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a minimum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the largest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) a standard direct cost base which is the aggregate direct cost funding level for which the percentage determined under subsection (c) of this section will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) be equal to the median between the maximum base rate and the minimum base rate, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) ensure that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of tribal elementary or secondary educational programs closest to the size of the program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:591 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The studies required under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be conducted in full consultation (in accordance with section 2011 of this title) with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the tribes and tribal organizations that are affected by the application of the formula set forth in subsection (c) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) all national and regional Indian organizations of which such tribes and tribal organizations are typically members;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be conducted onsite with a representative statistical sample of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs under a contract entered into with a nationally reputable public accounting and business consulting firm;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take into account the availability of skilled labor, commodities, business and automatic data processing services, related Indian preference and Indian control of education requirements, and any other market factors found substantially to affect the administrative costs and efficiency of each such tribal elementary or secondary educational program studied in order to assure that all required administrative activities can reasonably be delivered in a cost effective manner for each such program, given an administrative cost allowance generated by the values, percentages, or other factors found in the studies to be relevant in such formula;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) identify, and quantify in terms of percentages of direct program costs, any general factors arising from geographic isolation, or numbers of programs administered, independent of program size factors used to compute a base administrative cost percentage in such formula; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) identify any other incremental cost factors substantially affecting the costs of required administrative cost functions at any of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs studied and determine whether the factors are of general applicability to other such programs, and (if so) how the factors may effectively be incorporated into such formula.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In carrying out the studies required under this subsection, the Secretary shall obtain the input of, and afford an opportunity to participate to, the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the transaction is documented in a journal maintained at the school clearly identifying when the transaction occurred, what was acquired and from whom, the prices paid, the quantities acquired, and any other information the supervisor or school board considers relevant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Director shall be responsible for determining the application of this paragraph, including the authorization of specific individuals to carry out this paragraph, and shall be responsible for the provision of guidelines on the use of this paragraph and adequate training on such guidelines.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Local financial plans for expenditure of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of all Bureau schools, allotted funds shall be expended on the basis of local financial plans which shall be prepared by the local school supervisor in active consultation with the local school board for each school, and the local school board for each school shall have the authority to ratify, reject, or amend such financial plan, and expenditures thereunder, and, on its own determination or in response to the supervisor of the school, to revise such financial plan to meet needs not foreseen at the time of preparation of the financial plan. The supervisor shall provide the appropriate union representative of the education employees with copies of proposed draft financial plans and all amendments or modifications thereto, at the same time such copies are submitted to the local school board. The supervisor of the school may appeal any such action of the local school board to the appropriate education line officer of the Bureau agency by filing a written statement describing the action and the reasons the supervisor believes such action should be overturned. A copy of such statement shall be submitted to the local school board and such board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, in writing, to such appeal. After reviewing such written appeal and response, the appropriate education line officer may, for good cause, overturn the action of the local school board. The appropriate line education officer shall transmit the determination of such appeal in the form of a written opinion to such board and to such supervisor identifying the reasons for overturning such action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of self-determination grant funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds for self-determination grants under section 450h(a)(2) of this title shall not be used for providing technical assistance and training in the field of education by the Bureau unless such services are provided in accordance with a plan, agreed to by the tribe or tribes affected and the Bureau, under which control of education programs is intended to be transferred to such tribe or tribes within a specific period of time negotiated under such agreement. The Secretary may approve applications for funding tribal divisions of education and the development of tribal codes of education from funds appropriated pursuant to section 450h(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2010_1_target" name="2010_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Summer program of academic and support services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A financial plan under subsection (b) of this section for a school may include, at the discre<!-- PDFPage:594 -->tion of the local administrator and the school board of such school, a provision for a summer program of academic and support services for students of the school. Any such program may include activities related to the prevention of alcohol and substance abuse. The Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs shall provide for the utilization of any such school facility during any summer in which such utilization is requested.</p>
