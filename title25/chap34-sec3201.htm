<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, after careful review of the problem of child abuse on Indian reservations and the historical and special relationship of the Federal Government with Indian people,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) incidents of abuse of children on Indian reservations are grossly underreported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such underreporting is often a result of the lack of a mandatory Federal reporting law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) multiple incidents of sexual abuse of children on Indian reservations have been perpetrated by persons employed or funded by the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Federal Government investigations of the background of Federal employees who care for, or teach, Indian children are often deficient;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) funds spent by the United States on Indian reservations or otherwise spent for the benefit of Indians who are victims of child <!-- PDFPage:671 -->abuse or family violence are inadequate to meet the growing needs for mental health treatment and counseling for victims of child abuse or family violence and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of, or are eligible for membership in, an Indian tribe; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) declares that two major goals of the United States are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify the scope of incidents of abuse of children and family violence in Indian country and to reduce such incidents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide funds for mental health treatment for Indian victims of child abuse and family violence on Indian reservations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require that reports of abused Indian children are made to the appropriate authorities in an effort to prevent further abuse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish a reliable data base for statistical purposes and to authorize a study to determine the need for a central registry for reported incidents of abuse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authorize such other actions as are necessary to ensure effective child protection in Indian country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establish the Indian Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Grant Program to provide funds for the establishment on Indian reservations of treatment programs for victims of child sexual abuse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide for technical assistance and training related to the investigation and treatment of cases of child abuse and neglect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) establish Indian Child Resource and Family Services Centers in each Bureau of Indian Affairs Area Office which will consist of multi-disciplinary teams of personnel with experience and training in the prevention, identification, investigation, and treatment of child abuse and neglect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the treatment and prevention of incidents of family violence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) establish tribally operated programs to protect Indian children and reduce the incidents of family violence in Indian country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) authorize other actions necessary to ensure effective child protection on Indian reservations.</p>
