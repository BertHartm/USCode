<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes the obligation of the United States to respond to the strong expression of the Indian people for self-determination by assuring maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational services so as to render such services more responsive to the needs and desires of those communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commitment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing trust relationship with and responsibility to the Indian people through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy for education which will deter further perpetuation of Federal bureaucratic domination of programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) National goal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a major national goal of the United States is to provide the resources, processes, and structures which will enable tribes and local communities to effect the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Educational needs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress affirms the reality of the special and unique educational needs of Indian peoples, including the need for programs to meet the linguistic and cultural aspirations of Indian tribes and communities. These may best be met through a grant process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal relations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares its commitment to these policies and its support, to the full extent of its responsibility, for Federal relations with the Indian Nations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby repudiates and rejects House Concurrent Resolution 108 of the 83rd Congress and any policy of unilateral termination of Federal relations with any Indian Nation.</p>
