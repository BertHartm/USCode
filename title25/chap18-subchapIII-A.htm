<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;417, &sect;2, Nov. 1, 2000, 114 Stat. 1812, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In 1988, Congress enacted section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1645) that established a demonstration program to authorize 4 tribally-operated Indian Health Service hospitals or clinics to test methods for direct billing and receipt of payment for health services provided to patients eligible for reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.), and other third party payors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The 4 participants selected by the Indian Health Service for the demonstration program began the direct billing and collection program in fiscal year 1989 and unanimously expressed success and satisfaction with the program. Benefits of the program include dramatically increased collections for services provided under the medicare and medicaid programs, a significant reduction in the turn-around time between billing and receipt of payments for services provided to eligible patients, and increased efficiency of participants being able to track their own billings and collections.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The success of the demonstration program confirms that the direct involvement of tribes and tribal organizations in the direct billing of, and collection of payments from, the medicare and medicaid programs, and other third party payor reimbursements, is more beneficial to Indian tribes than the current system of Indian Health Service-managed collections.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Allowing tribes and tribal organizations to directly manage their medicare and medicaid billings and collections, rather than channeling all activities through the Indian Health Service, will enable the Indian Health Service to reduce its administrative costs, is consistent with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination Act [25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.], and furthers the commitment of the Secretary to enable tribes and tribal organizations to manage and operate their health care programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The demonstration program was originally to expire on September 30, 1996, but was extended by Congress, so that the current participants would not experience an interruption in the program while Congress awaited a recommendation from the Secretary of Health and Human Services on whether to make the program permanent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) It would be beneficial to the Indian Health Service and to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native organizations to provide permanent status to the demonstration program and to extend participation in the program to other Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations who operate a facility of the Indian Health Service.&rdquo;</p>
