<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to encourage the resolution of disputes over historical claims through mutually agreed-to settlements between Indian Nations and the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There are pending before the United States Court of Federal Claims certain lawsuits against the United States brought by the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations seeking monetary damages for the alleged use and mismanagement of tribal resources along the Arkansas River in eastern Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Cherokee Nation, a federally recognized Indian tribe with its present tribal headquarters south of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, having adopted its most recent constitution on June 26, 1976, and having entered into various treaties with the United States, including but not limited to the Treaty at Hopewell, executed on November 28, 1785 (7 Stat. 18), and the Treaty at Washington, D.C., executed on July 19, 1866 (14 Stat. 799), has maintained a continuous government-to-government relationship with the United States since the earliest years of the Union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Choctaw Nation, a federally recognized Indian tribe with its present tribal headquarters in Durant, Oklahoma, having adopted its most recent constitution on July 9, 1983, and having entered into various treaties with the United States of America, including but not limited to the Treaty at Hopewell, executed on January 3, 1786 (7 Stat. 21), and the Treaty at Washington, D.C., executed on April 28, 1866 (7 Stat. 21),<sup><a href="#1779_1_target" name="1779_1">1</a></sup> has maintained a continuous government-to-government relationship with the United States since the earliest years of the Union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Chickasaw Nation, a federally recognized Indian tribe with its present tribal headquarters in Ada, Oklahoma, having adopted its most recent constitution on August 27, 1983, and having entered into various treaties with the United States of America, including but not limited to the Treaty at Hopewell, executed on January 10, 1786 (7 Stat. 24), and the Treaty at Washington, D.C., executed on April 28, 1866 (7 Stat. 21),<sup><a href="#1779_1_target" name="1779_1">1</a></sup> has maintained a continuous government-to-government relationship with the United States since the earliest years of the Union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In the first half of the 19th century, the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations were forcibly removed from their homelands in the southeastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi in the Indian Territory that were ceded to them by the United States. From the &ldquo;Three Forks&rdquo; area near present day Muskogee, Oklahoma, downstream to the point of confluence with the Canadian River, the Arkansas River flowed entirely within the territory of the Cherokee Nation. From that point of confluence downstream to the Arkansas territorial line, the Arkansas River formed the boundary between the Cherokee Nation on the left side of the thread of the river and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations on the right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Pursuant to the Act of April 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 137),<sup><a href="#1779_2_target" name="1779_2">2</a></sup> tribal property not allotted to individuals or otherwise disposed of, including the bed and banks of the Arkansas River, passed to the United States in trust for the use and benefit of the respective Indian Nations in accordance with their respective interests therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) For more than 60 years after Oklahoma statehood, the Bureau of Indian Affairs believed that Oklahoma owned the Riverbed <!-- PDFPage:578 -->from the Arkansas State line to Three Forks, and therefore took no action to protect the Indian Nations&rsquo; Riverbed resources such as oil, gas, and Drybed Lands suitable for grazing and agriculture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Third parties with property near the Arkansas River began to occupy the Indian Nations&rsquo; Drybed Lands&mdash;lands that were under water at the time of statehood but that are now dry due to changes in the course of the river.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) In 1966, the Indian Nations sued the State of Oklahoma to recover their lands. In 1970, the Supreme Court of the United States decided in the case of Choctaw Nation vs. Oklahoma (396 U.S. 620),<sup><a href="#1779_3_target" name="1779_3">3</a></sup> that the Indian Nations retained title to their respective portions of the Riverbed along the navigable reach of the river.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) In 1987, the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of United States vs. Cherokee Nation (480 U.S. 700) decided that the riverbed lands did not gain an exemption from the Federal Government's navigational servitude and that the Cherokee Nation had no right to compensation for damage to its interest by exercise of the Government's servitude.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) In 1989, the Indian Nations filed lawsuits against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims (Case Nos. 218&ndash;89L and 630&ndash;89L), seeking damages for the United States&rsquo; use and mismanagement of tribal trust resources along the Arkansas River. Those actions are still pending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) In 1997, the United States filed quiet title litigation against individuals occupying some of the Indian Nations&rsquo; Drybed Lands. That action, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, was dismissed without prejudice on technical grounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Much of the Indian Nations&rsquo; Drybed Lands have been occupied by a large number of adjacent landowners in Oklahoma. Without Federal legislation, further litigation against thousands of such landowners would be likely and any final resolution of disputes would take many years and entail great expense to the United States, the Indian Nations, and the individuals and entities occupying the Drybed Lands and would seriously impair long-term economic planning and development for all parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The Councils of the Cherokee and Choctaw Nations and the Legislature of the Chickasaw Nation have each enacted tribal resolutions which would, contingent upon the passage of this subchapter and the satisfaction of its terms and in exchange for the moneys appropriated hereunder&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) settle and forever release their respective claims against the United States asserted by them in United States Court of Federal Claims Case Nos. 218&ndash;89L and 630&ndash;89L; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) forever disclaim any and all right, title, and interest in and to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, as set forth in those enactments of the respective councils of the Indian Nations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) The resolutions adopted by the respective Councils of the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations each provide that, contingent upon the passage of the settlement legislation and satisfaction of its terms, each Indian Nation agrees to dismiss, release, and forever discharge its claims asserted against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims, Case Nos. 218&ndash;89L and 630&ndash;89L, and to forever disclaim any right, title, or interest of the Indian Nation in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, in exchange for the funds appropriated and allocated to the Indian Nation under the provisions of the settlement legislation, which funds the Indian Nation agrees to accept in full satisfaction and settlement of all claims against the United States for the damages sought in the aforementioned claims asserted in the United States Court of Federal Claims, and as full and fair compensation for disclaiming its right, title, and interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) In those resolutions, each Indian Nation expressly reserved all of its beneficial interest and title to all other Riverbed lands, including minerals, as determined by the Supreme Court in Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U.S. 620 (1970), and further reserved any and all right, title, or interest that each Nation may have in and to the water flowing in the Arkansas River and its tributaries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Extinguishment of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to their respective tribal resolutions, and in exchange for the benefits conferred under this subchapter, the Indian Nations shall, on December 13, 2002, enter into a consent decree with the United States that waives, releases, and dismisses all the claims they have asserted or could have asserted in their cases numbered 218&ndash;89L and 630&ndash;89L pending in the United States Court of Federal Claims against the United States, including but not limited to claims arising out of any and all of the Indian Nations&rsquo; interests in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands and arising out of construction, maintenance and operation of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation Way. The Indian Nations and the United States shall lodge the consent decree with the Court of Federal Claims within 30 days of December 13, 2002, and shall move for entry of the consent decree at such time as all appropriations by Congress pursuant to the authority of this subchapter have been made and deposited into the appropriate tribal trust fund account of the Indian Nations as described in section 1779d of this title. Upon entry of the consent decree, all the Indian Nations&rsquo; claims and all their past, present, and future right, title, and interest to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, shall be deemed extinguished. No claims may be asserted in the future against the United States pursuant to sections 1491, 1346(a)(2), or 1505 of title 28 for actions taken or failed to have been taken by the United States for events occurring prior to the date of the extinguishment of claims with respect to the Riverbed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Release of tribal claims to certain Drybed Lands</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the deposit of all funds authorized for appropriation under subsection (c) of this section for an Indian Nation into the appropriate trust fund account described in section 1779d of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all claims now existing or which may arise in the future with respect to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands and all right, title, and interest that the Indian Nations and the United States as trustee on behalf of the Indian Nation may have to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, shall be deemed extinguished;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any interest of the Indian Nations or the United States as trustee on their behalf in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands shall further be extinguished pursuant to the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, Act of July 22, 1790 (ch. 33, 1 Stat. 137), and all subsequent amendments thereto (as codified at 25 U.S.C. 177);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to the extent parties other than the Indian Nations have transferred interests in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands in violation of the Trade and Intercourse Act, Congress does hereby approve and ratify such transfers of interests in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands to the extent that such transfers otherwise are valid under law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Secretary is authorized to execute an appropriate document citing this subchapter, suitable for filing with the county clerks, or such other county official as appropriate, of those counties wherein the foregoing described lands are located, disclaiming any tribal or Federal interest on behalf of the Indian Nations in such Disclaimed Drybed Lands. The Secretary is authorized to file with the counties a plat or map of the disclaimed lands should the Secretary determine that such filing will clarify the extent of lands disclaimed. Such a plat or map may be filed regardless of whether the map or plat has been previously approved for filing, whether or not the map or plat has been filed, and regardless of whether the map or plat constitutes a final determination by the Secretary of the extent of the Indian Nations&rsquo; original claim to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands. The disclaimer filed by the United States shall constitute a disclaimer of the Disclaimed Drybed Lands for purposes of the Trade and Intercourse Act (25 U.S.C. 177).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Indian Nations do not relinquish any right, title, or interest in any lands <!-- PDFPage:580 -->which constitute the Wetbed Lands subject to the navigational servitude exercised by the United States on the Wetbed Lands. By virtue of the exercise of the navigational servitude, the United States shall not be liable to the Indian Nations for any loss they may have related to the minerals in the Wetbed Lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no provision of this subchapter shall be construed to extinguish or convey any water rights of the Indian Nations in the Arkansas River or any other stream or the beneficial interests or title of any of the Indian Nations in and to lands held in trust by the United States on December 13, 2002, which lie above or below the mean high water mark of the Arkansas River, except for the Disclaimed Drybed Lands; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Indian Nations do not relinquish any right, title, or interest in any lands or minerals of certain unallotted tracts which are identified in the official records of the Eastern Oklahoma Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the event the Court of Federal Claims does not enter the consent decree as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be entitled to setoff against any claims of the Indian Nations as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, any funds transferred to the Indian Nations pursuant to section 1779d of this title, and any interest accrued thereon up to the date of setoff.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Quiet title actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the United States nor any department of the United States nor the Indian Nations shall be made parties to any quiet title lawsuit or other lawsuit to determine ownership of or an interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands initiated by any private person or private entity after execution of the disclaimer set out in subsection (b)(1) of this section. The United States will have no obligation to undertake any future quiet title actions or actions for the recovery of lands or funds relating to any Drybed Lands retained by the Indian Nation or Indian Nations under this subchapter, including any lands which are Wetbed Lands on December 13, 2002, but which subsequently lie above the mean high water mark of the Arkansas River and the failure or declination to initiate any quiet title action or to manage any such Drybed Lands shall not constitute a breach of trust by the United States or be compensable to the Indian Nation or Indian Nations in any manner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Land to be conveyed in fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the United States determines that it is able to effectively maintain the McClellan-Kerr Navigation Way without retaining title to lands above the high water mark of the Arkansas River as of December 13, 2002, said lands, after being declared surplus, shall be conveyed in fee to the Indian Nation within whose boundary the land is located. The United States shall not be obligated to accept such property in trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization for settlement appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated an aggregate sum of $40,000,000 as follows:</p>
