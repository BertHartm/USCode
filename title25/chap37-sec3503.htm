Such program shall include, but not be limited to, the following components:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall provide development grants to Indian tribes or to joint ventures which are 51 percent or more controlled by an Indian tribe to assist Indian tribes in obtaining the managerial and technical capability needed to develop the energy resources on Indian reservations. Such grants shall include provisions for management training for tribal or village members, improving the technical capacity of the Indian tribe, and the reduction of tribal unemployment. Each grant shall be for a period of 3 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary shall provide grants, not to exceed 50 percent of the project costs, for vertical integration projects. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;vertical integration project&rdquo; means a project that promotes the vertical integration of the energy resources on an Indian reservation, so that the energy resources are used or processed on such Indian reservation. Such term includes, but is not limited to, projects involving solar and wind energy, oil refineries, the generation and transmission of electricity, hydroelectricity, cogeneration, natural gas distribution, and clean, innovative uses of coal.</p>
