<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4101. Congressional findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the Nation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by using Federal resources to aid families and individuals seeking affordable homes in safe and healthy environments and, in particular, assisting responsible, deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal Government, State, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Constitution of the United States invests the Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the United States in helping tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan villages is acute and the Federal Government should work not only to provide housing assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in the development of private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for tribes and their members; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities should be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in Public Law 93&ndash;638 (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-Indian families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a recipient may provide housing or housing assistance provided through affordable housing activities assisted with grant amounts under this chapter for a non-Indian family on an Indian reservation or other Indian area if the recipient determines that the presence of the family on the Indian reservation or other Indian area is essential to the well-being of Indian families and the need for housing for the family cannot reasonably be met without such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Law enforcement officers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, by regulations issued not later than the expiration of the 12-month period beginning on October 26, 1996, in the manner provided under section 4116 of this title, establish a formula to provide for allocating amounts available for a fiscal year for block grants under this chapter among Indian tribes in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors for determination of need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The formula shall be based on factors that reflect the need of the Indian tribes and the Indian areas of the tribes for assistance for affordable housing activities, including the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The number of low-income housing dwelling units owned or operated at the time pursuant to a contract between an Indian housing authority for the tribe and the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The extent of poverty and economic distress and the number of Indian families within Indian areas of the tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Other objectively measurable conditions as the Secretary and the Indian tribes may specify.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Other factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing the formula, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the relative administrative capacities and other challenges faced by the recipient, including, but not limited to geographic distribution within the Indian area and technical capacity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which terminations of assistance under subchapter V of this chapter will affect funding available to State recognized tribes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funding for public housing operation and modernization</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Full funding</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except with respect to an Indian tribe described in subparagraph (B), the formula shall provide that, if, in any fiscal year, the total amount made available for assistance under this chapter is equal to or greater than the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of public housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], the amount provided for such fiscal year for each Indian tribe for which such operating or modernization assistance was provided for fiscal year 1996 shall not be less than the total amount of such operating and modernization assistance provided for fiscal year 1996 for such tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to fiscal year 2001 and each fiscal year thereafter, for any Indian tribe with an Indian housing authority that owns or operates fewer than 250 public housing units, the formula shall provide that if the amount provided for a fiscal year in which the total amount made available for assistance under this chapter is equal to or greater than the amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of the public housing referred to in subparagraph (A), then the amount provided to that Indian tribe as modernization assistance shall be equal to the average annual amount of funds provided to the Indian tribe (other than funds provided as emergency assistance) under the assistance program under section 14 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437<em>l</em>) for the period beginning with fiscal year 1992 and ending with fiscal year 1997.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Partial funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The formula shall provide that, if, in any fiscal year, the total amount made available for <!-- PDFPage:804 -->assistance under this chapter is less than the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of public housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], the amount provided for such fiscal year for each Indian tribe for which such operating or modernization assistance was provided for fiscal year 1996 shall not be less than the amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount available for assistance under this chapter for such fiscal year that the amount of operating and modernization assistance provided for the tribe for fiscal year 1996 bears to the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of such public housing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary takes an action under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall continue such action until the Secretary determines that the failure to comply has ceased.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception for certain actions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, if the Secretary makes a determination that the failure of a recipient of assistance under this chapter to comply substantially with any material provision (as that term is defined by the Secretary) of this chapter is resulting, and would continue to result, in a continuing expenditure of Federal funds in a manner that is not authorized by law, the Secretary may take an action described in paragraph (1)(C) before conducting a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Procedural requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary takes an action described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary makes a finding under subsection (a) of this section, but determines that <!-- PDFPage:805 -->the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is not a pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is a result of the limited capability or capacity of the recipient,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary may provide technical assistance for the recipient (directly or indirectly) that is designed to increase the capability and capacity of the recipient to administer assistance provided under this chapter in compliance with the requirements under this chapter, if the recipient enters into a performance agreement with the Secretary that specifies the compliance objectives that the recipient will be required to achieve by the termination date of the performance agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Performance agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The period of a performance agreement described in paragraph (1) shall be for 1 year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has failed to make a good faith effort to meet applicable compliance objectives, the Secretary shall determine the recipient to have failed to comply substantially with this chapter, and the recipient shall be subject to an action under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Referral for civil action</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of, or in addition to, any action authorized by subsection (a) of this section, if the Secretary has reason to believe that a recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this chapter, the Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount of the assistance furnished under this chapter that was not expended in accordance with it, or for mandatory or injunctive relief.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any recipient who receives notice under subsection (a) of this section of the termination, reduction, or limitation of payments under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may, not later than 60 days after receiving such notice, file with the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such State is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a petition for review of the action of the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon the filing of any petition under subparagraph (A), shall forthwith transmit copies of the petition to the Secretary and the Attorney General of the United States, who shall represent the Secretary in the litigation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall file in the court a record of the proceeding on which the Secretary based the action, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disposition</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Court proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm or modify the action of the Secretary or to set it aside in whole or in part.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States has undertaken a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the United States by&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) employing its resources to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of lower income; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) developing effective partnerships with governmental and private entities to accomplish the objectives referred to in subparagraph (A);</p>
<!-- PDFPage:813 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States has a special responsibility for the welfare of the Native peoples of the United States, including Native Hawaiians;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.) [former 48 U.S.C. 691 et seq.], the United States set aside 200,000 acres of land in the Federal territory that later became the State of Hawaii in order to establish a homeland for the native people of Hawaii&mdash;Native Hawaiians;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) despite the intent of Congress in 1920 to address the housing needs of Native Hawaiians through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), Native Hawaiians eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands have been foreclosed from participating in Federal housing assistance programs available to all other eligible families in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) although Federal housing assistance programs have been administered on a racially neutral basis in the State of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians continue to have the greatest unmet need for housing and the highest rates of overcrowding in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) among the Native American population of the United States, Native Hawaiians experience the highest percentage of housing problems in the United States, as the percentage&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) of housing problems in the Native Hawaiian population is 49 percent, as compared to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) 44 percent for American Indian and Alaska Native households in Indian country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) 27 percent for all other households in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) overcrowding in the Native Hawaiian population is 36 percent as compared to 3 percent for all other households in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of Native Hawaiians, as that term is defined in section 801 of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 [25 U.S.C. 4221] (as added by this subtitle), eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands are the most severe, as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the percentage of overcrowding in Native Hawaiian households on the Hawaiian Home Lands is 36 percent; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, which constitute 95 percent of the Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands, are in need of housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) applying the Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) 70.8 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have incomes that fall below the median family income; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) 50 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have incomes below 30 percent of the median family income;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) one-third of those Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands pay more than 30 percent of their income for shelter, and one-half of those Native Hawaiians face overcrowding;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the extraordinarily severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians demonstrate that Native Hawaiians who either reside on, or are eligible to reside on, Hawaiian Home Lands have been denied equal access to Federal low-income housing assistance programs available to other qualified residents of the United States, and that a more effective means of addressing their housing needs must be authorized;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing, and in order to address the continuing prevalence of extraordinarily severe housing needs among Native Hawaiians who either reside or are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands, Congress finds it necessary to extend the Federal low-income housing assistance available to American Indians and Alaska Natives under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) to those Native Hawaiians;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) under the treatymaking power of the United States, Congress had the constitutional authority to confirm a treaty between the United States and the government that represented the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended full diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to the State of Hawaii;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; and</p>
