<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the Nation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by using Federal resources to aid families and individuals seeking affordable <!-- PDFPage:708 -->homes in safe and healthy environments and, in particular, assisting responsible, deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal Government, State, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Constitution of the United States invests the Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the United States in helping tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan villages is acute and the Federal Government should work not only to provide housing assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in the development of private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for tribes and their members; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities should be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in Public Law 93&ndash;638 (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Primary objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national objectives of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:717 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assist and promote affordable housing activities to develop, maintain, and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas for occupancy by low-income Indian families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure better access to private mortgage markets for Indian tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency of Indian tribes and their members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to coordinate activities to provide housing for Indian tribes and their members with Federal, State, and local activities to further economic and community development for Indian tribes and their members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to plan for and integrate infrastructure resources for Indian tribes with housing development for tribes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to promote the development of private capital markets in Indian country and to allow such markets to operate and grow, thereby benefiting Indian communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible families</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided under paragraph (2), assistance under eligible housing activities under this chapter shall be limited to low-income Indian families on Indian reservations and other Indian areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception to low-income requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A recipient may provide assistance for homeownership activities under section 4132(2) of this title, model activities under section 4132(6) of this title, or loan guarantee activities under subchapter VI of this chapter to Indian families who are not low-income families, to the extent that the Secretary approves the activities pursuant to such section or subchapter because there is a need for housing for such families that cannot reasonably be met without such assistance. The Secretary shall establish limits on the amount of assistance that may be provided under this chapter for activities for families who are not low-income families.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-Indian families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a recipient may provide housing or housing assistance provided through affordable housing activities assisted with grant amounts under this chapter for a non-Indian family on an Indian reservation or other Indian area if the recipient determines that the presence of the family on the Indian reservation or other Indian area is essential to the well-being of Indian families and the need for housing for the family cannot reasonably be met without such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Preference for tribal members and other Indian families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Indian housing plan for an Indian tribe may require preference, for housing or housing assistance provided through affordable housing activities assisted with grant amounts provided under this chapter on behalf of such tribe, to be given (to the extent practicable) to Indian families who are members of such tribe, or to other Indian families. In any case in which the applicable Indian housing plan for an Indian tribe provides for preference under this paragraph, the recipient for the tribe shall ensure that housing activities that are assisted with grant amounts under this chapter for such tribe are subject to such preference.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.] and title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.] shall not apply to actions by Indian tribes under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Noncompliance because of technical incapacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary makes a finding under subsection (a) of this section, but determines that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not a pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is a result of the limited capability or capacity of the recipient,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary may provide technical assistance for the recipient (directly or indirectly) that is designed to increase the capability and capacity of the recipient to administer assistance provided under this chapter in compliance with the requirements under this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount of the assistance furnished under this chapter that was not expended in accordance with it, or for mandatory or injunctive relief.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review</h4>

No objection to the action of the Secretary shall be considered by the court unless such objection has been urged before the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disposition</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Court proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm or modify the action of the Secretary or to set it aside in whole or in part.

The court may order additional evidence to be taken by the Secretary, and to be made part of the record.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may modify the findings of fact of the Secretary, or make new findings, by reason of the new evidence so taken and filed with the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall file&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the recommendation of the Secretary, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original action of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Finality</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To such extent or in such amounts as provided in appropriations Acts, the Secretary may, subject to the limitations of this subchapter (including limitations designed to protect and maintain the viability of rental housing units owned or operated by the recipient that were developed under a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.]), and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, guarantee and make commitments to guarantee, the notes or other obligations issued by Indian tribes or tribally designated housing entities with tribal approval, for the purposes of financing affordable housing activities described in section 4132 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Lack of financing elsewhere</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A guarantee under this subchapter may be used to assist an Indian tribe or housing entity in obtaining financing only if the Indian tribe or housing entity has made efforts to obtain such financing without the use of such guarantee and cannot complete such financing consistent with the timely execution of the program plans without such guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations, have such maturities, and be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary. The Secretary may not deny a guarantee under this subchapter on the basis of the proposed repayment period for the note or other obligation, unless the period is more than 20 years or the Secretary determines that the period causes the guarantee to constitute an unacceptable financial risk.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on outstanding guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall be made with respect to any note or other obligation if the total outstanding notes or obligations of the issuer guaranteed under this subchapter (excluding any amount defeased under the contract entered into under section 4192(a)(1) of this title) would thereby exceed an amount equal to 5 times the amount of the grant approval for the issuer pursuant to subchapter III of this chapter.</p>
