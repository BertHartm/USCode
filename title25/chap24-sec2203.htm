<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the tribal land involved in an exchange is of greater or lesser value than the land for which it is being exchanged, the tribe may accept or give cash in such exchange in order to equalize the values of the property exchanged;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any proceeds from the sale of land or interests in land or proceeds received by the tribe to equalize an exchange made pursuant to this section shall be used exclusively for the purchase of other land or interests in land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Secretary shall maintain a separate trust account for each tribe selling or ex<!-- PDFPage:661 -->changing land pursuant to this section consisting of the proceeds of the land sales and exchanges and shall release such funds only for the purpose of buying lands under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) any tribe may retain the mineral rights to such sold or exchanged lands and the Secretary shall assist such tribe in determining the value of such mineral rights and shall take such value into consideration in determining the fair market value of such lands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conveyancing requirement; specific findings for nonexecution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary must execute such instrument of conveyance needed to effectuate a sale or exchange of tribal lands made pursuant to an approved tribal land consolidation plan unless he makes a specific finding that such sale or exchange is not in the best interest of the tribe or is not in compliance with the tribal land consolidation plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Below market value conveyance of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma homesites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may execute instruments of conveyance for less than fair market value to effectuate the transfer of lands used as homesites held, on December 17, 1991, by the United States in trust for the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.

<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">1991&mdash;Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 102&ndash;238, &sect;3(1), substituted &ldquo;(1) except as provided by subsection (c) of this section, the sale price&rdquo; for &ldquo;(1) the sale price&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 102&ndash;238, &sect;3(2), added subsec. (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">1984&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 98&ndash;608 amended subsec. (a) generally, substituting &ldquo;:&nbsp;<em>Provided</em>, That&mdash;&rdquo; for period at end and inserting five numbered pars., thereby correcting errors originally contained in this section as enacted by Pub. L. 97&ndash;459, the text of which had a portion of section 204 appearing in section 206 (classified to section 2205 of this title) as the result of inadvertent error in the execution of committee amendments (see House Report No. 97&ndash;908, Sept. 30, 1982) to the bill. Pub. L. 97&ndash;459 enacted subsec. (a) as ending with &ldquo;tribal landholdings.&rdquo;, and included portion of section 204 containing proviso and five numbered pars. within text of section 206.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 98&ndash;608 included subsec. (b) within this section and substituted a period for the dash after &ldquo;tribal land consolidation plan&rdquo;, thereby correcting errors originally contained in this section as enacted by Pub. L. 97&ndash;459, which, as the result of inadvertent error in the execution of committee amendments (see House Report No. 97&ndash;908, Sept. 30, 1982) to the bill, enacted subsec. (b) as part of section 206(b) of Pub. L. 97&ndash;459 and ended it with &ldquo;tribal land consolidation plan&mdash;&rdquo;.</p>
