<p class="note-body">The Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), is Pub. L. 95&ndash;471, Oct. 17, 1978, 92 Stat. 1325, as amended, which is classified principally to chapter 20 (&sect;1801 et seq.) of this title.

<p class="note-body">Section 2010 of this title, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original &ldquo;section 1129&rdquo;, meaning section 1129 of Pub.
