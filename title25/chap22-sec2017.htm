<p class="note-body">The Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), is Pub. L. <!-- PDFPage:580 -->95&ndash;471, Oct. 17, 1978, 92 Stat. 1325, as amended, which is classified principally to chapter 20 (&sect;1801 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1801 of this title and Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2010 of this title, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original &ldquo;section 1129&rdquo;, meaning section 1129 of Pub. L. 95&ndash;561, which is classified to section 2009 of this title, and was translated as reading &ldquo;section 1130&rdquo; to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 2010, not section 2009, contains provisions relating to local financial plans.</p>
