<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Publication; termination of Federal services; application of Federal and State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon removal of Federal restrictions on the property of each tribe and individual members thereof, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a proclamation declaring that the Federal trust relationship to the affairs of the tribe and its members has terminated. Thereafter individual members of the tribe shall not be entitled to any of the services performed by the United States for Indians because of their status as Indians, all statutes of the United States which affect Indians because of their status as Indians, excluding statutes that specifically refer to the tribe and its members, shall no longer be applicable to the members of the tribe, and the laws of the several States shall apply to the tribe and its members in the same manner as they apply to other citizens or persons within their jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Citizenship status unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall affect the status of the members of a tribe as citizens of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Education and training program; purposes; subjects; transportation; subsistence; contracts; other education programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the issuance of a proclamation in accordance with the provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized to undertake, within the limits of available appropriations, a special program of education and training designed to help the members of the tribe to earn a livelihood, to conduct their own affairs, and to assume their responsibilities as citizens without special services because of their status as Indians. Such program may include language training, orientation in non-Indian community customs and living standards, vocational training and related subjects, transportation to the place of training or instruction, and subsistence during the course of training or instruction. For the purposes of such program the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts or agreements with any Federal, State, or local governmental agency, corporation, association, or person. Nothing in this section shall preclude any Federal agency from undertaking any other program for the education and training of Indians with funds appropriated to it.</p>
