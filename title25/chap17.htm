<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the provision of safe water supply systems and sanitary sewage and solid waste disposal systems is primarily a health consideration and function;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Indian people suffer an inordinately high incidence of disease, injury, and illness directly attributable to the absence or inadequacy of such systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the long-term cost to the United States of treating and curing such disease, injury, and illness is substantially greater than the short-term cost of providing such systems and other preventive health measures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) many Indian homes and communities still lack safe water supply systems and sanitary sewage and solid waste disposal systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) it is in the interest of the United States, and it is the policy of the United States, that all Indian communities and Indian homes, new <!-- PDFPage:458 -->and existing, be provided with safe and adequate water supply systems and sanitary sewage waste disposal systems as soon as possible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority; assistance; transfer of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In furtherance of the findings and declarations made in subsection (a) of this section, Congress reaffirms the primary responsibility and authority of the Service to provide the necessary sanitation facilities and services as provided in section 2004a of title 42.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, acting through the Service, is authorized to provide under section 2004a of title 42&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Affairs is authorized to transfer funds appropriated under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301, et seq.) to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tribal capability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The financial and technical capability of an Indian tribe or community to safely operate and maintain a sanitation facility shall not be a prerequisite to the provision or construction of sanitation facilities by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance to Indian tribes and communities in an amount equal to the Federal share of the costs of operating, managing, and maintaining the facilities provided under the plan described in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;Federal share&rdquo; means 80 percent of the costs described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to Indian tribes with fewer than 1,000 enrolled members, the non-Federal portion of the costs of operating, managing, and maintaining such facilities may be provided, in part, through cash donations or in kind property, fairly evaluated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Eligibility of programs administered by Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Programs administered by Indian tribes or tribal organizations under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination Act [25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.] shall be eligible for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any funds appropriated pursuant to this section, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In preparing each report required under paragraph (1) (other than the initial report), the Secretary shall consult with Indian tribes and tribal organizations (including those tribes or tribal organizations operating health care programs or facilities under any contract entered into with the Service under the Indian Self-Determination Act [25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.]) to determine the sanitation needs of each tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The methodology used by the Secretary in determining sanitation deficiencies for purposes of paragraph (1) shall be applied uniformly to all Indian tribes and communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, the sanitation deficiency levels for an Indian tribe or community are as follows:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In awarding grants under this section, the Secretary shall give priority to tribes and tribal organizations that demonstrate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a need for increased ambulatory care services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) insufficient capacity to deliver such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of interest to United States upon cessation of facility</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is the natural or adopted child, step-child, foster-child, legal ward, or orphan of an eligible Indian, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is not otherwise eligible for the health services provided by the Service,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be eligible for all health services provided by the Service on the same basis and subject to the same rules that apply to eligible Indians until such individual attains 19 years of age. The existing and potential health needs of all such individuals shall be taken into consideration by the Service in determining the need for, or the allocation of, the health resources of the Service. If such an individual has been determined to be legally incompetent prior to attaining 19 years of age, such individual shall remain eligible for such services until one year after the date such disability has been removed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any spouse of an eligible Indian who is not an Indian, or who is of Indian descent but not otherwise eligible for the health services provided by the Service, shall be eligible for such health services if all of such spouses are made eligible, as a class, by an appropriate resolution <!-- PDFPage:486 -->of the governing body of the Indian tribe of the eligible Indian. The health needs of persons made eligible under this paragraph shall not be taken into consideration by the Service in determining the need for, or allocation of, its health resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Health facilities providing health service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary is authorized to provide health services under this subsection through health facilities operated directly by the Service to individuals who reside within the service area of a service unit and who are not eligible for such health services under any other subsection of this section or under any other provision of law if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Indian tribe (or, in the case of a multi-tribal service area, all the Indian tribes) served by such service unit requests such provision of health services to such individuals, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribes have jointly determined that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the provision of such health services will not result in a denial or diminution of health services to eligible Indians, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) there is no reasonable alternative health facility or services, within or without the service area of such service unit, available to meet the health needs of such individuals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of health facilities operated under a contract entered into under the Indian Self-Determination Act [25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.], the governing body of the Indian tribe or tribal organization providing health services under such contract is authorized to determine whether health services should be provided under such contract to individuals who are not eligible for such health services under any other subsection of this section or under any other provision of law. In making such determinations, the governing body of the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall take into account the considerations described in subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Persons receiving health services provided by the Service by reason of this subsection shall be liable for payment of such health services under a schedule of charges prescribed by the Secretary which, in the judgment of the Secretary, results in reimbursement in an amount not less than the actual cost of providing the health services. Notwithstanding section 1880(c) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395qq(c)], section 1642(a) of this title, or any other provision of law, amounts collected under this subsection, including medicare or medicaid reimbursements under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq.], shall be credited to the account of the facility providing the service and shall be used solely for the provision of health services within that facility.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1721. Congressional findings and declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and declarations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Maliseet Tribe are asserting claims for possession of lands within the State of Maine and for damages on the ground that the lands in question were originally transferred in violation of law, including, but without limitation, the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 137), or subsequent reenactments or versions thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Indians, Indian nations, and tribes and bands of Indians, other than the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, that once may have held aboriginal title to lands within the State of Maine long ago abandoned their aboriginal holdings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Penobscot Nation, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Penobscot Nation's Governor and Council, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Penobscot Nation which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Passamaquoddy Tribe, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Passamaquoddy Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Houlton Band Council, is the sole successor in interest, as to lands within the United States, to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Maliseet Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Substantial economic and social hardship to a large number of landowners, citizens, and communities in the State of Maine, and therefore to the economy of the State of Maine as a whole, will result if the aforementioned claims are not resolved promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) This subchapter represents a good faith effort on the part of Congress to provide the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians with a fair and just settlement of their land claims. In the absence of congressional action, these land claims would be pursued through the courts, a process which in all likelihood would consume many years and thereby promote hostility and uncertainty in the State of Maine to the ultimate detriment of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, their members, and all other citizens of the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The State of Maine, with the agreement of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, has enacted legislation defining the relationship between the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and their members, and the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Since 1820, the State of Maine has provided special services to the Indians residing within its borders, including the members of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indi<!-- PDFPage:501 -->ans. During this same period, the United States provided few special services to the respective tribe, nation, or band, and repeatedly denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for the said tribe, nation, and band. In view of this provision of special services by the State of Maine, requiring substantial expenditures by the State of Maine and made by the State of Maine without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Maine not be required further to contribute directly to this claims settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to remove the cloud on the titles to land in the State of Maine resulting from Indian claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to clarify the status of other land and natural resources in the State of Maine;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ratify the Maine Implementing Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine and the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the Penobscot Nation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to confirm that all other Indians, Indian nations and tribes and bands of Indians now or hereafter existing or recognized in the State of Maine are and shall be subject to all laws of the State of Maine, as provided herein.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;171, Nov. 26, 1991, 105 Stat. 1143, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings and Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Aroostook Band of Micmacs, as represented as of the time of passage of this Act by the Aroostook Micmac Council, is the sole successor in interest, as to lands within the United States, to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Micmac Nation which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Band was not referred to in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 [25 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.] because historical documentation of the Micmac presence in Maine was not available at that time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) This documentation does establish the historical presence of Micmacs in Maine and the existence of aboriginal lands in Maine jointly used by the Micmacs and other tribes to which the Micmacs could have asserted aboriginal title but for the extinguishment of all such claims by the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Aroostook Band of Micmacs, in both its history and its presence in Maine, is similar to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and would have received similar treatment under the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 if the information available today had been available to Congress and the parties at that time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) It is now fair and just to afford the Aroostook Band of Micmacs the same settlement provided to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for the settlement of that Band's claims, to the extent they would have benefited from inclusion in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Since 1820, the State of Maine has provided special services to the Indians residing within its borders, including the members of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs. During this same period, the United States provided few special services to the Band and repeatedly denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for the Indian groups in Maine. In view of this provision of special services by the State of Maine, requiring substantial expenditures by the State of Maine and made by the State of Maine without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Maine not be required further to contribute directly to this settlement.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this Act to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) provide Federal recognition of the Band;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) provide to the members of the Band the services which the United States provides to Indians because of their status as Indians; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) place $900,000 in a land acquisition fund and property tax fund for the future use of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) ratify the Micmac Settlement Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) One-half of the principal of the settlement fund shall be held in trust by the Secretary for the benefit of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the other half of the settlement fund shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Penobscot Nation. Each portion of the settlement fund shall be administered by the Secretary in accordance with reasonable terms established by the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation, respectively, and agreed to by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may not agree to terms which provide for investment of the settlement fund in a manner not in accordance with section 162a of this title, unless the respective tribe or nation first submits a specific waiver of liability on the part of the United States for any loss which may result from such an investment: <em>Provided, further</em>, That until such terms have been agreed upon, the Secretary shall fix the terms for the administration of the portion of the settlement fund as to which there is no agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under no circumstances shall any part of the principal of the settlement fund be distributed to either the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation, or to any member of either tribe or nation: <em>Provided, however</em>, That nothing herein shall prevent the Secretary from investing the principal of said fund in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall make available to the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation in quarterly payments, without any deductions except as expressly provided in section 1725(d)(2) of this title and without liability to or on the part of the United States, any income received from the investment of that portion of the settlement fund allocated to the respective tribe or nation, the use of which shall be free of regulation by the Secretary. The Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation annually shall each expend the income from $1,000,000 of their portion of the settlement fund for the benefit of their respective members who are over the age of sixty.

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) there is pending before the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut a civil action entitled &ldquo;Western Pequot Tribe of Indians against Holdridge Enterprises Incorporated, et al., Civil Action Numbered H76&ndash;193 (D. Conn.),&rdquo; which involves Indian claims to certain public and private lands within the town of Ledyard, Connecticut;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) the pendency of this lawsuit has placed a cloud on the titles to much of the land in the town of Ledyard, including lands not involved in the lawsuit, which has resulted in severe economic hardships for the residents of the town;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) the Congress shares with the State of Connecticut and the parties to the lawsuit a desire to remove all clouds on titles resulting from such Indian land claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) the parties to the lawsuit and others interested in the settlement of Indian land claims within the State of Connecticut have reached an agreement which requires implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States and the Legislature of the State of Connecticut;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) the Western Pequot Tribe, as represented as of October 18, 1983, by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Western Pequot Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Connecticut; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(f) the State of Connecticut is contributing twenty acres of land owned by the State of Connecticut to fulfill this subchapter. The State of Connecticut will construct and repair three sections of paved or gravel roadways within the reservation of the Tribe. The State of Connecticut has provided special services to the members of the Western Pequot Tribe residing within its borders. The United States has provided few, if any, special services to the Western Pequot Tribe and has denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for said Tribe. In view of the provision of land by the State of Connecticut, the provision of paved roadways by the State of Connecticut, and the provision of special services by the State of Connecticut without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Connecticut not be required to otherwise contribute directly to this claims settlement.</p>

The Fund shall be held in trust by the Secretary for the benefit of the Tribe and administered in accordance with this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Expenditure of Fund; private settlement lands; economic development plan; acquisition of land and natural resources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized and directed to expend, at the request of the Tribe, the Fund together with any and all income accruing to such Fund in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not less than $600,000 of the Fund shall be available until January 1, 1985, for the acquisition by the Secretary of private settlement lands. Subsequent to January 1, 1985, the Secretary shall determine whether and to what extent an amount less than $600,000 has been expended to acquire private settlement lands and shall make that amount available to the Tribe to be used in accordance with the economic development plan approved pursuant to paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall disburse all or part of the Fund together with any and all income accruing to such Fund (excepting the amount reserved in paragraph (2)) according to a plan to promote the economic development of the Tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Tribe shall submit an economic development plan to the Secretary and the Secretary shall approve such plan within sixty days of its submission if he finds that it is reasonably related to the economic development of the Tribe. If the Secretary does not approve such plan, he shall, at the time of his decision, set forth in writing and with particularity, the reasons for his disapproval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may not agree to terms which provide for the investment of the Fund in a manner inconsistent with section 162a of this title, unless the Tribe first submits a specific waiver of liability on the part of the United States for any loss which may result from such an investment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Tribe may, with the approval of the Secretary, alter the economic development plan subject to the conditions set forth in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Under no circumstances shall any part of the Fund be distributed to any member of the Tribe unless pursuant to the economic development plan approved by the Secretary under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As the Fund or any portion thereof is disbursed by the Secretary in accordance with this section, the United States shall have no further trust responsibility to the Tribe or its members with respect to the sums paid, any subsequent expenditures of these sums, or any property other than private settlement lands or services purchased with these sums.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Until the Tribe has submitted and the Secretary has approved the terms of the use of the Fund, the Secretary shall fix the terms for the administration of the portion of the Fund as to which there is no agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Lands or natural resources acquired under this subsection which are located within the settlement lands shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Land or natural resources acquired under this subsection which are located outside of the settlement lands shall be held in fee by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, and the United States shall have no further trust responsibility with respect to such land and natural resources.

<p class="statutory-body">(9) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 257 of title 40 and section 258a of title 40, the Secretary may acquire land or natural resources under this section from the ostensible owner of the land or natural resources only if the Secretary and the ostensible owner of the land or natural resources have agreed upon the identity of the land or natural resources to be sold and upon the purchase price and other terms of sale. Subject to the agreement required by the preceding sentence, the Secretary may institute condemnation proceedings in order to perfect title, satisfactory to the Attorney General, in the United States and condemn interests adverse to the ostensible owner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is pending before the United States District Court for the southern district of Florida a lawsuit by the Seminole Tribe which involves certain lands within the State and there are also claims by the tribe to other areas of Florida by virtue of an 1839 Executive order of the President and by right of non-extinguishment of aboriginal possession which has been asserted but not filed in court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the pendency of this lawsuit and these claims may result in economic hardships for residents of the State by clouding the titles to lands in the State, including lands not now involved in the lawsuit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the pendency of this lawsuit and these claims also have clouded the easement rights of the South Florida Water Management District in lands necessary for use as a water flowage and storage area, which is part of a federally authorized project for flood control and water management in central and southern Florida, and which is being used to provide and regulate a water supply for the residents of south Florida;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the State, the district, and the tribe have executed agreements for the purposes of resolving tribal land claims and settling the lawsuit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which include conveyance of land and payment of consideration to the tribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which require implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States and the Legislature of the State of Florida;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Congress shares with the parties to such agreements a desire to settle these Indian claims in the State of Florida without additional cost to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the water rights of the tribe, and that continued controversy over this should be settled by agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the State, the district, and the tribe have entered into a compact which, if approved by Congress and the Florida Legislature, creates specifically defined water rights in lieu of the undefined water rights claimed by the tribe.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Acceptance of land by Secretary in trust for Seminole Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any clouds on title, the Secretary is authorized and directed, as soon as practicable after December 31, 1987, to accept the transfer to the United States, to be held in trust and as a reservation for the use and benefit of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the approximate 15 sections of land being described as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning at the southwest corner of section 31, township 48 south, Range 35 east; thence easterly along the south border of sections 31, 32 and 33, township 48 south, Range 35 east, to the westernmost boundary of the levee 28 works in section 33, township 48 south, Range 35 east; thence continuing north along the westernmost boundary of the levee 28 works to the point at which the westernmost boundary of the levee 28 works intersects the southernmost boundary of the levee 4 works in section 9, township 48 south, Range 35 east; thence continuing westerly along the southernmost boundary of the levee 4 works to the point at which the southernmost boundary of the levee 4 works intersects the dividing line between township 48 south, Range 35 east and township 48 south, Range 34 east at the Broward County and Hendry County line; and thence continuing south along said line to the point of beginning; said lands situate, lying and being in Broward County, Florida.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Survey of Seminole Federal Reservations in Florida</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on December 31, 1987, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) conduct a cadastral survey of those portions of the Seminole Federal Reservations in Florida not previously surveyed by the Department of the Interior, including all lands taken into trust as reservations under the authority of this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publish the correct legal descriptions of the Seminole Reservations in the Federal Register within 180 days after the survey is completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acceptance of land in future by Secretary in trust for Seminole Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Settlement Agreement, there is a subsequent agreement between the tribe, the State, and the district providing that lands exchanged with the tribe or acquired by the tribe may be taken into Federal trust as a reservation for the tribe, the Secretary shall accept the transfer of such lands to the United States, to be held in trust for the use and benefit of the tribe pursuant to the terms and conditions of the subsequent agreement unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total amount of land previously taken in trust under this subsection exceeds the amount of land transferred to the State and Water District by the tribe under the Settlement Agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines in writing that either the size, location, or condition of the land, or the terms and conditions under which it is transferred would place an unreasonable burden on the United States as trustee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the land is not in Florida; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the land is not agricultural in nature.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil and criminal jurisdiction over lands acquired by United States in trust for Seminole Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the acquisition of any land under subsection (a) or (c) of this section by the United States in trust for the tribe, the assumption of jurisdiction in favor of the State contained in section 285.16, Florida Statutes, pursuant to section 7 of the Act of August 15, 1953,<sup><a href="#1772d_1_target" name="1772d_1">1</a></sup> (67 Stat. 588; Public Law 280), shall continue in full force and effect on such lands unless the United States accepts a retrocession by the State of such civil or criminal jurisdiction in whole or in part under section 1323 of this title. The laws of Florida relating to alcoholic beverages, gambling, sale of cigarettes, and their successor laws, shall have the same force and effect within said transferred lands as they have elsewhere within the State. The State, with respect to the transferred lands, shall also have jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians under said laws to the same extent the State has jurisdiction over said offenses committed elsewhere within the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as permitting the exercise of the above jurisdiction by the State regarding matters to which section 1162(b) of title 18 and section 1360(b) of title 28 apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The scope of tribal sovereignty over transferred lands, with the specific exceptions of law relating to cigarettes, gambling and alcohol described in this subsection, shall be as required by applicable law with regard to existing tribal lands held in reservation or Federal trust status. Such transfer shall not confer upon the tribe, or upon the lands within the reservation, any additional water rights. Tribal water rights shall be deemed to be defined in the compact.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to support the resolution of disputes over historical claims through settlements mutually agreed to by Indian and non-Indian parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Disputes over certain land claims of the Puyallup Tribe and other matters, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ownership of the Commencement Bay tidelands and areas of former Puyallup Riverbed, lands within the Puyallup Tribe's Treaty Reservation, or intended reservation boundaries,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) railroad and other rights-of-way,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) control of fisheries resource and habitat,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) jurisdiction over law enforcement, environment, navigation, and authority and control in the areas of land use,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) business regulation and zoning,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">have resulted in difficult community relations and negative economic impacts affecting both the Tribe and non-Indian parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Some of the significant historical events that led to the present circumstances include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the negotiation of the Treaty of Medicine Creek in December 1854, by the Puyallup Indians and others, by which the tribes ceded most of their territories but reserved certain lands and rights, including fishing rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Executive Order of 1857 creating the Puyallup Indian Reservation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Executive Order of 1873, clarifying and extending the Puyallup Reservation in the Washington Territory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the March 11, 1891, Report of the Puyallup Indian Commission on allotments and the 1896 report by a second Puyallup Indian Commission describing the problems with sales of allotted lands; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the 1909 District Court for Tacoma decision of the United States of America against J.M. Ashton and the 1910 Supreme Court decision of United States of America against J.M. Ashton.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It is recognized that both Indian and non-Indian parties enter into this settlement to resolve certain problems and claims and to derive certain benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) There is a recognition that any final resolution of pending disputes through a process of litigation would take many years and entail great expense to all parties; continue economically and socially damaging controversies; prolong uncertainty as to the access, ownership, and jurisdictional status of issues in question; and seriously impair long-term economic planning and development for all parties.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Therefore, it is the purpose of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to approve, ratify, and confirm the agreement entered into by the non-Indian settlement parties and the Puyallup Tribe of Indians,</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1774. Findings and purposes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) City of Salamanca and congressional villages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Disputes concerning leases of tribal lands within the city of Salamanca and the congressional villages, New York, have strained relations between the Indian and non-Indian communities and have resulted in adverse economic impacts affecting both communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Some of the significant historical events which have led to the present situation include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, several railroads obtained grants or leases of rights of way through the Allegany Reservation without Federal authorization or approval and on terms which did not adequately protect the interests of the Seneca Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after construction of these railroads, Allegany Reservation lands were leased to railroad employees, persons associated with the railroads, residents of the city and farmers without Federal authorization or approval and on terms which did not adequately protect the interests of the Seneca Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) none of these leases had Federal authorization or approval and, after the courts ruled these leases invalid, Congress enacted the Act of February 19, 1875 (18 Stat. 330), confirming existing leases of Allegany Reservation lands, authorizing further leasing by the Seneca Nation, and making the confirmed leases renewable for a twelve year period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Act of September 30, 1890 (26 Stat. 558), amended the 1875 Act by substituting a renewal term of &ldquo;not exceeding ninety-nine years&rdquo; for the original renewal term of twelve years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in 1952 the Seneca Nation filed a claim with the Indian Claims Commission against the United States for use of improper lease fees, and in 1977 a settlement was reached regarding such claim, providing for the payment of $600,000 to the Seneca Nation covering the period beginning in 1870 to the end of 1946.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An analysis of historic land values indicates that the payments made under the original lease agreement and under the settlement described in paragraph (2)(E) were well below the actual lease value of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The approaching expiration of the Salamanca and congressional village leases on February 19, 1991, has created significant uncertainty and concern on the part of the city of Salamanca and Salamanca residents, and among the residents of the congressional villages, many of whose families have resided on leased lands for generations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The future economic success of the Seneca Nation, city, and congressional villages is tied to the securing of a future lease agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Federal and State governments have agreed that there is a moral responsibility on the part of both governments to help secure a fair and equitable settlement for past inequities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to effectuate and support the Agreement between the city and the Seneca Nation, and facilitate the negotiation of new leases with lessees in the congressional villages;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:531 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist in resolving the past inequities involving the 1890 leases and to secure fair and equitable compensation for the Seneca Nation based on the impact of these leases on the economy and culture of the Seneca Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide a productive environment between the Seneca Nation and lessees for negotiating the leases provided for under the Agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide stability and security to the city and the congressional villages, their residents, and businesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to promote the economic growth of the city and the congressional villages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to promote economic self-sufficiency for the Seneca Nation and its members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to promote cooperative economic and community development efforts on the part of the Seneca Nation and the city; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to avoid the potential legal liability on the part of the United States that could be a direct consequence of not reaching a settlement.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut received recognition by the United States pursuant to the administrative process under part 83 of title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut is the successor in interest to the aboriginal entity known as the Mohegan Indian Tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Mohegan Tribe has existed in the geographic area that is currently the State of Connecticut for a long period preceding the colonial period of the history of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Certain lands were sequestered as tribal lands by the Colony of Connecticut and subsequently by the State of Connecticut.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut v. State of Connecticut, et al. (Civil Action No. H&ndash;77&ndash;434, pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Connecticut) relates to the ownership of certain lands within the State of Connecticut.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Such action will likely result in economic hardships for residents of the State of Connecticut, including residents of the town of Montville, Connecticut, by encumbering the title to lands in the State, including lands that are not currently the subject of the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The State of Connecticut and the Mohegan Tribe have executed agreements for the purposes of resolving all disputes between the State of Connecticut and the Mohegan Tribe and providing a settlement for the action referred to in paragraph (5).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:534 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) In order to implement the agreements referred to in paragraphs (5) and (6) of section 1775a of this title that address matters of jurisdiction with respect to certain offenses committed by and against members of the Mohegan Tribe and other Indians in Indian country and matters of gaming-related development, it is necessary for the Congress to enact legislation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The town of Montville, Connecticut, will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be affected by the loss of a tax base from, and jurisdiction over, lands that will be held in trust by the United States on behalf of the Mohegan Tribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve as the host community for the gaming operations of the Mohegan Tribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The town of Montville and the Mohegan Tribe have entered into an agreement to resolve issues extant between them and to establish the basis for a cooperative government-to-government relationship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To facilitate the settlement of claims against the State of Connecticut by the Mohegan Tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To facilitate the removal of any encumbrance to any title to land in the State of Connecticut that would have resulted from the action referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Under the treaty between the United States of America and the Crow Tribe of Indians concluded May 7, 1868 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868&rdquo;; 15 Stat. 649), the eastern boundary of the Crow Indian Reservation was established as the 107th meridian for approximately 90 miles from the Yellowstone River to the boundary between Montana and Wyoming.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Under Executive orders issued in 1884 and 1900, the western boundary of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation was established as the 107th meridian. The 107th meridian was intended to be the common boundary between the Crow Reservation and Northern Cheyenne Reservation for approximately 25 miles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) From 1889 through 1891, a survey was conducted of the eastern boundary of the Crow Reservation. The 1891 survey line strayed to the west, and resulted in the exclusion from the Crow Indian Reservation of a strip of land of approximately 36,164 acres. Approximately 12,964 acres of such strip of land were included in the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Deposits of low sulphur coal underlie the land excluded from the Crow Indian Reservation, including the land included in the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The erroneous nature of the survey was not discovered for several decades. Meanwhile, the areas along the 107th meridian to the north and south of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation were opened to settlement in the late nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century. Patents were issued to non-Indian persons and to the State of Montana for most of the surface land and a significant portion of the minerals in these areas between the 107th meridian and the 1891 survey line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The 12,964 acres included in the Northern Cheyenne Reservation have been treated as part of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation and occupied by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Northern Cheyenne allottees, and their successors in interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Legislation to resolve the 107th meridian boundary dispute was introduced in Congress in the 1960's and 1970's, and again in 1992, but no such legislation was enacted into law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to settle the 107th meridian boundary dispute created by the erroneous survey of the eastern boundary of the Crow Indian Reservation made by the Federal Government described in subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>
