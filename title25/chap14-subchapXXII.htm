<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Full agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, within one hundred and eighty days after the first session scheduled by the Mediator under section 640d&ndash;1(c) of this title, full agreement is reached, such agreement shall be put in such form as the Mediator determines best expresses the intent of the tribes and shall then be submitted to the Secretary and the Attorney General of the United States for their comments as they relate to the interest of the United States in the proceedings. These comments are to be submitted to the Mediator and the negotiating teams within thirty days. The negotiating teams and the Mediator shall then consider the comments and, if agreement can still be reached on terms acceptable to the negotiating teams and the Mediator within sixty days of receipt by him of the comments, the agreement shall be put in final written form and shall be signed by the members of the negotiating teams and the Mediator. The Mediator shall then cause the agreement to be entered into the records of the supplemental proceedings in the Healing case. The provisions of the agreement shall be reviewed by the District Court, modified where necessary, and put into effect immediately thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Partial agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, within the one hundred and eighty day period referred to in subsection (a) of this section, a partial agreement has been reached between the tribes and they wish such partial agreement to go into effect, they shall follow the procedure set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consistency with existing law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, the negotiating teams may make any provision in the agreement or partial agreement not inconsistent with existing law. No such agreement or any provision in it shall result in a taking by the United States of private property compensable under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Mediator in preparing his report, and the District Court in making the final adjudication, pursuant to section 640d&ndash;3 of this title, shall consider and be guided by the decision of the Healing case, under which the tribes have joint, undivided, and equal interests in and to all of the joint use area; by any partial agreement reached by the parties under section 640d&ndash;2(b) of this title; by the last best offer for a complete settlement as a part of the negotiating process by each of the tribes; and by the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The rights and interests, as defined in the Healing case, of the Hopi Tribe in and to that portion of the reservation established by the Executive order of December 16, 1882, which is known as land management district no. 6 (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Hopi Reservation&rdquo;) shall not be reduced or limited in any manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The boundary lines resulting from any partitioning of lands in the joint use area shall be established so as to include the higher density population areas of each tribe within the portion of the lands partitioned to such tribe to minimize and avoid undue social, economic, and cultural disruption insofar as practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In any division of the surface rights to the joint use area, reasonable provision shall be made for the use of and right of access to identified religious shrines for the members of each tribe on the reservation of the other tribe where such use and access are for religious purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any partition of the surface rights to the joint use area, the lands shall, insofar as is practicable, be equal in acreage and quality: <em>Provided</em>, That if such partition results in a lesser amount of acreage, or value, or both to one tribe such differential shall be fully and finally compensable to such tribe by the other tribe. The value of the land for the purposes of this subsection shall be based on not less than its value with improvements and its grazing capacity fully restored: <em>Provided further</em>, That, in the determination of compensation for any such differential, the Federal Government shall pay any difference between the value of the particular land involved in its existing state and the value of such land in a fully restored state which results from damage to the land which the District Court finds attributable to a failure of the Federal Government to provide protection where such protection is or was required by law or by the demands of the trust relationship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any lands partitioned to each tribe in the joint use area shall, where feasible and consistent with the other provisions of this section, be contiguous to the reservation of each such tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any boundary line between lands partitioned to the two tribes in the joint use area shall, insofar as is practicable, follow terrain which will facilitate fencing or avoid the need for fencing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any claim the Hopi Tribe may have against the Navajo Tribe for an accounting of all sums collected by the Navajo Tribe since September 17, 1957, as trader license fees or commissions, lease rental, or proceeds, or other similar charges for doing business or for dam<!-- PDFPage:251 -->ages in the use of lands within the joint use area, shall be for a one-half share in such sums.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any claim the Hopi Tribe may have against the Navajo Tribe for the determination and recovery of the fair value of the grazing and agricultural use of the lands within the joint use area by the Navajo Tribe and its individual members, since September 28, 1962, shall be for one-half of such value.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization to commence and defend actions in District Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Either tribe, acting through the chairman of its tribal council for and on behalf of the tribe, is each hereby authorized to commence or defend in the District Court an action against the other tribe and any other tribe of Indians claiming any interest in or to the area described in the Act of June 14, 1934, except the reservation established by the Executive Order of December 16, 1882, for the purpose of determining the rights and interests of the tribes in and to such lands and quieting title thereto in the tribes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of land to respective reservations upon determination of interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Lands, if any, in which the Navajo Tribe or Navajo individuals are determined by the District Court to have the exclusive interest shall continue to be a part of the Navajo Reservation. Lands, if any, in which the Hopi Tribe, including any Hopi village or clan thereof, or Hopi individuals are determined by the District Court to have the exclusive interest shall thereafter be a reservation for the Hopi Tribe. Any lands in which the Navajo and Hopi Tribes or Navajo or Hopi individuals are determined to have a joint or undivided interest shall be partitioned by the District Court on the basis of fairness and equity and the area so partitioned shall be retained in the Navajo Reservation or added to the Hopi Reservation, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions for accounting, fair value of grazing, and claims for damages to land; determination of recovery; defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Either as a part of or in a proceeding supplementary to the action authorized in subsection (a) of this section, either tribe, through the chairman of its tribal council for and on behalf of the tribe, including all villages, clans, and individual members thereof, may prosecute or defend an action for the types of relief, including interest, specified in section 640d&ndash;17 of this title, including all subsections thereof, against the other tribe, through its tribal chairman in a like representative capacity, and against the United States as to the types of recovery specified in subsection (a)(3) of section 640d&ndash;17 of this title and subject to the same provisions as contained in said subsection, such action to apply to the lands in issue in the reservation established by the Act of June 14, 1934 (48 Stat. 960).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event the Hopi Tribe or Navajo Tribe is determined to have any interest in the lands in issue, the right of either tribe to recover hereunder shall be based upon that percentage of the total sums collected, use made, waste committed, and other amounts of recovery, which is equal to the percentage of lands in issue in which either tribe is determined to have such interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Neither laches nor the statute of limitations shall constitute a defense to such proceedings if they are either prosecuted as a part of the action authorized by this section or in a proceeding supplemental thereto, if instituted not later than twenty-four months following a final order of partition and exhaustion of appeals in an action filed pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Denial of Congressional interest in merits of conflicting claims; liability of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be deemed to be a Congressional determination of the merits of the conflicting claims to the lands that are subject to adjudication pursuant to this section, or to affect the liability of the United States, if any, under litigation now pending before the Indian Claims Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of legal fees, court costs and other expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to pay any or all appropriate legal fees, court costs, and other related expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the commencing of, or defending against, any action brought by the Navajo, San Juan Southern Paiute or Hopi Tribe under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Provision of attorney fees for San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any funds made available for the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe to pay for attorney's fees shall be paid directly to the tribe's attorneys of record until such tribe is acknowledged as an Indian tribe by the United States: <em>Provided</em>, That the tribe's eligibility for such payments shall cease once a decision by the Secretary of the Interior declining to acknowledge such tribe becomes final and no longer appealable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as a congressional acknowledgement of the San Juan Southern Paiute as an Indian tribe or as affecting in any way the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe's Petition for Recognition currently pending with the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) There is hereby authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $250,000 to pay for the legal expenses incurred by the Southern Paiute Tribe <!-- PDFPage:252 -->on legal action arising under this section prior to November 16, 1988.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Subject to the provisions of the following sentences of this subsection, all rights, title and interests of the United States in the lands described in paragraph (1), including such interests the United States as lessor has in such lands under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], will, subject to existing leasehold interests, be transferred without cost to the Navajo Tribe and title thereto shall be taken by the United States in trust for the benefit of the Navajo Tribe as a part of the Navajo Reservation. So long as selected lands coincide with pending noncompetitive coal lease applications under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, the Secretary may not transfer any United States interests in such lands until the noncompetitive coal lease applications have been fully adjudicated. If such adjudication results in issuance of Federal coal leases to the applicants, such transfer shall be subject to such leases. The leaseholders rights and interests in such coal leases will in no way be diminished by the transfer of the rights, title and interests of the United States in such lands to the Navajo Tribe. If any selected lands are subject to valid claims located under the Mining Law of 1872 the transfer of the selected lands may be made subject to those claims.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A border of any parcel of land so transferred or acquired shall be within eighteen miles of the present boundary of the Navajo Reservation: <em>Provided</em>, That, except as limited by subsection (g) of this section, Bureau of Land Management lands anywhere within the States of Arizona and New Mexico may be used for the purpose of exchanging for lands within eighteen miles of the present boundary of the reservation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Acquisition of title to surface and subsurface interest; time period; public notice; report to Congressional committees; rights of subsurface owner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For a period of three years after July 8, 1980, the Secretary shall not accept title to lands acquired pursuant to subsection (a)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#640d-10_4_target" name="640d-10_4">4</a></sup> of this section unless fee title to both surface and subsurface has been acquired or the owner of the subsurface interest consents to the acceptance of the surface interest in trust by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Lands not available for transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No public lands lying north and west of the Colorado River in the State of Arizona shall be available for transfer under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Appeals of eligibility determinations</h4>
