<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a substantial number of Indian students have partially completed their degrees in postsecondary education, but have been unable, for a number of reasons, to complete the degrees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in at least some measure these students have been supported by tribal funds or grants of Federal monies administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or tribes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the inability of the students to complete these degrees has led to a hardship for the students and a loss of a potential pool of talent to the tribes or tribal organizations which originally financed, at least in part, these efforts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) this loss has crippled tribal efforts in the areas of economic and social development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) this failure to complete the postsecondary schooling has led to economic loss to the tribes and the Federal Government which could be remedied by completion of the courses of study; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a program to identify students with a level of postsecondary completion short of the fulfillment of graduation requirements and to encourage them to complete these requirements, including provision of resources, will benefit the students, the tribes, and the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to establish a revolving loan program to be administered by a tribe or tribal organization for the purposes of increasing the number of college graduates available to work in tribal businesses, tribal government, and tribal services such as schools and hospitals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to conduct research to assess the situational and educational barriers to participation in postsecondary education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to encourage development, through grants, of a model which provides, in addition to loans, transitional and follow-up services needed to encourage persistence in postsecondary education.</p>
