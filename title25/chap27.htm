<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, after careful review of the Federal Government's historical and special legal relationship with, and resulting responsibilities to, Indians, finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.], which was a product of the legitimate aspirations and a recognition of the inherent authority of Indian nations, was and is a crucial positive step towards tribal and community control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Bureau of Indian Affairs&rsquo; administration and domination of the contracting process under such Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] has not provided the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of self-government, and has denied to the Indian people an effective voice in the planning and <!-- PDFPage:604 -->implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians which are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Indians will never surrender their desire to control their relationships both among themselves and with the non-Indian governments, organizations, and persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process which will ensure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Federal administration of education for Indian children has not effected the desired level of educational achievement nor created the diverse opportunities and personal satisfaction which education can and should provide;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) true local control requires the least possible Federal interference; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the time has come to enhance the concepts made manifest in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.].</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes the obligation of the United States to respond to the strong expression of the Indian people for self-determination by assuring maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational services so as to render such services more responsive to the needs and desires of those communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commitment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing trust relationship with and responsibility to the Indian people through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy for education which will deter further perpetuation of Federal bureaucratic domination of programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) National goal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a major national goal of the United States is to provide the resources, processes, and structures which will enable tribes and local communities to effect the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Educational needs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress affirms the reality of the special and unique educational needs of Indian peoples, including the need for programs to meet the linguistic and cultural aspirations of Indian tribes and communities. These may best be met through a grant process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal relations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares its commitment to these policies and its support, to the full extent of its responsibility, for Federal relations with the Indian Nations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby repudiates and rejects House Concurrent Resolution 108 of the 83rd Congress and any policy of unilateral termination of Federal relations with any Indian Nation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No more than one grant may be provided under this chapter with respect to any Indian tribe or tribal organization for any fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Funds provided under any grant made under this chapter may not be expended for administrative costs (as defined under section 1128A(e)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2503_1_target" name="2503_1">1</a></sup> of the Education Amendments of 1978) in excess of the amount generated for such costs under section 1128A&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2503_1_target" name="2503_1">1</a></sup> of such Act.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">at any other schoolsite.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;schoolsite&rdquo; means the physical location and the facilities of an elementary or secondary educational or residential program operated by, or under contract with, the Bureau for which a discreet student count is identified under the funding formula established under section 1128&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2503_1_target" name="2503_1">1</a></sup> of the Education Amendments of 1978.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) No requirement to accept grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter may be construed&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to allow any person to coerce any tribe or tribal organization into applying for, or accepting,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">a grant under this chapter to plan, conduct, and administer all of, or any portion of, any Bureau program. Such applications, and the timing of such applications, shall be strictly voluntary. Nothing in this chapter may be construed as allowing or requiring any grant with any entity other than the entity to which the grant is provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) No effect on Federal responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Grants provided under this chapter shall not terminate, modify, suspend, or reduce the responsibility of the Federal Government to provide a program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Retrocession</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2503_2_target" name="2503_2">2</a></sup> tribal governing body requests retrocession of any program for which assistance is provided under this chapter, such retrocession shall become effective upon a date specified by the Secretary not more than 120 days after the date on which the tribal governing body requests the retrocession, or such later date as may be mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and the tribal governing body. If such a program is retroceded, the Secretary shall provide to any Indian tribe served by such program at least the same quantity and quality of services that would have been provided under such program at the level of funding provided under this chapter prior to the retrocession. The tribe requesting retrocession shall specify whether the retrocession is to status as a Bureau school or as a contract school under title XI of the Education Amendments of 1978 [25 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.]. Except as otherwise determined by the Secretary, the tribe or tribal organization operating the program to be retroceded must transfer to the Secretary (or to the tribe or tribal organization which will operate the program as a contract school) the existing equipment and materials which were acquired&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with assistance under this chapter, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon assumption of operation of the program under this chapter if it was a Bureau funded school under title XI of the Education Amendments of 1978 before receiving assistance under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) No termination for administrative convenience</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Grants provided under this Act&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2503_3_target" name="2503_3">3</a></sup> may not be terminated, modified, suspended, or reduced only for the convenience of the administering agency.</p>
