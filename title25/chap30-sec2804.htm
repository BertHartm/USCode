<p class="note-body">Section 458ccc&ndash;1(a) of this title, referred to in subsec. (g)(2), was in the original &ldquo;section 701(a) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act&rdquo;, and was translated as reading &ldquo;section 702(a) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act&rdquo;, meaning section 702(a) of Pub. L. 93&ndash;638, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 93&ndash;638 does not contain a section 701(a), and section 702(a) of Pub. L. 93&ndash;638 relates to establishment of the Indian Law Enforcement Foundation.</p>
