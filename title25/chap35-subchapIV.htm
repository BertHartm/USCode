<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Education is authorized to make grants, in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, to federally recognized Indian tribes which lack sufficient numbers of professionally trained tribal members to support established or ongoing economic development initiatives. Priority shall be given to tribes which are not served by federally funded postsecondary institutions. The purpose of such grants is to enable such tribes to make scholarships available to tribal members to assist such members to pursue courses of study leading to an undergraduate or postbaccalaureate degree in order to provide professionally trained tribal members to support such economic development initiatives on Indian reservations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A scholarship awarded under this subchapter shall be referred to as an &ldquo;American Indian Post-Secondary Economic Development Scholarship&rdquo; (hereafter referred to in this subchapter as &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo;).</p>
