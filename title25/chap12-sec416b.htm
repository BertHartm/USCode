<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior shall, before he approves any lease under sections 416 to 416j of this title for public, religious, educational, recreational, business, or residential purposes and if he determines that such lease will substantially affect the governmental interests of a municipality described hereunder, notify the appropriate authorities of any municipality contiguous to the San Xavier or Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservation, as the case may be, of the pendency of the proposed lease and, in his discretion, furnish them with an outline of the major provisions of the lease which affect such governmental interests and shall consider any comments on the terms of the lease affecting the municipality, or on the absence of such terms from the lease, that such authorities may offer within such reasonable period, but not more than thirty days, as the Secretary may prescribe in his notice to them.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Development by non-Indian lessees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intent of the Congress that the terms under which lands located on the San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations are developed by non-Indian lessees shall, to the extent reasonably possible, be similar to those applicable under State or local law to the development of non-Indian lands in the municipalities contiguous thereto.</p>
