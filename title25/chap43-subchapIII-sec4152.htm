<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, by regulations issued not later than the expiration of the 12-month period beginning on October 26, 1996, in the manner provided under section 4116 of this title, establish a formula to provide for allocating amounts available for a fiscal year for block grants under this chapter among Indian tribes in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors for determination of need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The formula shall be based on factors that reflect the need of the Indian tribes and the Indian areas of the tribes for assistance for affordable housing activities, including the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The number of low-income housing dwelling units owned or operated at the time pursuant to a contract between an Indian housing authority for the tribe and the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The extent of poverty and economic distress and the number of Indian families within Indian areas of the tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Other objectively measurable conditions as the Secretary and the Indian tribes may specify.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Other factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing the formula, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the relative administrative capacities and other challenges faced by the recipient, including, but not limited to geographic distribution within the Indian area and technical capacity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which terminations of assistance under subchapter V of this chapter will affect funding available to State recognized tribes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funding for public housing operation and modernization</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Full funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The formula shall provide that, if, in any fiscal year, the total amount made available for assistance under this chapter is equal to or greater than the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of public housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], the amount provided for such fiscal year for each Indian tribe for which such operating or modernization assistance was provided for fiscal year 1996 shall not be less than the total amount of such operating and modernization assistance provided for fiscal year 1996 for such tribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Partial funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The formula shall provide that, if, in any fiscal year, the total amount made available for assistance under this chapter is less than the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of public housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], the amount provided for such fiscal year for each Indian tribe for which such operating or modernization assistance was provided for fiscal year 1996 shall not be less than the amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount available for assistance under this chapter for such fiscal year that the amount of operating and modernization assistance provided for the tribe for fiscal year 1996 bears to the total amount made available for fiscal year 1996 for assistance for the operation and modernization of such public housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effective date</h4>
