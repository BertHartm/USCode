<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Tribe shall submit an economic development plan to the Secretary and the Secretary shall approve such plan within sixty days of its submission if he finds that it is reasonably related to the economic development of the Tribe.

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may not agree to terms which provide for the investment of the Fund in a manner inconsistent with section 162a of this title, unless the Tribe first submits a specific waiver of liability on the part of the United States for any loss which may result from such an investment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Under no circumstances shall any part of the Fund be distributed to any member of the Tribe unless pursuant to the economic development plan approved by the Secretary under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As the Fund or any portion thereof is disbursed by the Secretary in accordance with this section, the United States shall have no further trust responsibility to the Tribe or its members with respect to the sums paid, any subsequent expenditures of these sums, or any property other than private settlement lands or services purchased with these sums.</p>
