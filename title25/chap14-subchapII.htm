<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings respecting historical and special legal relationship, and resultant responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, after careful review of the Federal Government's historical and special legal relationship with, and resulting responsibilities to, American Indian people, finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the prolonged Federal domination of Indian service programs has served to retard rather than enhance the progress of Indian people and their communities by depriving Indians of the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of self-government, and has denied to the Indian people an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians which are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Indian people will never surrender their desire to control their relationships both among themselves and with non-Indian governments, organizations, and persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process which will insure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Federal responsibility for and assistance to education of Indian children has not effected the desired level of educational achievement or created the diverse opportunities and personal satisfaction which education can and should provide; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:146 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) parental and community control of the educational process is of crucial importance to the Indian people.</p>

Ord. No. 13175, &sect;9(c), Nov. 6, 2000, 65 F.R. 67251, set out below.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13175. Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13175, Nov. 6, 2000, 65 F.R. 67249, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have tribal implications, to strengthen the United States government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes, and to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon Indian tribes; it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Definitions</em>. For purposes of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Policies that have tribal implications&rdquo; refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Indian tribe&rdquo; means an Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as <!-- PDFPage:147 -->an Indian tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 479a.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; means any authority of the United States that is an &ldquo;agency&rdquo; under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) &ldquo;Tribal officials&rdquo; means elected or duly appointed officials of Indian tribal governments or authorized intertribal organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Fundamental Principles</em>. In formulating or implementing policies that have tribal implications, agencies shall be guided by the following fundamental principles:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The United States has a unique legal relationship with Indian tribal governments as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and court decisions. Since the formation of the Union, the United States has recognized Indian tribes as domestic dependent nations under its protection. The Federal Government has enacted numerous statutes and promulgated numerous regulations that establish and define a trust relationship with Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Our Nation, under the law of the United States, in accordance with treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and judicial decisions, has recognized the right of Indian tribes to self-government. As domestic dependent nations, Indian tribes exercise inherent sovereign powers over their members and territory. The United States continues to work with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis to address issues concerning Indian tribal self-government, tribal trust resources, and Indian tribal treaty and other rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The United States recognizes the right of Indian tribes to self-government and supports tribal sovereignty and self-determination.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Policymaking Criteria</em>. In addition to adhering to the fundamental principles set forth in section 2, agencies shall adhere, to the extent permitted by law, to the following criteria when formulating and implementing policies that have tribal implications:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Agencies shall respect Indian tribal self-government and sovereignty, honor tribal treaty and other rights, and strive to meet the responsibilities that arise from the unique legal relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) With respect to Federal statutes and regulations administered by Indian tribal governments, the Federal Government shall grant Indian tribal governments the maximum administrative discretion possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) When undertaking to formulate and implement policies that have tribal implications, agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) encourage Indian tribes to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) where possible, defer to Indian tribes to establish standards; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) in determining whether to establish Federal standards, consult with tribal officials as to the need for Federal standards and any alternatives that would limit the scope of Federal standards or otherwise preserve the prerogatives and authority of Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Special Requirements for Legislative Proposals</em>. Agencies shall not submit to the Congress legislation that would be inconsistent with the policymaking criteria in Section 3.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Consultation</em>. (a) Each agency shall have an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of regulatory policies that have tribal implications. Within 30 days after the effective date of this order, the head of each agency shall designate an official with principal responsibility for the agency's implementation of this order. Within 60 days of the effective date of this order, the designated official shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a description of the agency's consultation process.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) To the extent practicable and permitted by law, no agency shall promulgate any regulation that has tribal implications, that imposes substantial direct compliance costs on Indian tribal governments, and that is not required by statute, unless:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) funds necessary to pay the direct costs incurred by the Indian tribal government or the tribe in complying with the regulation are provided by the Federal Government; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the agency, prior to the formal promulgation of the regulation,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) consulted with tribal officials early in the process of developing the proposed regulation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the Federal Register, provides to the Director of OMB a tribal summary impact statement, which consists of a description of the extent of the agency's prior consultation with tribal officials, a summary of the nature of their concerns and the agency's position supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the concerns of tribal officials have been met; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) makes available to the Director of OMB any written communications submitted to the agency by tribal officials.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) To the extent practicable and permitted by law, no agency shall promulgate any regulation that has tribal implications and that preempts tribal law unless the agency, prior to the formal promulgation of the regulation,</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) consulted with tribal officials early in the process of developing the proposed regulation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the Federal Register, provides to the Director of OMB a tribal summary impact statement, which consists of a description of the extent of the agency's prior consultation with tribal officials, a summary of the nature of their concerns and the agency's position supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the concerns of tribal officials have been met; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) makes available to the Director of OMB any written communications submitted to the agency by tribal officials.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) On issues relating to tribal self-government, tribal trust resources, or Indian tribal treaty and other rights, each agency should explore and, where appropriate, use consensual mechanisms for developing regulations, including negotiated rulemaking.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Increasing Flexibility for Indian Tribal Waivers.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Agencies shall review the processes under which Indian tribes apply for waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements and take appropriate steps to streamline those processes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, consider any application by an Indian tribe for a waiver of statutory or regulatory requirements in connection with any program administered by the agency with a general view toward increasing opportunities for utilizing flexible policy approaches at the Indian tribal level in cases in which the proposed waiver is consistent with the applicable Federal policy objectives and is otherwise appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, render a decision upon a complete application for a waiver within 120 days of receipt of such application by the agency, or as otherwise provided by law or regulation. If the application for waiver is not granted, the agency shall provide the applicant with timely written notice of the decision and the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This section applies only to statutory or regulatory requirements that are discretionary and subject to waiver by the agency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Accountability.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) In transmitting any draft final regulation that has tribal implications to OMB pursuant to Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 [5 U.S.C. 601 note], each agency shall include a certification from the official designated to ensure compliance with this order stating that the requirements of this order have been met in a meaningful and timely manner.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In transmitting proposed legislation that has tribal implications to OMB, each agency shall include a <!-- PDFPage:148 -->certification from the official designated to ensure compliance with this order that all relevant requirements of this order have been met.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Within 180 days after the effective date of this order the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs shall confer with tribal officials to ensure that this order is being properly and effectively implemented.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Government-to-Government Relations With Native American Tribal Governments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 29, 1994, 59 F.R. 22951, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States Government has a unique legal relationship with Native American tribal governments as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, and court decisions. As executive departments and agencies undertake activities affecting Native American tribal rights or trust resources, such activities should be implemented in a knowledgeable, sensitive manner respectful of tribal sovereignty. Today, as part of an historic meeting, I am outlining principles that executive departments and agencies, including every component bureau and office, are to follow in their interactions with Native American tribal governments. The purpose of these principles is to clarify our responsibility to ensure that the Federal Government operates within a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized Native American tribes. I am strongly committed to building a more effective day-to-day working relationship reflecting respect for the rights of self-government due the sovereign tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to ensure that the rights of sovereign tribal governments are fully respected, executive branch activities shall be guided by the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The head of each executive department and agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the department or agency operates within a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each executive department and agency shall consult, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, with tribal governments prior to taking actions that affect federally recognized tribal governments. All such consultations are to be open and candid so that all interested parties may evaluate for themselves the potential impact of relevant proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Each executive department and agency shall assess the impact of Federal Government plans, projects, programs, and activities on tribal trust resources and assure that tribal government rights and concerns are considered during the development of such plans, projects, programs, and activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Each executive department and agency shall take appropriate steps to remove any procedural impediments to working directly and effectively with tribal governments on activities that affect the trust property and/or governmental rights of the tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Each executive department and agency shall work cooperatively with other Federal departments and agencies to enlist their interest and support in cooperative efforts, where appropriate, to accomplish the goals of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Each executive department and agency shall apply the requirements of Executive Orders Nos. 12875 (&ldquo;Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership&rdquo;) [former 5 U.S.C. 601 note] and 12866 (&ldquo;Regulatory Planning and Review&rdquo;) [5 U.S.C. 601 note] to design solutions and tailor Federal programs, in appropriate circumstances, to address specific or unique needs of tribal communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department and agency shall ensure that the department or agency's bureaus and components are fully aware of this memorandum, through publication or other means, and that they are in compliance with its requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right to administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Request by tribe; authorized programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is directed, upon the request of any Indian tribe by tribal resolution, to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts with a tribal organization to plan, conduct, and administer programs or portions thereof, including construction programs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provided for in the Act of April 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 596), as amended [25 U.S.C. 452 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which the Secretary is authorized to administer for the benefit of Indians under the Act of November 2, 1921 (42 Stat. 208) [25 U.S.C. 13], and any Act subsequent thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Act of August 5, 1954 (68 Stat. 674), as amended [42 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) administered by the Secretary for the benefit of Indians for which appropriations are made to agencies other than the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of the Interior; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians without regard to the agency or office of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of the Interior within which it is performed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The programs, functions, services, or activities that are contracted under this paragraph shall include administrative functions of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services (whichever is applicable) that support the delivery of services to Indians, including those administrative activities supportive of, but not included as part of, the service delivery programs described in this paragraph that are otherwise contractable. The administrative functions referred to in the preceding sentence shall be contractable without regard to the organizational level within the Department that carries out such functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If so authorized by an Indian tribe under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a tribal organization may submit a proposal for a self-determination contract, or a proposal to amend or renew a self-determination contract, to the Secretary for review. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4), the Secretary shall, within ninety days after receipt of the proposal, approve the proposal and award the contract unless the Secretary provides written notification to the applicant that contains a specific finding that clearly demonstrates that, or that is supported by a controlling legal authority that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the particular program or function to be contracted will not be satisfactory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the proposed project or function to be contracted for cannot be properly completed or maintained by the proposed contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the program, function, service, or activity (or portion thereof) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities covered under paragraph (1) because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may extend or otherwise alter the 90-day period specified in the second sentence of this subsection,<sup><a href="#450f_1_target" name="450f_1">1</a></sup> if before the expiration of such period, the Secretary obtains the voluntary and express written consent of the tribe or tribal organization to extend or otherwise alter such period. The contractor shall include in the proposal of the contractor the standards under which the tribal organization will operate the contracted program, service, function, or activity, including in the area of construction, provisions regarding the use of licensed and qualified architects, applicable health and safety standards, adherence to applicable Federal, State, local, or tribal building codes and engineering standards. The standards referred to in the preceding sentence shall ensure structural integrity, accountability of funds, adequate competition for subcontracting under tribal or other applicable law, the commencement, performance, <!-- PDFPage:154 -->and completion of the contract, adherence to project plans and specifications (including any applicable Federal construction guidelines and manuals), the use of proper materials and workmanship, necessary inspection and testing, and changes, modifications, stop work, and termination of the work when warranted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the request of a tribal organization that operates two or more mature self-determination contracts, those contracts may be consolidated into one single contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall approve any severable portion of a contract proposal that does not support a declination finding described in paragraph (2). If the Secretary determines under such paragraph that a contract proposal&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proposes in part to plan, conduct, or administer a program, function, service, or activity that is beyond the scope of programs covered under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) proposes a level of funding that is in excess of the applicable level determined under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">subject to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and the tribal organization agree to, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, approve such portion of the program, function, service, or activity as is authorized under paragraph (1) or approve a level of funding authorized under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title. If a tribal organization elects to carry out a severable portion of a contract proposal pursuant to this paragraph, subsection (b) of this section shall only apply to the portion of the contract that is declined by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedure upon refusal of request to contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary declines to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) state any objections in writing to the tribal organization,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide assistance to the tribal organization to overcome the stated objections, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide the tribal organization with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the objections raised, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, except that the tribe or tribal organization may, in lieu of filing such appeal, exercise the option to initiate an action in a Federal district court and proceed directly to such court pursuant to section 450m&ndash;1(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability insurance; waiver of defense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Beginning in 1990, the Secretary shall be responsible for obtaining or providing liability insurance or equivalent coverage, on the most cost-effective basis, for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and tribal contractors carrying out contracts, grant agreements and cooperative agreements pursuant to this subchapter. In obtaining or providing such coverage, the Secretary shall take into consideration the extent to which liability under such contracts or agreements are covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For each fiscal year during which a self-determination contract is in effect, any savings attributable to the operation of a Federal program, function, service, or activity under a self-determination contract by a tribe or tribal organization (including a cost reimbursement construction contract) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be used to provide additional services or benefits under the contract; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where a tribal organization's allowable indirect cost recoveries are below the level of indirect costs that the tribal organizations should have received for any given year pursuant to its approved indirect cost rate, and such shortfall is the result of lack of full indirect cost funding by any Federal, State, or other agency, such shortfall in recoveries shall not form the basis for any theoretical over-recovery or other adverse adjustment to any future years&rsquo; indirect cost rate or amount for such tribal organization, nor shall any agency seek to collect such shortfall from the tribal organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to fund less than the full amount of need for indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liability for indebtedness incurred before fiscal year 1992</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall not be held liable for amounts of indebtedness attributable to theoretical or actual under-recoveries or theoretical over-recoveries of indirect costs, as defined in Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;87, incurred for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 1992.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on remedies relating to cost disallowances</h4>

Such notice shall set forth the right of appeal and hearing to the board of contract appeals pursuant to section 450m&ndash;1 of this title. For the purpose of determining the 365-day period specified in this paragraph, an audit report shall be deemed to have been received on the date of actual receipt by the Secretary, if, within 60 days after receiving the report, the Secretary does not give notice of a determination by the Secretary to reject the single-agency report as insufficient due to noncompliance with chapter 75 of title 31 or noncompliance with any other applicable law. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to enlarge the rights of the Secretary with respect to section 476 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Addition to contract of full amount contractor entitled; adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the approval of a self-determination contract, the Secretary shall add to the contract the full amount of funds to which the contractor is entitled under subsection (a) of this section, subject to adjustments for each subsequent year that such tribe or tribal organization administers a Federal program, function, service, or activity under such contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Indirect costs for contracts for construction programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In calculating the indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract for a construction program, the Secretary shall take into consideration only those costs associated with the administration of the contract and shall not take into consideration those moneys actually passed on by the tribal organization to construction contractors and subcontractors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs budget consultations</h4>

In any such case, the Secretary shall provide the tribal organization with reasonable advance written notice, technical assistance (subject to available resources) to assist the tribal organization, a hearing on the record not later than 10 days after the date of such determination or such later date as the tribal organization shall approve, and promptly release any funds withheld upon subsequent compliance.</p>
