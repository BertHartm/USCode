<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) off-site using prefabricated component units for subsequent transport to the destination location; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) represents&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1638f_1_target" name="1638f_1">1</a></sup> a more economical method for provision of health care facility&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1638f_2_target" name="1638f_2">2</a></sup> than a traditionally constructed health care building.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, acting through the Service, shall establish a demonstration program under which the Secretary shall award no less than 3 grants for purchase, installation and maintenance of modular component health care facilities in Indian communities for provision of health care services.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Selection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In selecting the location of each modular component health care facility to be provided under the demonstration program, the Secretary shall give priority to projects already on the Indian Health Service facilities construction priority list and petitions which demonstrate that erection of a modular component health facility&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is more economical than construction of a traditionally constructed health care facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) can be constructed and erected on the selected location in less time than traditional construction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) can adequately house the health care services needed by the Indian population to be served.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of selection</h4>
