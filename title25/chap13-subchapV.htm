<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nontaxability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Title to lands, or any interests therein, acquired pursuant to this Act for the Spokane Tribe or individual enrolled members thereof, shall be taken in the name of the United States of America in trust for the tribe or individual Indian, and shall be nontaxable as other tribal and allotted Indian trust lands of the Spokane Reservation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Lands held by mortgage or deed of trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">That any tribal land that may be sold pursuant to this Act may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, be encumbered by a mortgage or deed of trust and shall be subject to foreclosure or sale pursuant to the terms of such a mortgage or deed of trust in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The United States shall be an indispensable party to any such proceeding with the right of removal of the clause to the United States district court for the district in which the land is located, following the procedure in section 1446 of title 28: <em>Provided</em>, That the United States shall have the right to appeal from any order of remand in the case.</p>
