<p class="statutory-body">Consistent with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.], the Secretary shall provide for the management of Indian agricultural lands to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To protect, conserve, utilize, and maintain the highest productive potential on Indian agricultural lands through the application of sound conservation practices and techniques. These practices and techniques shall be applied to planning, development, inventorying, classification, and management of agricultural resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To increase production and expand the diversity and availability of agricultural products for subsistence, income, and employment of Indians and Alaska Natives, through the development of agricultural resources on Indian lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To manage agricultural resources consistent with integrated resource management plans in order to protect and maintain other values such as wildlife, fisheries, cultural resources, recreation and to regulate water runoff and minimize soil erosion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To enable Indian farmers and ranchers to maximize the potential benefits available to them through their land by providing technical assistance, training, and education in conservation practices, management and eco<!-- PDFPage:818 -->nomics of agribusiness, sources and use of credit and marketing of agricultural products, and other applicable subject areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To develop Indian agricultural lands and associated value-added industries of Indians and Indian tribes to promote self-sustaining communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To assist trust and restricted Indian landowners in leasing their agricultural lands for a reasonable annual return, consistent with prudent management and conservation practices, and community goals as expressed in the tribal management plans and appropriate tribal ordinances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Indian agricultural resource management planning program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To meet the management objectives of this section, a 10-year Indian agriculture resource management and monitoring plan shall be developed and implemented as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Pursuant to a self-determination contract or self-governance compact, an Indian tribe may develop or implement an Indian agriculture resource plan. Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C), the tribe shall have broad discretion in designing and carrying out the planning process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a tribe chooses not to contract the development or implementation of the plan, the Secretary shall develop or implement, as appropriate, the plan in close consultation with the affected tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Whether developed directly by the tribe or by the Secretary, the plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) determine available agriculture resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) identify specific tribal agricultural resource goals and objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) establish management objectives for the resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) define critical values of the Indian tribe and its members and provide identified holistic management objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) identify actions to be taken to reach established objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) be developed through public meetings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) use the public meeting records, existing survey documents, reports, and other research from Federal agencies, tribal community colleges, and land grant universities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(viii) be completed within three years of the initiation of activity to establish the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Indian agriculture resource management plans developed and approved under this section shall govern the management and administration of Indian agricultural resources and Indian agricultural lands by the Bureau and the Indian tribal government.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Sovereign immunity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States, nor does it authorize tribal justice systems to review actions of the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within six months after December 3, 1993, the Secretary, in consultation with affected Indian tribes, shall enter into a contract with a non-Federal entity knowledgeable in agricultural management on Federal and private lands to conduct an independent assessment of Indian agricultural land management and practices.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the assessment shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to establish a comprehensive assessment of the improvement, funding, and development needs for all Indian agricultural lands;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) approve any agricultural lease or permit with (A) a tenure of up to 10 years, or (B) a tenure longer than 10 years but not to exceed 25 years unless authorized by other Federal law, when such longer tenure is determined by the Secretary to be in the best interest of the Indian landowners and when such lease or permit requires substantial investment in the development of the lands or crops by the lessee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) lease or permit agricultural lands to the highest responsible bidder at rates less than the Federal appraisal after satisfactorily advertising such lands for lease, when, in the opinion of the Secretary, such action would be in the best interest of the Indian landowner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution establishing a general policy for leasing of Indian agricultural lands, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall provide a preference to Indian operators in the issuance and renewal of agricultural leases and permits so long as the lessor receives fair market value for his property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall waive or modify the requirement that a lessee post a surety or performance bond on agricultural leases and permits issued by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall provide for posting of other collateral or security in lieu of surety or other bonds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) when such tribal resolution sets forth a tribal definition of what constitutes &ldquo;highly fractionated undivided heirship lands&rdquo; and adopts an alternative plan for providing notice to owners, may waive or modify any general notice requirement of Federal law and proceed to negotiate and lease or permit such highly fractionated undivided interest heirship lands in conformity with tribal law in order to prevent waste, reduce idle land acreage, and ensure income; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) shall approve leases and permits of tribally owned agricultural lands at rates determined by the tribal governing body.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rights of individual landowners</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or altering the authority or right of an individual allottee or Indian tribe in the legal or beneficial use of his, her, or its own land <!-- PDFPage:820 -->or to enter into an agricultural lease of the surface interest of his, her, or its allotment or land under any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The owners of a majority interest in any trust or restricted land are authorized to enter into an agricultural lease of the surface interest of a trust or restricted allotment, and such lease shall be binding upon the owners of the minority interests in such land if the terms of the lease provide such minority interests with not less than fair market value for such land.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), a majority interest in trust or restricted land is an interest greater than 50 percent of the legal or beneficial title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to a parcel of trust or restricted land if the owners of at least 50 percent of the legal or beneficial interest in such land file with the Secretary a written objection to the application of all or any part of such tribal rules to the leasing of such parcel of land.</p>
