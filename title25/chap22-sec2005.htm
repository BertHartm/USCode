<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">By January 1, 1996, and at each time thereafter that the annual budget request for Bureau educational services is presented, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a detailed plan to bring such facilities into compliance with such standards. Such plan shall include detailed information on the status of each facility's compliance with such standards, specific cost estimates for meeting such standards at each school, and specific time lines for bringing each school into compliance with such standards.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Hazardous conditions at Bureau schools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A Bureau school may be closed or consolidated, and the programs of a Bureau school may be substantially curtailed, by reason of plant conditions that constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety only if a health and safety officer of the Bureau determines that such conditions exist at the Bureau school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In making determinations described in paragraph (1) before July 1, 1989, health and safety officers of the Bureau shall use the health and safety guidelines of the Bureau that were in effect on January 1, 1988.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">an inspection of the condition of such plant shall be conducted by an appropriate tribal, county, municipal, or State health and safety officer to determine whether conditions at such plant constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety. Such inspection shall be completed by not later than the date that is 30 days after the date on which the action described in paragraph (1) is taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The inspection required under clause (i) shall be conducted by a health and safety officer designated jointly by the Secretary and the tribes affected by the action described in paragraph (1). If the Secretary and such tribes are unable to agree on the designation of the health and safety officer, the Secretary shall designate the health and safety officer and shall provide notice of such designation to each of such tribes before the inspection is conducted by such officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the health and safety officer conducting an inspection of a plant required under clause (i) determines that conditions at the plant do not constitute an immediate hazard to health and <!-- PDFPage:576 -->safety, any consolidation or curtailment that was made by reason of conditions at the plant shall immediately cease and any school closed by reason of conditions at the plant shall be reopened immediately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a Bureau school is temporarily closed or consolidated, or the programs of a Bureau school are substantially curtailed, by reason of plant conditions that constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary estimates that the closure, consolidation, or curtailment will be more than 1 year in duration,</p>
