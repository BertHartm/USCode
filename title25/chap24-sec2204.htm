<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any Indian tribe may purchase at no less than the fair market value part or all of the interests in any tract of trust or restricted land within that tribe's reservation or otherwise subject to that tribe's jurisdiction with the consent of the owners of such interests. The tribe may purchase all of the interests in such tract with the consent of the owners of undivided interests equal to at least 50 percent of the undivided interest in such tract. Interests owned by an Indian tribe in a tract may be included in the computation of the percentage of ownership of the undivided interests in that tract for purposes of determining whether the consent requirement under the preceding sentence has been met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions applicable to purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) of this section applies on the condition that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any Indian owning any undivided interest, and in actual use and possession of such tract for at least three years preceding the tribal initiative, may purchase such tract by matching the tribal offer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if at any time within five years following the date of acquisition of such land by an individual pursuant to this section, such property is offered for sale or a petition is filed with the Secretary for removal of the property from trust or restricted status, the tribe shall have 180 days from the date it is notified of such offer or petition to acquire such property by paying to the owner the fair market value as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the approval of the Secretary shall be required for a land sale initiated under this section, except that such approval shall not be required with respect to a land sale transaction initiated by an Indian tribe that has in effect a land consolidation plan that has been approved by the Secretary under section 2203 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall be applicable only to parcels of land (including surface and subsurface interests, except with respect to a subsurface interest that has been severed from the surface interest, in which case this subsection shall apply only to the surface interest) which the Secretary has determined, pursuant to paragraph (2)(B),<sup><a href="#2204_2_target" name="2204_2">2</a></sup> to be parcels of highly fractionated Indian land.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each partition action under this subsection shall be conducted by the Secretary in accordance with the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon receipt of any payment or bond required under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall commence a process for partitioning a parcel of land by sale in accordance with the provisions of this subsection upon receipt of an application by&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Costs of serving notice and publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The costs of serving and publishing notice under subparagraph (F) shall be borne by the applicant. Upon receiving written notice from the Secretary, the applicant must pay to the Secretary an amount determined by the Secretary to be the estimated costs of such service of notice and publication, or furnish a sufficient bond for such estimated costs within the time stated in the notice, failing which, unless an extension is granted by the Secretary, the Secretary shall not be required to commence the partition process under subparagraph (A) and may deny the application. The Secretary shall have the discretion and authority in any case to waive either the payment or the bond (or any portion of such payment or bond) otherwise required by this subparagraph, upon making a determination that such waiver will further the policies of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon receipt of an application pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall deter<!-- PDFPage:651 -->mine whether the subject parcel meets the requirements set forth in section 2201(6) of this title to be classified as a parcel of highly fractionated Indian land.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Consent requirements</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Any consent required by this clause must be in writing and acknowledged before a notary public (or other official authorized to make acknowledgments), and shall be approved by Secretary unless the Secretary has reason to believe that the consent was obtained as a result of fraud or undue influence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a partition is approved under this subsection and an owner of an interest in the parcel of land refuses to surrender possession in accordance with the partition decision, or refuses to execute any conveyance necessary to implement the partition, then any affected owner or the United States may&mdash;</p>
