<p class="statutory-body">The funds apportioned to the Northwestern Band of Shoshone Indians, less attorney's fees, and expenses due the attorneys representing the Northwestern Band under an approved contract, effective March 1, 1968, shall be placed to its credit in the United States Treasury and shall be distributed equally to the members whose names appear on the final roll and in accordance with the provisions of sections 581 to 590 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The per capita shares shall be determined on the basis of the number of persons listed on the proposed roll published as hereinbefore provided and the number of persons on whose behalf an appeal has been taken to the Secretary contesting omission from such proposed roll. The share of those persons excluded from the final roll by reason of the decision of the Secretary on appeal shall be distributed equally to the persons included on the final roll.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall distribute a share payable to a living enrollee directly to such enrollee. The per capita share of a deceased enrollee shall be paid to his heirs or legatees upon proof of death and inheritance satisfactory to the Secretary, whose findings upon such proof shall be final and conclusive. A share or interest therein payable to enrollees or their heirs or legatees who are less than twenty-one years of age or who are under legal disability shall be paid in accordance with such procedures, including the establishment of trusts, as the Secretary determines appropriate to protect the best interest of such persons.</p>
