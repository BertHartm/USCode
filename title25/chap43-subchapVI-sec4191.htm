<p class="statutory-body">Notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations, have such maturities, and be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary. The Secretary may not deny a guarantee under this subchapter on the basis of the proposed repayment period for the note or other obligation, unless the period is more than 20 years or the Secretary determines that the period causes the guarantee to constitute an unacceptable financial risk.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on outstanding guarantees</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A guarantee made under this subchapter shall guarantee repayment of 95 percent of the unpaid principal and interest due on the notes or other obligations guaranteed.</p>
