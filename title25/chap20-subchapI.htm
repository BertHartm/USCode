<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year pursuant to section 1810(a)(2) of this title for grants under section 1807 of this title are not sufficient to pay in full the total amount which approved applicants are eligible to receive under such section for such fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary shall first allocate to each such applicant which received funds under section 1807 of this title for the preceding fiscal year an amount equal to 95 percent of the payment received by such applicant under section 1808 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary shall next allocate to applicants who did not receive funds under such section for the preceding fiscal year an amount equal to 100 per centum of the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the per capita payment for the preceding fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the applicant's projected Indian student count for the academic year for which payment is being made;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in the order in which such applicants have qualified for assistance in accordance with such section so that no amount shall be allocated to a later qualified applicant until each earlier qualified applicant is allocated an amount equal to such product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if additional funds remain after making the allocations required by subparagraphs (A) and (B), the Secretary shall allocate such funds by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) ratably increasing the amounts of the grants determined under subparagraph (A) until such grants are equal to 100 per centum of the product described in such subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) then ratably increasing the amounts of both (I) the grants determined under subparagraph (A), as increased under clause (i) of this subparagraph, and (II) the grants determined under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;per capita payment&rdquo; for any fiscal year shall be determined by dividing the amount available for grants to tribally controlled colleges or universities under section 1807 of this title for such fiscal year by the sum of the Indian student counts of such colleges or universities for such fiscal year. The Secretary shall, on the basis of the most satisfactory data available, compute the Indian student count for any fiscal year for which such count was not used for the purpose of making allocations under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ratable reduction or increase in funds available for existing schools; excess funds; definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for grants under section 1807 of this title are not sufficient to pay in full the total amount of the grants determined pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, the amount which applicants described in such subsection are eligible to receive under section 1807 of this title for such fiscal year shall be ratably reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any additional funds become available for making payments under section 1807 of this title for any fiscal year to which subsection (a) of this section or paragraph (1) of this subsection applies, such additional amounts shall be allocated by first increasing grants reduced under paragraph (1) of this subsection on the same basis as they were reduced and by then allocating the remainder in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. Sums appropriated in excess of the amount necessary to pay in full the total amounts for which applicants are eligible under section 1807 of this title shall be allocated by ratably increasing such total amounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) References in this subsection and subsection (a) of this section to section 1807 of this title shall, with respect to fiscal year 1983, be deemed to refer to section 1806 of this title as in effect at the beginning of such fiscal year.</p>

The amounts so reported by any grant recipient shall be made available for reallocation to eligible grantees on a basis proportionate to the amount which is unfunded as a result of the ratable reduction, but no grant recipient shall receive, as a result of such reallocation, more than the amount provided for under section 1807(a) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any tribally controlled college or university for which the report of the Secretary under section 1812(a) of this title identifies a need for new construction, the Secretary shall, subject to appropriations and on the basis of an application submitted in accordance with such requirements as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation, provide grants for such construction in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to be eligible for a grant under this section, a tribally controlled college or university&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) must be a current recipient of grants under section 1805 or 1807 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) must be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency listed by the Secretary of Education pursuant to the last sentence of section 1001 of title 20, except that such requirement may be waived if the Secretary determines that there is a reasonable expectation that such college or university will be fully accredited within eighteen months. In any case where such a waiver is granted, grants under this section shall be available only for planning and development of proposals for construction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maximum amount of grant; waiver of restriction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), grants for construction under this section shall not exceed 80 per centum of the cost of such construction, except that no tribally controlled college or university shall be required to expend more than $400,000 in fulfillment of the remaining 20 per centum. For the purpose of providing its required portion of the cost of such construction, a tribally controlled college or university may use funds provided under section 13 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, the requirements of paragraph (1) in the case of any tribally controlled college or university which demonstrates that neither such college or university nor the tribal government with which it is affiliated have sufficient resources to comply with such requirements. The Secretary shall base a decision on whether to grant such a waiver solely on the basis of the following factors: (A) tribal population; (B) potential student population; (C) the rate of unemployment among tribal members; (D) tribal financial resources; and (E) other factors alleged by the college or university to have a bearing on the availability of resources for compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) and which may include the educational attainment of tribal members.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Failure to use facility in approved manner; title to vest in United States; settlement</h4>
