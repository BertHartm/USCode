<p class="statutory-body">By no later than the date that is 180 days after the date on which a management contract is submitted to the Chairman for approval, the <!-- PDFPage:707 -->Chairman shall approve or disapprove such contract on its merits. The Chairman may extend the 180-day period by not more than 90 days if the Chairman notifies the Indian tribe in writing of the reason for the extension.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) has been determined to be a person whose prior activities, criminal record if any, or reputation, habits, and associations pose a threat to the public interest or to the effective regulation and control of gaming, or create or enhance the dangers of unsuitable, unfair, or illegal practices, methods, and activities in the conduct of gaming or the carrying on of the business and financial arrangements incidental thereto;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
