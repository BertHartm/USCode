<p class="statutory-body">Within ninety days after August 13, 1954, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register (1) a list of those tribes for which membership rolls will be required for the purposes of this subchapter, and (2) a list of those tribes for which no membership rolls will be required for the purposes of this subchapter. Each tribe on each list shall have a period of six months from the date of publication of the notice in which to prepare and submit to the Secretary a proposed roll of the members of the tribe living on August 13, 1954, which shall be published in the Federal Register. In the absence of applicable law, or eligibility requirements in an approved constitution, bylaws, or membership ordinance, eligibility for enrollment shall be determined under such rules and regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. No person shall be enrolled on more than one tribal roll prepared pursuant to this subchapter. If a tribe on list one fails to submit such roll within the time specified in this section, the Secretary shall prepare a proposed roll for the tribe, which shall be published in the Federal Register. Any person claiming membership rights in the tribe or an interest in its assets, or a representative of the Secretary on behalf of any such person, may, within ninety days from the date of publication of the proposed roll, file an appeal with the Secretary contesting the inclusion or omission of the name of any person on or from such roll. The Secretary shall review such appeals and his decisions thereon shall be final and conclusive. After disposition of all such appeals the roll of the tribe shall be published in the Federal Register and such roll shall be final for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
