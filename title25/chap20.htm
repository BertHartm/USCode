The Secretary shall, on the basis of the most satisfactory data available, compute the Indian student count for any fiscal year for which such count was not used for the purpose of making allocations under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ratable reduction or increase in funds available for existing schools; excess funds; definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for grants under section 1807 of this title are not sufficient to pay in full the total amount of the grants determined pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, the amount which applicants described in such subsection are eligible to receive under section 1807 of this title for such fiscal year shall be ratably reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any additional funds become available for making payments under section 1807 of this <!-- PDFPage:555 -->title for any fiscal year to which subsection (a) of this section or paragraph (1) of this subsection applies, such additional amounts shall be allocated by first increasing grants reduced under paragraph (1) of this subsection on the same basis as they were reduced and by then allocating the remainder in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. Sums appropriated in excess of the amount necessary to pay in full the total amounts for which applicants are eligible under section 1807 of this title shall be allocated by ratably increasing such total amounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) References in this subsection and subsection (a) of this section to section 1807 of this title shall, with respect to fiscal year 1983, be deemed to refer to section 1806 of this title as in effect at the beginning of such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallocation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any fiscal year in which the amounts for which grant recipients are eligible to receive have been reduced under the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section, and in which additional funds have not been made available to pay in full the total of such amounts under the second sentence of such subsection, each grantee shall report to the Secretary any unused portion of received funds ninety days prior to the grant expiration date. The amounts so reported by any grant recipient shall be made available for reallocation to eligible grantees on a basis proportionate to the amount which is unfunded as a result of the ratable reduction, but no grant recipient shall receive, as a result of such reallocation, more than the amount provided for under section 1807(a) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any tribally controlled community college for which the report of the Secretary under section 1812(a) of this title identifies a need for new construction, the Secretary shall, subject to appropriations and on the basis of an application submitted in accordance with such requirements as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation, provide grants for such construction in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to be eligible for a grant under this section, a tribally controlled community college&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) must be a current recipient of grants under section 1805 or 1807 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) must be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency listed by the Secretary of Education pursuant to the last sentence of section 1141(a) of title 20, except that such requirement may be waived if the Secretary determines that there is a reasonable expectation that such college will be fully accredited within eighteen months. In any case where such a waiver is granted, grants under this section shall be available only for planning and development of proposals for construction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maximum amount of grant; waiver of restriction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), grants for construction under this section shall not exceed 80 per centum of the cost of such construction, except that no tribally controlled community college shall be required to expend more than $400,000 in fulfillment of the remaining 20 per centum. For the purpose of providing its required portion of the cost of such construction, a tribally controlled community college may use funds provided under section 13 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, the requirements of paragraph (1) in the case of any tribally controlled community college which demonstrates that neither such college nor the tribal government with which it is affiliated have sufficient resources to comply with such requirements. The Secretary shall base a decision on whether to grant such a waiver solely on the basis of the following factors: (A) tribal population; (B) potential student population; (C) the rate of unemployment among tribal members; (D) tribal financial resources; and (E) other factors alleged by the college to have a bearing on the availability of resources for compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) and which may include the educational attainment of tribal members.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Failure to use facility in approved manner; title to vest in United States; settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, within twenty years after completion of construction of a facility which has been constructed in whole or in part with a grant made available under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the facility ceases to be used by the applicant in a public or nonprofit capacity as an academic facility, unless the Secretary determines that there is good cause for releasing the institution from this obligation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the tribe with which the applicant is affiliated fails to use the facility for a public purpose approved by the tribal government in furtherance of the general welfare of the community served by the tribal government,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">title to the facility shall vest in the United States and the applicant (or such tribe if such tribe is the successor in title to the facility) shall be entitled to recover from the United States an amount which bears the same ratio to the present value of the facility as the amount of the applicant's contribution (excluding any funds provided under section 13 of this title) bore to the original cost of the facility. Such value shall be determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in the United States district court for the district in which such facility is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Religious use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No construction assisted with funds under this section shall be used for religious worship or a sectarian activity or for a school or department of divinity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;construction&rdquo; includes reconstruction or renovation (as such terms are defined in the first sentence of subparagraph (B) of section 1132e&ndash;1(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1813_1_target" name="1813_1">1</a></sup> of title 20); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) From the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1836 of this title, the Secretary shall establish a program of making endowment grants to tribally controlled community colleges which are current recipients of assistance under section 1807 of this title or under section 640b of this title. No such college shall be ineligible for such a grant for a fiscal year by reason of the receipt of such a grant for a preceding fiscal year, but no such college shall be eligible for such a grant for a fiscal year if such college has been awarded a grant under section 1065 of title 20 for such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No grant for the establishment of an endowment fund by a tribally controlled community college shall be made unless such college enters into an agreement with the Secretary which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides for the investment and maintenance of a trust fund, the corpus and earnings <!-- PDFPage:558 -->of which shall be invested in the same manner as funds are invested under paragraph (2) of section 1065(c) of title 20, except that for purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;trust fund&rdquo; means a fund established by an institution of higher education or by a foundation that is exempt from taxation and is maintained for the purpose of generating income for the support of the institution, and may include real estate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides for the deposit in such trust fund of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any Federal capital contributions made from funds appropriated under section 1836 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a capital contribution by such college in an amount (or of a value) equal to half of the amount of each Federal capital contribution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any earnings of the funds so deposited;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provides that such funds will be deposited in such a manner as to insure the accumulation of interest thereon at a rate not less than that generally available for similar funds deposited at the banking or savings institution for the same period or periods of time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provides that, if at any time such college withdraws any capital contribution made by that college, an amount of Federal capital contribution equal to twice the amount of (or value of) such withdrawal shall be withdrawn and returned to the Secretary for reallocation to other colleges;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provides that no part of the net earnings of such trust fund will inure to the benefit of any private person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) includes such other provisions as may be necessary to protect the financial interest of the United States and promote the purpose of this subchapter and as are agreed to by the Secretary and the college, including a description of recordkeeping procedures for the expenditure of accumulated interest which will allow the Secretary to audit and monitor programs and activities conducted with such interest.</p>
