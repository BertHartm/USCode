<p class="statutory-body">Recognizing the special relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes and their members and the Federal responsibility to Indian people, the Congress finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that clause 3, section 8, article I of the United States Constitution provides that &ldquo;The Congress shall have Power *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* To regulate Commerce *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* with Indian tribes&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1901_1_target" name="1901_1">1</a></sup>&rdquo; and, through this and other constitutional authority, Congress has plenary power over Indian affairs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and their resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and that the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an Indian tribe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that the States, exercising their recognized jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings through administrative and judicial bodies, have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families.</p>

The court may, in its discretion, appoint counsel for the child upon a finding that such appointment is in the best interest of the child. Where State law makes no provision for appointment of counsel in such proceedings, the court shall promptly notify the Secretary upon appointment of counsel, and the Secretary, upon certification of the presiding judge, shall pay reasonable fees and expenses out of funds which may be appropriated pursuant to section 13 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Examination of reports or other documents</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Adoptive placements; preferences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the child's extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child's tribe; or (3) other Indian families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foster care or preadoptive placements; criteria; preferences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any child accepted for foster care or preadoptive placement shall be placed in the least restrictive setting which most approximates a family and in which his special needs, if any, may be met. The child shall also be placed within reasonable proximity to his or her home, taking into account any special needs of the child. In any foster care or preadoptive placement, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tribal resolution for different order of preference; personal preference considered; anonymity in application of preferences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a placement under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, if the Indian child's tribe shall establish a different order of preference by resolution, the agency or court effecting the placement shall follow such order so long as the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child, as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Where appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or parent shall be considered: <em>Provided</em>, That where a consenting parent evidences a desire for anonymity, the court or agency shall give weight to such desire in applying the preferences.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Social and cultural standards applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of this section shall be the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family resides or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Record of placement; availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A record of each such placement, under State law, of an Indian child shall be maintained by the State in which the placement was made, evidencing the efforts to comply with the order of preference specified in this section.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition; suitable plan; approval by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Indian tribe which became subject to State jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the Act of August 15, 1953 (67 Stat. 588), as amended by title IV of the Act of April 11, 1968 (82 Stat. 73, 78), or pursuant to any other Federal law, may reassume jurisdiction over child <!-- PDFPage:607 -->custody proceedings. Before any Indian tribe may reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings, such tribe shall present to the Secretary for approval a petition to reassume such jurisdiction which includes a suitable plan to exercise such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria applicable to consideration by Secretary; partial retrocession</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In considering the petition and feasibility of the plan of a tribe under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may consider, among other things:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) whether or not the tribe maintains a membership roll or alternative provision for clearly identifying the persons who will be affected by the reassumption of jurisdiction by the tribe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the size of the reservation or former reservation area which will be affected by retrocession and reassumption of jurisdiction by the tribe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the population base of the tribe, or distribution of the population in homogeneous communities or geographic areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the feasibility of the plan in cases of multitribal occupation of a single reservation or geographic area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In those cases where the Secretary determines that the jurisdictional provisions of section 1911(a) of this title are not feasible, he is authorized to accept partial retrocession which will enable tribes to exercise referral jurisdiction as provided in section 1911(b) of this title, or, where appropriate, will allow them to exercise exclusive jurisdiction as provided in section 1911(a) of this title over limited community or geographic areas without regard for the reservation status of the area affected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval of petition; publication in Federal Register; notice; reassumption period; correction of causes for disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary approves any petition under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall publish notice of such approval in the Federal Register and shall notify the affected State or States of such approval. The Indian tribe concerned shall reassume jurisdiction sixty days after publication in the Federal Register of notice of approval. If the Secretary disapproves any petition under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide such technical assistance as may be necessary to enable the tribe to correct any deficiency which the Secretary identified as a cause for disapproval.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Pending actions or proceedings unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assumption of jurisdiction under this section shall not affect any action or proceeding over which a court has already assumed jurisdiction, except as may be provided pursuant to any agreement under section 1919 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Statement of purpose; scope of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to make grants to Indian tribes and organizations in the establishment and operation of Indian child and family service programs on or near reservations and in the preparation and implementation of child welfare codes. The objective of every Indian child and family service program shall be to prevent the breakup of Indian families and, in particular, to insure that the permanent removal of an Indian child from the custody of his parent or Indian custodian shall be a last resort. Such child and family service programs may include, but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a system for licensing or otherwise regulating Indian foster and adoptive homes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the operation and maintenance of facilities for the counseling and treatment of Indian families and for the temporary custody of Indian children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) family assistance, including homemaker and home counselors, day care, afterschool care, and employment, recreational activities, and respite care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) home improvement programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the employment of professional and other trained personnel to assist the tribal court in the disposition of domestic relations and child welfare matters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) education and training of Indians, including tribal court judges and staff, in skills relating to child and family assistance and service programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a subsidy program under which Indian adoptive children may be provided support comparable to that for which they would be eligible as foster children, taking into account the appropriate State standards of support for maintenance and medical needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) guidance, legal representation, and advice to Indian families involved in tribal, State, or Federal child custody proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Non-Federal matching funds for related Social Security or other Federal financial assistance programs; assistance for such programs unaffected; State licensing or approval for qualification for assistance under federally assisted program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds appropriated for use by the Secretary in accordance with this section may be utilized as non-Federal matching share in connection with funds provided under titles IV&ndash;B and XX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 620 et seq., 1397 et seq.] or under any other Federal financial assistance programs which contribute to the purpose for which such funds are authorized to be appropriated for use under this chapter. The provision or possibility of assistance under this chapter shall not be a basis for the denial or reduction of any assistance otherwise authorized under titles IV&ndash;B and XX of the Social Security Act or any other federally assisted program. For purposes of qualifying for assistance under a federally assisted program, licensing or approval of foster or adoptive homes or institutions by an Indian tribe shall be deemed equivalent to licensing or approval by a State.</p>
