<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) many risk behaviors and contributing factors for suicide are more prevalent in Indian country than in other areas, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) suicide clustering in Indian country affects entire tribal communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) death rates for Indians and Alaska Natives are statistically underestimated because many areas of Indian country lack the proper resources to identify and monitor the presence of disease;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 1/3 of health needs in Indian country relate to mental health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) often, the lack of resources of Indian tribes and the remote nature of Indian reservations make it difficult to meet the requirements necessary to access Federal assistance, including grants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Service have established specific initiatives to combat youth suicide in Indian country and among Indians and Alaska Natives throughout the United States, including the National Suicide Prevention Initiative of the Service, which has worked with Service, tribal, and urban Indian health programs since 2003;</p>
