<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings respecting historical and special legal relationship, and resultant responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, after careful review of the Federal Government's historical and special legal relationship with, and resulting responsibilities to, American Indian people, finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the prolonged Federal domination of Indian service programs has served to retard rather than enhance the progress of Indian people and their communities by depriving Indians of the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of self-government, and has denied to the Indian people an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians which are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Indian people will never surrender their desire to control their relationships both among themselves and with non-Indian governments, organizations, and persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process which will insure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Federal responsibility for and assistance to education of Indian children has not effected the desired level of educational achievement or created the diverse opportunities and personal satisfaction which education can and should provide; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) parental and community control of the educational process is of crucial importance to the Indian people.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Government-to-Government Relations With Native American Tribal Governments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 29, 1994, 59 F.R. 22951, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States Government has a unique legal relationship with Native American tribal governments as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, and court decisions. As executive departments and agencies undertake activities affecting Native American tribal rights or trust resources, such activities should be implemented in a knowledgeable, sensitive manner respectful of tribal sovereignty. Today, as part of an historic meeting, I am outlining principles that executive departments and agencies, including every component bureau and office, are to follow in their interactions with Native American tribal governments. The purpose of these principles is to clarify our responsibility to ensure that the Federal Government operates within a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized Native American tribes. I am strongly committed to building a more effective day-to-day working relationship reflecting respect for the rights of self-government due the sovereign tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to ensure that the rights of sovereign tribal governments are fully respected, executive branch activities shall be guided by the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The head of each executive department and agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the department or agency operates within a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each executive department and agency shall consult, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, with tribal governments prior to taking actions that affect federally recognized tribal governments. All such consultations are to be open and candid so that all interested parties may evaluate for themselves the potential impact of relevant proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Each executive department and agency shall assess the impact of Federal Government plans, projects, programs, and activities on tribal trust resources and assure that tribal government rights and concerns are considered during the development of such plans, projects, programs, and activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Each executive department and agency shall take appropriate steps to remove any procedural impediments to working directly and effectively with tribal governments on activities that affect the trust property and/or governmental rights of the tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Each executive department and agency shall work cooperatively with other Federal departments and agencies to enlist their interest and support in cooperative efforts, where appropriate, to accomplish the goals of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Each executive department and agency shall apply the requirements of Executive Orders Nos. 12875 (&ldquo;Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership&rdquo;) and 12866 (&ldquo;Regulatory Planning and Review&rdquo;) [5 U.S.C. 601 notes] to design solutions and tailor Federal programs, in appropriate circumstances, to address specific or unique needs of tribal communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department and agency shall ensure that the department or agency's bureaus and components are fully aware of this memorandum, through publication or other means, and that they are in compliance with its requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right to administrative or judicial review, or any other right or <!-- PDFPage:145 -->benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
