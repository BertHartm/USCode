<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and declarations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Maliseet Tribe are asserting claims for possession of lands within the State of Maine and for damages on the ground that the lands in question were originally transferred in violation of law, including, but without limitation, the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 137), or subsequent reenactments or versions thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Indians, Indian nations, and tribes and bands of Indians, other than the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, that once may have held aboriginal title to lands within the State of Maine long ago abandoned their aboriginal holdings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Penobscot Nation, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Penobscot Nation's Governor and Council, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Penobscot Nation which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Passamaquoddy Tribe, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Passamaquoddy Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Houlton Band Council, is the sole successor in interest, as to lands within the United States, to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Maliseet Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Substantial economic and social hardship to a large number of landowners, citizens, and communities in the State of Maine, and therefore to the economy of the State of Maine as a whole, will result if the aforementioned claims are not resolved promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) This subchapter represents a good faith effort on the part of Congress to provide the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians with a fair and just settlement of their land claims. In the absence of congressional action, these land claims would be pursued through the courts, a process which in all likelihood would consume many years and thereby promote hostility and uncertainty in the State of Maine to the ultimate detriment of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, their members, and all other citizens of the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The State of Maine, with the agreement of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, has enacted legislation defining the relationship between the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and their members, and the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Since 1820, the State of Maine has provided special services to the Indians residing within its borders, including the members of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians. During this same period, the United States provided few special services to the respective tribe, nation, or band, and repeatedly denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for the said tribe, nation, and band. In view of this provision of special services by the State of Maine, requiring substantial expenditures by the State of Maine and made by the State of Maine without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Maine not be required further to contribute directly to this claims settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to remove the cloud on the titles to land in the State of Maine resulting from Indian claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to clarify the status of other land and natural resources in the State of Maine;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ratify the Maine Implementing Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine and the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the Penobscot Nation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to confirm that all other Indians, Indian nations and tribes and bands of Indians now or hereafter existing or recognized in the State of Maine are and shall be subject to all laws of the State of Maine, as provided herein.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings and Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Aroostook Band of Micmacs, as represented as of the time of passage of this Act by the Aroostook Micmac Council, is the sole successor in interest, as to lands within the United States, to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Micmac Nation which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Band was not referred to in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 [25 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.] because historical documentation of the Micmac presence in Maine was not available at that time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) This documentation does establish the historical presence of Micmacs in Maine and the existence of aboriginal lands in Maine jointly used by the Micmacs and other tribes to which the Micmacs could have asserted aboriginal title but for the extinguishment of all such claims by the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Aroostook Band of Micmacs, in both its history and its presence in Maine, is similar to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and would have received similar treatment under the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 if the information available today had been available to Congress and the parties at that time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) It is now fair and just to afford the Aroostook Band of Micmacs the same settlement provided to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for the settlement of that Band's claims, to the extent they would have benefited from inclusion in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Since 1820, the State of Maine has provided special services to the Indians residing within its borders, including the members of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs. During this same period, the United States provided few special services to the Band and repeatedly denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for the Indian groups in Maine. In view of this provision of special services by the State of Maine, requiring substantial expenditures by the State of Maine and made by the State of Maine without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Maine not be required further to contribute directly to this settlement.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this Act to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) provide Federal recognition of the Band;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) provide to the members of the Band the services which the United States provides to Indians because of their status as Indians; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) place $900,000 in a land acquisition fund and property tax fund for the future use of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) ratify the Micmac Settlement Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) there is pending before the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut a civil action entitled &ldquo;Western Pequot Tribe of Indians against Holdridge Enterprises Incorporated, et al., Civil Action Numbered H76&ndash;193 (D. Conn.),&rdquo; which involves Indian claims to certain public and private lands within the town of Ledyard, Connecticut;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) the pendency of this lawsuit has placed a cloud on the titles to much of the land in the town of Ledyard, including lands not involved in the lawsuit, which has resulted in severe economic hardships for the residents of the town;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) the Congress shares with the State of Connecticut and the parties to the lawsuit a desire to remove all clouds on titles resulting from such Indian land claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) the parties to the lawsuit and others interested in the settlement of Indian land claims within the State of Connecticut have reached an agreement which requires implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States and the Legislature of the State of Connecticut;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) the Western Pequot Tribe, as represented as of October 18, 1983, by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Western Pequot Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Connecticut; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(f) the State of Connecticut is contributing twenty acres of land owned by the State of Connecticut to fulfill this subchapter. The State of Connecticut will construct and repair three sections of paved or gravel roadways within the reservation of the Tribe. The State of Connecticut has provided special services to the members of the Western Pequot Tribe residing within its borders. The United States has provided few, if any, special services to the Western Pequot Tribe and has denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for said Tribe. In view of the provision of land by the State of Connecticut, the provision of paved roadways by the State of Connecticut, and the provision of special services by the State of Connecticut without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Connecticut not be required to otherwise contribute directly to this claims settlement.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Expenditure of Fund; private settlement lands; economic development plan; acquisition of land and natural resources</h4>

Subsequent to January 1, 1985, the Secretary shall determine whether and to what extent an amount less than $600,000 has been expended to acquire private settlement lands and shall make that amount available to the Tribe to be used in accordance with the economic development plan approved pursuant to paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall disburse all or part of the Fund together with any and all income accruing to such Fund (excepting the amount reserved in paragraph (2)) according to a plan to promote the economic development of the Tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Tribe shall submit an economic development plan to the Secretary and the Secretary shall approve such plan within sixty days of its submission if he finds that it is reasonably related to the economic development of the Tribe. If the Secretary does not approve such plan, he shall, at the time of his decision, set forth in writing and with particularity, the reasons for his disapproval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may not agree to terms which provide for the investment of the Fund in a manner inconsistent with section 162a of this title, unless the Tribe first submits a specific waiver of liability on the part of the United States for any loss which may result from such an investment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Tribe may, with the approval of the Secretary, alter the economic development plan subject to the conditions set forth in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Under no circumstances shall any part of the Fund be distributed to any member of the Tribe unless pursuant to the economic development plan approved by the Secretary under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As the Fund or any portion thereof is disbursed by the Secretary in accordance with this section, the United States shall have no further trust responsibility to the Tribe or its members with respect to the sums paid, any subsequent expenditures of these sums, or any property other than private settlement lands or services purchased with these sums.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Until the Tribe has submitted and the Secretary has approved the terms of the use of the Fund, the Secretary shall fix the terms for the administration of the portion of the Fund as to which there is no agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(9) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 3113 and 3114(a) to (d) of title 40, the Secretary may acquire land or natural resources under this section from the ostensible owner of the land or natural resources only if the Secretary and the ostensible owner of the land or natural resources have agreed upon the identity of the land or natural resources to be sold and upon the purchase price and other terms of sale. Subject to the agreement required by the preceding sentence, the Secretary may institute condemnation proceedings in order to perfect title, satisfactory to the Attorney General, in the United States and condemn interests adverse to the ostensible owner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is pending before the United States District Court for the southern district of Florida a lawsuit by the Seminole Tribe which involves certain lands within the State and there are also claims by the tribe to other areas of Florida by virtue of an 1839 Executive order of the President and by right of non-extinguishment of aboriginal possession which has been asserted but not filed in court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the pendency of this lawsuit and these claims may result in economic hardships for residents of the State by clouding the titles to lands in the State, including lands not now involved in the lawsuit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the pendency of this lawsuit and these claims also have clouded the easement rights of the South Florida Water Management District in lands necessary for use as a water flowage and storage area, which is part of a federally authorized project for flood control and water management in central and southern Florida, and which is being used to provide and regulate a water supply for the residents of south Florida;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the State, the district, and the tribe have executed agreements for the purposes of resolving tribal land claims and settling the lawsuit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which include conveyance of land and payment of consideration to the tribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which require implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States and the Legislature of the State of Florida;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Congress shares with the parties to such agreements a desire to settle these Indian claims in the State of Florida without additional cost to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the water rights of the tribe, and that continued controversy over this should be settled by agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the State, the district, and the tribe have entered into a compact which, if approved by Congress and the Florida Legislature, creates specifically defined water rights in lieu of the undefined water rights claimed by the tribe.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Survey of Seminole Federal Reservations in Florida</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on December 31, 1987, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) conduct a cadastral survey of those portions of the Seminole Federal Reservations in Florida not previously surveyed by the Department of the Interior, including all lands taken into trust as reservations under the authority of this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publish the correct legal descriptions of the Seminole Reservations in the Federal Register within 180 days after the survey is completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acceptance of land in future by Secretary in trust for Seminole Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Settlement Agreement, there is a subsequent agreement between the tribe, the State, and the district providing that lands exchanged with the tribe or acquired by the tribe may be taken into Federal trust as a reservation for the tribe, the Secretary shall accept the transfer of such lands to the United States, to be held in trust for the use and benefit of the tribe pursuant to the terms and conditions of the subsequent agreement unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total amount of land previously taken in trust under this subsection exceeds the amount of land transferred to the State and Water District by the tribe under the Settlement Agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines in writing that either the size, location, or condition of the land, or the terms and conditions under which it is transferred would place an unreasonable burden on the United States as trustee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the land is not in Florida; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the land is not agricultural in nature.</p>

The laws of Florida relating to alcoholic beverages, gambling, sale of cigarettes, and their successor laws, shall have the same force and effect within said transferred lands as they have elsewhere within the State. The State, with respect to the transferred lands, shall also have jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians under said laws to the same extent the State has jurisdiction over said offenses committed elsewhere within the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as permitting the exercise of the above jurisdiction by the State regarding matters to which section 1162(b) of title 18 and section 1360(b) of title 28 apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The scope of tribal sovereignty over transferred lands, with the specific exceptions of law relating to cigarettes, gambling and alcohol described in this subsection, shall be as required by applicable law with regard to existing tribal lands held in reservation or Federal trust status. Such transfer shall not confer upon the tribe, or upon the lands within the reservation, any additional water rights. Tribal water rights shall be deemed to be defined in the compact.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to support the resolution of disputes over historical claims through settlements mutually agreed to by Indian and non-Indian parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Disputes over certain land claims of the Puyallup Tribe and other matters, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ownership of the Commencement Bay tidelands and areas of former Puyallup Riverbed, lands within the Puyallup Tribe's Treaty Reservation, or intended reservation boundaries,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) railroad and other rights-of-way,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) control of fisheries resource and habitat,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) business regulation and zoning,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">have resulted in difficult community relations and negative economic impacts affecting both the Tribe and non-Indian parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Some of the significant historical events that led to the present circumstances include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the negotiation of the Treaty of Medicine Creek in December 1854, by the Puyallup Indians and others, by which the tribes ceded most of their territories but reserved certain lands and rights, including fishing rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Executive Order of 1857 creating the Puyallup Indian Reservation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Executive Order of 1873, clarifying and extending the Puyallup Reservation in the Washington Territory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the March 11, 1891, Report of the Puyallup Indian Commission on allotments and the 1896 report by a second Puyallup Indian Commission describing the problems with sales of allotted lands; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) City of Salamanca and congressional villages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Disputes concerning leases of tribal lands within the city of Salamanca and the congressional villages, New York, have strained relations between the Indian and non-Indian communities and have resulted in adverse economic impacts affecting both communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Some of the significant historical events which have led to the present situation include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, several railroads obtained grants or leases of rights of way through the Allegany Reservation without Federal authorization or approval and on terms which did not adequately protect the interests of the Seneca Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after construction of these railroads, Allegany Reservation lands were leased to railroad employees, persons associated with the railroads, residents of the city and farmers without Federal authorization or approval and on terms which did not adequately protect the interests of the Seneca Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) none of these leases had Federal authorization or approval and, after the courts ruled these leases invalid, Congress enacted the Act of February 19, 1875 (18 Stat. 330), confirming existing leases of Allegany Reservation lands, authorizing further leasing by the Seneca Nation, and making the confirmed leases renewable for a twelve year period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Act of September 30, 1890 (26 Stat. 558), amended the 1875 Act by substituting a renewal term of &ldquo;not exceeding ninety-nine years&rdquo; for the original renewal term of twelve years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in 1952 the Seneca Nation filed a claim with the Indian Claims Commission against the United States for use of improper lease fees, and in 1977 a settlement was reached regarding such claim, providing for the payment of $600,000 to the Seneca Nation covering the period beginning in 1870 to the end of 1946.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An analysis of historic land values indicates that the payments made under the original lease agreement and under the settlement described in paragraph (2)(E) were well below the actual lease value of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The approaching expiration of the Salamanca and congressional village leases on February 19, 1991, has created significant uncertainty and concern on the part of the city of Salamanca and Salamanca residents, and among the residents of the congressional villages, many of whose families have resided on leased lands for generations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The future economic success of the Seneca Nation, city, and congressional villages is tied to the securing of a future lease agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Federal and State governments have agreed that there is a moral responsibility on the part of both governments to help secure a fair and equitable settlement for past inequities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to effectuate and support the Agreement between the city and the Seneca Nation, and facilitate the negotiation of new leases with lessees in the congressional villages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist in resolving the past inequities involving the 1890 leases and to secure fair and equitable compensation for the Seneca Nation based on the impact of these leases on the economy and culture of the Seneca Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide a productive environment between the Seneca Nation and lessees for negotiating the leases provided for under the Agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide stability and security to the city and the congressional villages, their residents, and businesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to promote the economic growth of the city and the congressional villages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to promote economic self-sufficiency for the Seneca Nation and its members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to promote cooperative economic and community development efforts on the part of the Seneca Nation and the city; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to avoid the potential legal liability on the part of the United States that could be a <!-- PDFPage:568 -->direct consequence of not reaching a settlement.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut received recognition by the United States pursuant to the administrative process under part 83 of title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut is the successor in interest to the aboriginal entity known as the Mohegan Indian Tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Mohegan Tribe has existed in the geographic area that is currently the State of Connecticut for a long period preceding the colonial period of the history of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Certain lands were sequestered as tribal lands by the Colony of Connecticut and subsequently by the State of Connecticut.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut v. State of Connecticut, et al. (Civil Action No. H&ndash;77&ndash;434, pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Connecticut) relates to the ownership of certain lands within the State of Connecticut.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Such action will likely result in economic hardships for residents of the State of Connecticut, including residents of the town of Montville, Connecticut, by encumbering the title to lands in the State, including lands that are not currently the subject of the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The State of Connecticut and the Mohegan Tribe have executed agreements for the purposes of resolving all disputes between the State of Connecticut and the Mohegan Tribe and providing a settlement for the action referred to in paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) In order to implement the agreements referred to in paragraphs (5) and (6) of section 1775a of this title that address matters of jurisdiction with respect to certain offenses committed by and against members of the Mohegan Tribe and other Indians in Indian country and matters of gaming-related development, it is necessary for the Congress to enact legislation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The town of Montville, Connecticut, will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be affected by the loss of a tax base from, and jurisdiction over, lands that will be held in trust by the United States on behalf of the Mohegan Tribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve as the host community for the gaming operations of the Mohegan Tribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The town of Montville and the Mohegan Tribe have entered into an agreement to resolve issues extant between them and to estab<!-- PDFPage:571 -->lish the basis for a cooperative government-to-government relationship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To facilitate the settlement of claims against the State of Connecticut by the Mohegan Tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To facilitate the removal of any encumbrance to any title to land in the State of Connecticut that would have resulted from the action referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Under the treaty between the United States of America and the Crow Tribe of Indians concluded May 7, 1868 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868&rdquo;; 15 Stat. 649), the eastern boundary of the Crow Indian Reservation was established as the 107th meridian for approximately 90 miles from the Yellowstone River to the boundary between Montana and Wyoming.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Under Executive orders issued in 1884 and 1900, the western boundary of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation was established as the 107th meridian. The 107th meridian was intended to be the common boundary between the Crow Reservation and Northern Cheyenne Reservation for approximately 25 miles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) From 1889 through 1891, a survey was conducted of the eastern boundary of the Crow Reservation. The 1891 survey line strayed to the west, and resulted in the exclusion from the Crow Indian Reservation of a strip of land of approximately 36,164 acres. Approximately 12,964 acres of such strip of land were included in the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Deposits of low sulphur coal underlie the land excluded from the Crow Indian Reservation, including the land included in the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The erroneous nature of the survey was not discovered for several decades. Meanwhile, the areas along the 107th meridian to the north and south of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation were opened to settlement in the late nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century. Patents were issued to non-Indian persons and to the State of Montana for most of the surface land and a significant portion of the minerals in these areas between the 107th meridian and the 1891 survey line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The 12,964 acres included in the Northern Cheyenne Reservation have been treated as part of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation and occupied by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Northern Cheyenne allottees, and their successors in interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Legislation to resolve the 107th meridian boundary dispute was introduced in Congress in the 1960's and 1970's, and again in 1992, but no such legislation was enacted into law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to settle the 107th meridian boundary dispute created by the erroneous survey of the eastern boundary of the Crow Indian Reservation made by the Federal Government described in subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1777. Findings and purposes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) For many years the Pueblo of Santo Domingo has been asserting claims to lands within its aboriginal use area in north central New Mexico. These claims have been the subject of many lawsuits, and a number of these claims remain unresolved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In December 1927, the Pueblo Lands Board, acting pursuant to the Pueblo Lands Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 636) confirmed a survey of the boundaries of the Pueblo of Santo Domingo Grant. However, at the same time the Board purported to extinguish Indian title to approximately 27,000 acres of lands within those grant boundaries which lay within 3 other overlapping Spanish land grants. The United States Court of Appeals in United States v. Thompson (941 F.2d 1074 (10th Cir. 1991), cert. denied 503 U.S. 984 (1992)), held that the Board &ldquo;ignored an express congressional directive&rdquo; in section 14 of the Pueblo Lands Act, which &ldquo;contemplated that the Pueblo would retain title to and possession of all overlap land&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Pueblo of Santo Domingo has asserted a claim to another 25,000 acres of land based on the Pueblo's purchase in 1748 of the Diego Gallegos Grant. The Pueblo possesses the original deed reflecting the purchase under Spanish law but, after the United States assumed sovereignty over New Mexico, no action <!-- PDFPage:581 -->was taken to confirm the Pueblo's title to these lands. Later, many of these lands were treated as public domain, and are held today by Federal agencies, the State Land Commission, other Indian tribes, and private parties. The Pueblo's lawsuit asserting this claim, Pueblo of Santo Domingo v. Rael (Civil No. 83&ndash;1888 (D.N.M.)), is still pending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Pueblo of Santo Domingo's claims against the United States in docket No. 355 under the Act of August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 1049; commonly referred to as the Indian Claims Commission Act) have been pending since 1951. These claims include allegations of the Federal misappropriation and mismanagement of the Pueblo's aboriginal and Spanish grant lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Litigation to resolve the land and trespass claims of the Pueblo of Santo Domingo would take many years, and the outcome of such litigation is unclear. The pendency of these claims has clouded private land titles and has created difficulties in the management of public lands within the claim area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The United States and the Pueblo of Santo Domingo have negotiated a settlement to resolve all existing land claims, including the claims described in paragraphs (2) through (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to remove the cloud on titles to land in the State of New Mexico resulting from the claims of the Pueblo of Santo Domingo, and to settle all of the Pueblo's claims against the United States and third parties, and the land, boundary, and trespass claims of the Pueblo in a fair, equitable, and final manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide for the restoration of certain lands to the Pueblo of Santo Domingo and to confirm the Pueblo's boundaries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to clarify governmental jurisdiction over the lands within the Pueblo's land claim area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to ratify a Settlement Agreement between the United States and the Pueblo which includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Pueblo's agreement to relinquish and compromise its land and trespass claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the provision of $8,000,000 to compensate the Pueblo for the claims it has pursued pursuant to the Act of August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 1049; commonly referred to as the Indian Claims Commission Act);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the transfer of approximately 4,577 acres of public land to the Pueblo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the sale of approximately 7,355 acres of national forest lands to the Pueblo; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the authorization of the appropriation of $15,000,000 over 3 consecutive years which would be deposited in a Santo Domingo Lands Claims Settlement Fund for expenditure by the Pueblo for land acquisition and other enumerated tribal purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to effectuate an extinguishment of, or to otherwise impair, the Pueblo's title to or interest in lands or water rights as described in section 1777c(a)(2) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1778. Congressional findings and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In 1876, the Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation was created, reserving a single, 640-acre section of land in the Coachella Valley, California, north of the Salton Sink. The Reservation was expanded in 1891 by Executive order, pursuant to the Mission Indian Relief Act of 1891, adding about 12,000 acres to the original 640-acre reservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Between 1905 and 1907, flood waters of the Colorado River filled the Salton Sink, creating the Salton Sea, inundating approximately 2,000 acres of the 1891 reservation lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In 1909, an additional 12,000 acres of land, 9,000 of which were then submerged under the Salton Sea, were added to the reservation under a Secretarial Order issued pursuant to a 1907 amendment of the Mission Indian Relief Act. Due to receding water levels in the Salton Sea through the process of evaporation, at the time of the 1909 enlargement of the reservation, there were some expectations that the Salton Sea would recede within a period of 25 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Through the present day, the majority of the lands added to the reservation in 1909 remain inundated due in part to the flowage of natural runoff and drainage water from the irrigation systems of the Imperial, Coachella, and Mexicali Valleys into the Salton Sea.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In addition to those lands that are inundated, there are also tribal and individual Indian lands located on the perimeter of the Salton Sea that are not currently irrigable due to lack of proper drainage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In 1982, the United States brought an action in trespass entitled &ldquo;United States of America, in its own right and on behalf of Torres-Martinez Band of Mission Indians and the Allottees therein v. the Imperial Irrigation District and Coachella Valley Water District&rdquo;, Case No. 82&ndash;1790 K (M) (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;U.S. Suit&rdquo;) on behalf of the Torres-Martinez Indian Tribe and affected Indian allottees against the two water districts seeking damages related to the inundation of tribal- and allottee-owned lands and injunctive relief to prevent future discharge of water on such lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) On August 20, 1992, the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California entered a judgment in the U.S. Suit requiring the Coachella Valley Water District to pay $212,908.41 in past and future damages and the Imperial Irrigation District to pay $2,795,694.33 in past and future damages in lieu of the United States request for a permanent injunction against continued flooding of the submerged lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The United States, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the Imperial Irrigation District have filed notices of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the district court's judgment in the U.S. Suit (Nos. 93&ndash;55389, 93&ndash;55398, and 93&ndash;55402), and the Tribe has filed a notice of appeal from the district court's denial of its motion to intervene as a matter of right (No. 92&ndash;55129).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stayed further action on the appeals pending the outcome of settlement negotiations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) In 1991, the Tribe brought its own lawsuit, Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, et al., v. Imperial Irrigation District, et al., Case No. 91&ndash;1670 J (LSP) (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Indian Suit&rdquo;) in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, against the two water districts, and amended the complaint to include as a plaintiff, Mary Resvaloso, in her own right, and as class representative of all other affected Indian allotment owners.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The Indian Suit has been stayed by the district court to facilitate settlement negotiations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to facilitate and implement the settlement agreement negotiated and executed by the parties to the U.S. Suit and Indian Suit for the purpose of resolving their conflicting claims to their mutual satisfaction and in the public interest.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1779. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to encourage the resolution of disputes over historical claims through mutually agreed-to settlements between Indian Nations and the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There are pending before the United States Court of Federal Claims certain lawsuits against the United States brought by the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations seeking monetary damages for the alleged use and mismanagement of tribal resources along the Arkansas River in eastern Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Cherokee Nation, a federally recognized Indian tribe with its present tribal headquarters south of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, having adopted its most recent constitution on June 26, 1976, and having entered into various treaties with the United States, including but not limited to the Treaty at Hopewell, executed on November 28, 1785 (7 Stat. 18), and the Treaty at Washington, D.C., executed on July 19, 1866 (14 Stat. 799), has maintained a continuous government-to-government relationship with the United States since the earliest years of the Union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Choctaw Nation, a federally recognized Indian tribe with its present tribal headquarters in Durant, Oklahoma, having adopted its most recent constitution on July 9, 1983, and having entered into various treaties with the United States of America, including but not limited to the Treaty at Hopewell, executed on January 3, 1786 (7 Stat. 21), and the Treaty at Washington, D.C., executed on April 28, 1866 (7 Stat. 21),<sup><a href="#1779_1_target" name="1779_1">1</a></sup> has maintained a continuous government-to-government relationship with the United States since the earliest years of the Union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Chickasaw Nation, a federally recognized Indian tribe with its present tribal headquarters in Ada, Oklahoma, having adopted its most recent constitution on August 27, 1983, and having entered into various treaties with the United States of America, including but not limited to the Treaty at Hopewell, executed on January 10, 1786 (7 Stat. 24), and the Treaty at Washington, D.C., executed on April 28, 1866 (7 Stat. 21),<sup><a href="#1779_1_target" name="1779_1">1</a></sup> has maintained a continuous government-to-government relationship with the United States since the earliest years of the Union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In the first half of the 19th century, the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations were forcibly removed from their homelands in the southeastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi in the Indian Territory that were ceded to them by the United States. From the &ldquo;Three Forks&rdquo; area near present day Muskogee, Oklahoma, downstream to the point of confluence with the Canadian River, the Arkansas River flowed entirely within the territory of the Cherokee Nation. From that point of confluence downstream to the Arkansas territorial line, the Arkansas River formed the boundary between the Cherokee Nation on the left side of the thread of the river and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations on the right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Pursuant to the Act of April 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 137),<sup><a href="#1779_2_target" name="1779_2">2</a></sup> tribal property not allotted to individuals or otherwise disposed of, including the bed and banks of the Arkansas River, passed to the United States in trust for the use and benefit of the respective Indian Nations in accordance with their respective interests therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) For more than 60 years after Oklahoma statehood, the Bureau of Indian Affairs believed that Oklahoma owned the Riverbed from the Arkansas State line to Three Forks, and therefore took no action to protect the Indian Nations&rsquo; Riverbed resources such as oil, gas, and Drybed Lands suitable for grazing and agriculture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Third parties with property near the Arkansas River began to occupy the Indian Nations&rsquo; Drybed Lands&mdash;lands that were under water at the time of statehood but that are now dry due to changes in the course of the river.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) In 1966, the Indian Nations sued the State of Oklahoma to recover their lands. In 1970, the Supreme Court of the United States decided in the case of Choctaw Nation vs. Oklahoma (396 U.S. 620),<sup><a href="#1779_3_target" name="1779_3">3</a></sup> that the Indian Nations retained title to their respective portions of the Riverbed along the navigable reach of the river.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) In 1987, the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of United States vs. Cherokee Nation (480 U.S. 700) decided that the riverbed lands did not gain an exemption from the Federal Government's navigational servitude and that the Cherokee Nation had no right to compensation for damage to its interest by exercise of the Government's servitude.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) In 1989, the Indian Nations filed lawsuits against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims (Case Nos. 218&ndash;89L and 630&ndash;89L), seeking damages for the United States&rsquo; use and mismanagement of tribal trust resources along the Arkansas River. Those actions are still pending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) In 1997, the United States filed quiet title litigation against individuals occupying some of the Indian Nations&rsquo; Drybed Lands. <!-- PDFPage:590 -->That action, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, was dismissed without prejudice on technical grounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Much of the Indian Nations&rsquo; Drybed Lands have been occupied by a large number of adjacent landowners in Oklahoma. Without Federal legislation, further litigation against thousands of such landowners would be likely and any final resolution of disputes would take many years and entail great expense to the United States, the Indian Nations, and the individuals and entities occupying the Drybed Lands and would seriously impair long-term economic planning and development for all parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The Councils of the Cherokee and Choctaw Nations and the Legislature of the Chickasaw Nation have each enacted tribal resolutions which would, contingent upon the passage of this subchapter and the satisfaction of its terms and in exchange for the moneys appropriated hereunder&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) settle and forever release their respective claims against the United States asserted by them in United States Court of Federal Claims Case Nos. 218&ndash;89L and 630&ndash;89L; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) forever disclaim any and all right, title, and interest in and to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, as set forth in those enactments of the respective councils of the Indian Nations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) The resolutions adopted by the respective Councils of the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations each provide that, contingent upon the passage of the settlement legislation and satisfaction of its terms, each Indian Nation agrees to dismiss, release, and forever discharge its claims asserted against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims, Case Nos. 218&ndash;89L and 630&ndash;89L, and to forever disclaim any right, title, or interest of the Indian Nation in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, in exchange for the funds appropriated and allocated to the Indian Nation under the provisions of the settlement legislation, which funds the Indian Nation agrees to accept in full satisfaction and settlement of all claims against the United States for the damages sought in the aforementioned claims asserted in the United States Court of Federal Claims, and as full and fair compensation for disclaiming its right, title, and interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) In those resolutions, each Indian Nation expressly reserved all of its beneficial interest and title to all other Riverbed lands, including minerals, as determined by the Supreme Court in Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U.S. 620 (1970), and further reserved any and all right, title, or interest that each Nation may have in and to the water flowing in the Arkansas River and its tributaries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Extinguishment of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to their respective tribal resolutions, and in exchange for the benefits conferred under this subchapter, the Indian Nations shall, on December 13, 2002, enter into a consent decree with the United States that waives, releases, and dismisses all the claims they have asserted or could have asserted in their cases numbered 218&ndash;89L and 630&ndash;89L pending in the United States Court of Federal Claims against the United States, including but not limited to claims arising out of any and all of the Indian Nations&rsquo; interests in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands and arising out of construction, maintenance and operation of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation Way. The Indian Nations and the United States shall lodge the consent decree with the Court of Federal Claims within 30 days of December 13, 2002, and shall move for entry of the consent decree at such time as all appropriations by Congress pursuant to the authority of this subchapter have been made and deposited into the appropriate tribal trust fund account of the Indian Nations as described in section 1779d of this title. Upon entry of the consent decree, all the Indian Nations&rsquo; claims and all their past, present, and future right, title, and interest to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, shall be deemed extinguished. No claims may be asserted in the future against the United States pursuant to sections 1491, 1346(a)(2), or 1505 of title 28 for actions taken or failed to have been taken by the United States for events occurring prior to the date of the extinguishment of claims with respect to the Riverbed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Release of tribal claims to certain Drybed Lands</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the deposit of all funds authorized for appropriation under subsection (c) of this section for an Indian Nation into the appropriate trust fund account described in section 1779d of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all claims now existing or which may arise in the future with respect to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands and all right, title, and interest that the Indian Nations and the United States as trustee on behalf of the Indian Nation may have to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, shall be deemed extinguished;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any interest of the Indian Nations or the United States as trustee on their behalf in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands shall further be extinguished pursuant to the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, Act of July 22, 1790 (ch. 33, 1 Stat. 137), and all subsequent amendments thereto (as codified at 25 U.S.C. 177);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to the extent parties other than the Indian Nations have transferred interests in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands in violation of the Trade and Intercourse Act, Congress does hereby approve and ratify such transfers of interests in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands to the extent that such transfers otherwise are valid under law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Secretary is authorized to execute an appropriate document citing this subchapter, suitable for filing with the county clerks, or such other county official as appropriate, of those counties wherein the foregoing described lands are located, disclaiming any tribal or Federal interest on behalf of the Indian Nations in such Disclaimed Drybed Lands. The Secretary is authorized to file with the counties a plat or map of the disclaimed lands should the Secretary determine that such filing will clarify the extent of lands disclaimed. Such a plat or map may be filed regardless of whether the map or plat has been previously approved for filing, whether or not the map or plat has been filed, and regardless of whether the map or plat constitutes a final determination by the Secretary of the extent of the Indian Nations&rsquo; original claim to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands. The disclaimer filed by the United States shall constitute a disclaimer of the Disclaimed Drybed Lands for purposes of the Trade and Intercourse Act (25 U.S.C. 177).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Indian Nations do not relinquish any right, title, or interest in any lands which constitute the Wetbed Lands subject to the navigational servitude exercised by the United States on the Wetbed Lands. By virtue of the exercise of the navigational servitude, the United States shall not be liable to the Indian Nations for any loss they may have related to the minerals in the Wetbed Lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no provision of this subchapter shall be construed to extinguish or convey any water rights of the Indian Nations in the Arkansas River or any other stream or the beneficial interests or title of any of the Indian Nations in and to lands held in trust by the United States on December 13, 2002, which lie above or below the mean high water mark of the Arkansas River, except for the Disclaimed Drybed Lands; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Indian Nations do not relinquish any right, title, or interest in any lands or minerals of certain unallotted tracts which are identified in the official records of the Eastern Oklahoma Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the event the Court of Federal Claims does not enter the consent decree as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the United <!-- PDFPage:592 -->States shall be entitled to setoff against any claims of the Indian Nations as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, any funds transferred to the Indian Nations pursuant to section 1779d of this title, and any interest accrued thereon up to the date of setoff.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Quiet title actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the United States nor any department of the United States nor the Indian Nations shall be made parties to any quiet title lawsuit or other lawsuit to determine ownership of or an interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands initiated by any private person or private entity after execution of the disclaimer set out in subsection (b)(1) of this section. The United States will have no obligation to undertake any future quiet title actions or actions for the recovery of lands or funds relating to any Drybed Lands retained by the Indian Nation or Indian Nations under this subchapter, including any lands which are Wetbed Lands on December 13, 2002, but which subsequently lie above the mean high water mark of the Arkansas River and the failure or declination to initiate any quiet title action or to manage any such Drybed Lands shall not constitute a breach of trust by the United States or be compensable to the Indian Nation or Indian Nations in any manner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Land to be conveyed in fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the United States determines that it is able to effectively maintain the McClellan-Kerr Navigation Way without retaining title to lands above the high water mark of the Arkansas River as of December 13, 2002, said lands, after being declared surplus, shall be conveyed in fee to the Indian Nation within whose boundary the land is located. The United States shall not be obligated to accept such property in trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization for settlement appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated an aggregate sum of $40,000,000 as follows:</p>
