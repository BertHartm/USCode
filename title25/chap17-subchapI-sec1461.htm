The fund shall be available for loans to Indians having a form of organization that is satisfactory to the Secretary and for loans to individual Indians: <em>Provided</em>, That, where the Secretary determines a rejection of a loan application from a member of an organization making loans to its membership from moneys borrowed from the fund is unwarranted, he may, in his discretion, make a direct loan to such individual from the fund. The fund shall also be available for administrative expenses incurred in connection therewith, or, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, as a contribution to the Indian Loan Guaranty and Insurance Fund authorized by section 1497 of this title, or for the payment of interest subsidies authorized by section 1511 of this title.</p>
