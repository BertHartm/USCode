<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has resulted in an effective and honest accounting of all revenues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) has resulted in a reputation for safe, fair, and honest operation of the activity; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Class III gaming activities shall be lawful on Indian lands only if such activities are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) authorized by an ordinance or resolution that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is adopted by the governing body of the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over such lands,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If any Indian tribe proposes to engage in, or to authorize any person or entity to engage in, a class III gaming activity on Indian lands of the Indian tribe, the governing body of the Indian tribe shall adopt and submit to the Chairman an ordinance or resolution that meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Chairman shall approve any ordinance or resolution described in subparagraph (A), unless the Chairman specifically determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the tribal governing body was significantly and unduly influenced in the adoption of such ordinance or resolution by any person identified in section 2711(e)(1)(D) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Upon the approval of such an ordinance or resolution, the Chairman shall publish in the Federal Register such ordinance or resolution and the order of approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Effective with the publication under subparagraph (B) of an ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body of an Indian tribe that has been approved by the Chairman under subparagraph (B), class III gaming activity on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe shall be fully subject to the terms and conditions of the Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3) by the Indian tribe that is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) The governing body of an Indian tribe, in its sole discretion and without the approval of the Chairman, may adopt an ordinance or resolution revoking any prior ordinance or resolution that authorized class III gaming on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe. Such revocation shall render class III gaming illegal on the Indian lands of such Indian tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Indian tribe shall submit any revocation ordinance or resolution described in clause (i) to the Chairman.

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) any person or entity operating a class III gaming activity pursuant to this paragraph on <!-- PDFPage:633 -->the date on which an ordinance or resolution described in clause (i) that revokes authorization for such class III gaming activity is published in the Federal Register may, during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which such revocation ordinance or resolution is published under clause (ii), continue to operate such activity in conformance with the Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3) that is in effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) any civil action that arises before, and any crime that is committed before, the close of such 1-year period shall not be affected by such revocation ordinance or resolution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the Indian lands upon which a class III gaming activity is being conducted, or is to be conducted, shall request the State in which such lands are located to enter into negotiations for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities. Upon receiving such a request, the State shall negotiate with the Indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any State and any Indian tribe may enter into a Tribal-State compact governing gaming activities on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe, but such compact shall take effect only when notice of approval by the Secretary of such compact has been published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any Tribal-State compact negotiated under subparagraph (A) may include provisions relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the application of the criminal and civil laws and regulations of the Indian tribe or the State that are directly related to, and necessary for, the licensing and regulation of such activity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) taxation by the Indian tribe of such activity in amounts comparable to amounts assessed by the State for comparable activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) remedies for breach of contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) standards for the operation of such activity and maintenance of the gaming facility, including licensing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) any other subjects that are directly related to the operation of gaming activities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except for any assessments that may be agreed to under paragraph (3)(C)(iii) of this subsection, nothing in this section shall be interpreted as conferring upon a State or any of its political subdivisions authority to impose any tax, fee, charge, or other assessment upon an Indian tribe or upon any other person or entity authorized by an Indian tribe to engage in a class III activity. No State may refuse to enter into the negotiations described in paragraph (3)(A) based upon the lack of authority in such State, or its political subdivisions, to impose such a tax, fee, charge, or other assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing in this subsection shall impair the right of an Indian tribe to regulate class III gaming on its Indian lands concurrently with the State, except to the extent that such regulation is inconsistent with, or less stringent than, the State laws and regulations made applicable by any Tribal-State compact entered into by the Indian tribe under paragraph (3) that is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The provisions of section 1175 of title 15 shall not apply to any gaming conducted under a Tribal-State compact that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is entered into under paragraph (3) by a State in which gambling devices are legal, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is in effect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction over&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failure of a State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or to conduct such negotiations in good faith,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any cause of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin a class III gaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3) that is in effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any cause of action initiated by the Secretary to enforce the procedures prescribed under subparagraph (B)(vii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of action described in subparagraph (A)(i) only after the close of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the Indian tribe requested the State to enter into negotiations under paragraph (3)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), upon the introduction of evidence by an Indian tribe that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a Tribal-State compact has not been entered into under paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the State did not respond to the request of the Indian tribe to negotiate such a compact or did not respond to such request in good faith,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the burden of proof shall be upon the State to prove that the State has negotiated with the Indian tribe in good faith to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If, in any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), the court finds that the State has failed to negotiate in good faith with the Indian tribe to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities, the court shall order the State and the Indian Tribe&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2710_2_target" name="2710_2">2</a></sup> to conclude such a compact within a 60-day period. In determining in such an action whether a State has negotiated in good faith, the court&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) may take into account the public interest, public safety, criminality, financial integrity, and adverse economic impacts on existing gaming activities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) shall consider any demand by the State for direct taxation of the Indian tribe or of any Indian lands as evidence that the State has not negotiated in good faith.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If a State and an Indian tribe fail to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the con<!-- PDFPage:634 -->duct of gaming activities on the Indian lands subject to the jurisdiction of such Indian tribe within the 60-day period provided in the order of a court issued under clause (iii), the Indian tribe and the State shall each submit to a mediator appointed by the court a proposed compact that represents their last best offer for a compact. The mediator shall select from the two proposed compacts the one which best comports with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable Federal law and with the findings and order of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) The mediator appointed by the court under clause (iv) shall submit to the State and the Indian tribe the compact selected by the mediator under clause (iv).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) If a State consents to a proposed compact during the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the proposed compact is submitted by the mediator to the State under clause (v), the proposed compact shall be treated as a Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) If the State does not consent during the 60-day period described in clause (vi) to a proposed compact submitted by a mediator under clause (v), the mediator shall notify the Secretary and the Secretary shall prescribe, in consultation with the Indian tribe, procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) which are consistent with the proposed compact selected by the mediator under clause (iv), the provisions of this chapter, and the relevant provisions of the laws of the State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) under which class III gaming may be conducted on the Indian lands over which the Indian tribe has jurisdiction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) The Secretary is authorized to approve any Tribal-State compact entered into between an Indian tribe and a State governing gaming on Indian lands of such Indian tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may disapprove a compact described in subparagraph (A) only if such compact violates&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any provision of this chapter,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any other provision of Federal law that does not relate to jurisdiction over gaming on Indian lands, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the trust obligations of the United States to Indians.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Secretary does not approve or disapprove a compact described in subparagraph (A) before the date that is 45 days after the date on which the compact is submitted to the Secretary for approval, the compact shall be considered to have been approved by the Secretary, but only to the extent the compact is consistent with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of any Tribal-State compact that is approved, or considered to have been approved, under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) An Indian tribe may enter into a management contract for the operation of a class III gaming activity if such contract has been submitted to, and approved by, the Chairman. The Chairman's review and approval of such contract shall be governed by the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and (h) of section 2711 of this title.</p>
