Persons entitled to enrollment under clause (a) of this section shall be enrolled by the Secretary of the Interior without further application. Persons claiming to be entitled to enrollment under clauses (b) or (c) of this section shall, within one year after May 24, 1950, make an application in writing to the Secretary of the Interior for enrollment, unless they have previously filed such an application under this section. For the purposes of clause (d) of this section, when the Secretary of the Interior is satisfied that reasonable and diligent efforts have been made to locate a person whose name is on said roll and that such person cannot be located, he may presume that such person died prior to May 24, 1950, and his presumption shall be conclusive. The Secretary of the Interior shall prepare not less than five hundred copies of an alphabetical list of the Indians of California whose names appear on the roll approved on May 16, 1933, giving the name, address, and age at time of enrollment of each such enrollee, together with such other factual information, if any, as the Secretary may deem advisable as tending to identify each enrollee, and shall distribute copies of this list to the various communities of California Indians. The Indians of California in each community may elect a committee of three enrollees who may aid the enrolling agent in any matters relating to the revision of said roll. After the expiration of the period allowed by this section for filing applications, the Secretary of the Interior shall have until June 30, 1955, to approve and promulgate the revised roll of the Indians of California provided for in this section. Upon such approval and promulgation, the roll shall be closed and thereafter no additional names shall be added thereto.</p>

The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to withdraw from the fund on deposit in the Treasury of the United States arising from the judgment in favor of the Indians of California entered by the Court of Claims on December 4, 1944, and appropriated for them by section 203 of the Act of April 25, 1945 (59 Stat. 77), such sums as may be necessary to make the per capita payments required by this section, including not to exceed $15,000 for the purpose of defraying the expenses incident to carrying out the provisions of sections 657 and 658 of this title. Such payments shall be made out of the accumulated interest on such judgment fund and so much of the principal thereof as is necessary to complete the payments.
