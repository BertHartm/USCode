<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) demonstrate that the extent of such issuance and guarantee under this subchapter is within the financial capacity of the tribe and is not likely to impair the ability to use grant amounts under subchapter I of this chapter, taking into consideration the requirements under section 4133(b) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) furnish, at the discretion of the Secretary, such other security as may be deemed appropriate by the Secretary in making such guarantees, including increments in local tax receipts generated by the activities assisted under this chapter or disposition proceeds from the sale of land or rehabilitated property.</p>
