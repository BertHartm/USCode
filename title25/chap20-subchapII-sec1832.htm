No such college or university shall be ineligible for such a grant for a fiscal year by reason of the receipt of such a grant for a preceding fiscal year, but no such college or university shall be eligible for such a grant for a fiscal year if such college or university has been awarded a grant under section 1065 of title 20 for such fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any earnings of the funds so deposited;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provides that such funds will be deposited in such a manner as to insure the accumulation of interest thereon at a rate not less than that generally available for similar funds deposited at the banking or savings institution for the same period or periods of time;</p>
