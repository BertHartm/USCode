<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the tribal right of self-government flows from the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes and nations;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) although progress has been made, the Federal bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regula<!-- PDFPage:183 -->tions, has eroded tribal self-governance and dominates tribal affairs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project [established by title III of Pub. L. 93&ndash;638, formerly set out as a note under 25 U.S.C. 450f] was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States and to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding and program management; and</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) transferring control to tribal governments, upon tribal request, over funding and decisionmaking for Federal programs, services, functions, and activities, or portions thereof, is an effective way to implement the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian tribes; and</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to coexist with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination Act [title I of Pub. L. 93&ndash;638, see Short Title note set out under section 450 of this title] relating to the provision of Indian services by designated Federal agencies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian tribes and Indian individuals;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of programs and services to provide Indian tribes with meaningful authority to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer programs, services, functions, and activities that meet the needs of the individual tribal communities; and</p>
