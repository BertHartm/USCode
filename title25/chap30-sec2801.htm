<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) less than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement officers patrol more than 56,000,000 acres of Indian country, which reflects less than &frac12; of the law enforcement presence in comparable rural communities nationwide;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to empower tribal governments with the authority, resources, and information necessary to safely and effectively provide public safety in Indian country;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to reduce the prevalence of violent crime in Indian country and to combat sexual and domestic violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women;</p>
