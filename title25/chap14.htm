<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the prolonged Federal domination of Indian service programs has served to retard rather than enhance the progress of Indian people and their communities by depriving Indians of the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of self-government, and has denied to the Indian people an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians which are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Indian people will never surrender their desire to control their relationships both among themselves and with non-Indian governments, organizations, and persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process which will insure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) Our Nation, under the law of the United States, in accordance with treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and judicial decisions, has recognized the right of Indian tribes to self-government. As domestic dependent nations, Indian tribes exercise inherent sovereign powers over their members and territory. The United States continues to work with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis to address issues concerning Indian tribal self-government, tribal trust resources, and Indian tribal treaty and other rights.</p>

<p class="note-body">(1) encourage Indian tribes to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) where possible, defer to Indian tribes to establish standards; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) in determining whether to establish Federal standards, consult with tribal officials as to the need for Federal standards and any alternatives that would limit the scope of Federal standards or otherwise preserve the prerogatives and authority of Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Special Requirements for Legislative Proposals</em>. Agencies shall not submit to the Congress legislation that would be inconsistent with the policymaking criteria in Section 3.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Government-to-Government Relations With Native American Tribal Governments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 29, 1994, 59 F.R. 22951, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States Government has a unique legal relationship with Native American tribal governments as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, and court decisions. As executive departments and agencies undertake activities affecting Native American tribal rights or trust resources, such activities should be implemented in a knowledgeable, sensitive manner respectful of tribal sovereignty. Today, as part of an historic meeting, I am outlining principles that executive departments and agencies, including every component bureau and office, are to follow in their interactions with Native American tribal governments. The purpose of these principles is to clarify our responsibility to ensure that the Federal Government operates within a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized Native American tribes. I am strongly committed to building a more effective day-to-day working relationship reflecting respect for the rights of self-government due the sovereign tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to ensure that the rights of sovereign tribal governments are fully respected, executive branch activities shall be guided by the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The head of each executive department and agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the department or agency operates within a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each executive department and agency shall consult, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, with tribal governments prior to taking actions that affect federally recognized tribal governments. All such consultations are to be open and candid so that all interested parties may evaluate for themselves the potential impact of relevant proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Each executive department and agency shall assess the impact of Federal Government plans, projects, programs, and activities on tribal trust resources and assure that tribal government rights and concerns are considered during the development of such plans, projects, programs, and activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Each executive department and agency shall take appropriate steps to remove any procedural impediments to working directly and effectively with tribal governments on activities that affect the trust property and/or governmental rights of the tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Each executive department and agency shall work cooperatively with other Federal departments and agencies to enlist their interest and support in cooperative efforts, where appropriate, to accomplish the goals of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Each executive department and agency shall apply the requirements of Executive Orders Nos. 12875 (&ldquo;Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership&rdquo;) [former 5 U.S.C. 601 note] and 12866 (&ldquo;Regulatory Planning and Review&rdquo;) [5 U.S.C. 601 note] to design solutions and tailor Federal programs, in appropriate circumstances, to address specific or unique needs of tribal communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department and agency shall ensure that the department or agency's bureaus and components are fully aware of this memorandum, through publication or other means, and that they are in compliance with its requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right to administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Request by tribe; authorized programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is directed, upon the request of any Indian tribe by tribal resolution, to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts with a tribal organization to plan, conduct, and administer programs or portions thereof, including construction programs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provided for in the Act of April 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 596), as amended [25 U.S.C. 452 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which the Secretary is authorized to administer for the benefit of Indians under the Act of November 2, 1921 (42 Stat. 208) [25 U.S.C. 13], and any Act subsequent thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Act of August 5, 1954 (68 Stat. 674), as amended [42 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) administered by the Secretary for the benefit of Indians for which appropriations are made to agencies other than the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of the Interior; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians without regard to the agency or office of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of the Interior within which it is performed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The programs, functions, services, or activities that are contracted under this paragraph shall include administrative functions of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services (whichever is applicable) that support the delivery of services to Indians, including those administrative activities supportive of, but not included as part of, the service delivery programs described in this paragraph that are otherwise contractable. The administrative functions referred to in the preceding sentence shall be contractable without regard to the organizational level within the Department that carries out such functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If so authorized by an Indian tribe under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a tribal organization may submit a proposal for a self-determination contract, or a proposal to amend or renew a self-determination contract, to the Secretary for review. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4), the Secretary shall, within ninety days after receipt of the proposal, approve the proposal and award the contract unless the Secretary provides written notification to the ap<!-- PDFPage:141 -->plicant that contains a specific finding that clearly demonstrates that, or that is supported by a controlling legal authority that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the particular program or function to be contracted will not be satisfactory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the proposed project or function to be contracted for cannot be properly completed or maintained by the proposed contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the program, function, service, or activity (or portion thereof) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities covered under paragraph (1) because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may extend or otherwise alter the 90-day period specified in the second sentence of this subsection,<sup><a href="#450f_1_target" name="450f_1">1</a></sup> if before the expiration of such period, the Secretary obtains the voluntary and express written consent of the tribe or tribal organization to extend or otherwise alter such period. The contractor shall include in the proposal of the contractor the standards under which the tribal organization will operate the contracted program, service, function, or activity, including in the area of construction, provisions regarding the use of licensed and qualified architects, applicable health and safety standards, adherence to applicable Federal, State, local, or tribal building codes and engineering standards. The standards referred to in the preceding sentence shall ensure structural integrity, accountability of funds, adequate competition for subcontracting under tribal or other applicable law, the commencement, performance, and completion of the contract, adherence to project plans and specifications (including any applicable Federal construction guidelines and manuals), the use of proper materials and workmanship, necessary inspection and testing, and changes, modifications, stop work, and termination of the work when warranted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the request of a tribal organization that operates two or more mature self-determination contracts, those contracts may be consolidated into one single contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall approve any severable portion of a contract proposal that does not support a declination finding described in paragraph (2). If the Secretary determines under such paragraph that a contract proposal&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proposes in part to plan, conduct, or administer a program, function, service, or activity that is beyond the scope of programs covered under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) proposes a level of funding that is in excess of the applicable level determined under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">subject to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and the tribal organization agree to, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, approve such portion of the program, function, service, or activity as is authorized under paragraph (1) or approve a level of funding authorized under section 450j&ndash;1(a) of this title. If a tribal organization elects to carry out a severable portion of a contract proposal pursuant to this paragraph, subsection (b) of this section shall only apply to the portion of the contract that is declined by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedure upon refusal of request to contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary declines to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide assistance to the tribal organization to overcome the stated objections, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide the tribal organization with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the objections raised, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, except that the tribe or tribal organization may, in lieu of filing such appeal, exercise the option to initiate an action in a Federal district court and proceed directly to such court pursuant to section 450m&ndash;1(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability insurance; waiver of defense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Beginning in 1990, the Secretary shall be responsible for obtaining or providing liability insurance or equivalent coverage, on the most cost-effective basis, for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and tribal contractors carrying out contracts, grant agreements and cooperative agreements pursuant to this subchapter. In obtaining or providing such coverage, the Secretary shall take into consideration the extent to which liability under such contracts or agreements are covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In obtaining or providing such coverage, the Secretary shall, to the greatest extent practicable, give a preference to coverage underwritten by Indian-owned economic enterprises as defined in section 1452 of this title, except that, for the purposes of this subsection, such enterprises may include non-profit corporations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any policy of insurance obtained or provided by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall contain a provision that the insurance carrier shall waive any right it may have to raise as a defense the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe from suit, but that such waiver shall extend only to claims the amount and nature of which are within the coverage and limits of the policy and shall not authorize or empower such insurance carrier to waive or otherwise limit the tribe's sovereign immunity outside or beyond the coverage or limits of the policy of insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No waiver of the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe pursuant to this paragraph shall include a waiver to the extent of any potential liability for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages or for any other limitation on liability imposed by the law of the State in which the alleged injury occurs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where a tribal organization's allowable indirect cost recoveries are below the level of indirect costs that the tribal organizations should have received for any given year pursuant to its approved indirect cost rate, and such shortfall is the result of lack of full indirect cost funding by any Federal, State, or other agency, such shortfall in recoveries shall not form the basis for any theoretical over-recovery or other adverse adjustment to any future years&rsquo; indirect cost rate or amount for such tribal organization, nor shall any agency seek to collect such shortfall from the tribal organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to fund less than the full amount of need for indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liability for indebtedness incurred before fiscal year 1992</h4>

Such notice shall set forth the right of appeal and hearing to the board of contract appeals pursuant to section 450m&ndash;1 of this title. For the purpose of determining the 365-day period specified in this paragraph, an audit report shall be deemed to have been received on the date of actual receipt by the Secretary, if, within 60 days after receiving the report, the Secretary does not give notice of a determination by the Secretary to reject the single-agency report as insufficient due to noncompliance with chapter 75 of title 31 or noncompliance with any other applicable law. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to enlarge the rights of the Secretary with respect to section 476 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Addition to contract of full amount contractor entitled; adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the approval of a self-determination contract, the Secretary shall add to the contract the full amount of funds to which the contractor is entitled under subsection (a) of this section, subject to adjustments for each subsequent year that such tribe or tribal organization administers a Federal program, function, service, or activity under such contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Indirect costs for contracts for construction programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In calculating the indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract for a construction program, the Secretary shall take into consideration only those costs associated with the administration of the contract and shall not take into consideration those moneys actually passed on by the tribal organization to construction contractors and subcontractors.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Suspension, withholding, or delay in payment of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may only suspend, withhold, or delay the payment of funds for a period of 30 days beginning on the date the Secretary makes a determination under this paragraph to a tribal organization under a self-determination contract, if the Secretary determines that the tribal organization has failed to substantially carry out the contract without good cause. In any such case, the Secretary shall provide the tribal organization with reasonable advance written notice, technical assistance (subject to available resources) to assist the tribal organization, a hearing on the record not later than 10 days after the date of such determination or such later date as the tribal organization shall approve, and promptly release any funds withheld upon subsequent compliance.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Reduction of administrative or other responsibilities of Secretary; use of savings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent that programs, functions, services, or activities carried out by tribal organizations pursuant to contracts entered into under this subchapter reduce the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings that have not otherwise been included in the amount of contract funds determined under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall make such savings available for the provision of additional services to program beneficiaries, either directly or through contractors, in a manner equitable to both direct and contracted programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Rebudgeting by tribal organization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including any regulation), a tribal organization that carries out a self-determination contract may, with respect to allocations within the approved budget of the contract, rebudget to meet contract requirements, if such rebudgeting would not have an adverse effect on the performance of the contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Program income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All Medicare, Medicaid, or other program income earned by an Indian tribe shall be treated as supplemental funding to that negotiated in the funding agreement. The Indian tribe may retain all such income and expend such funds in the current year or in future years except to the extent that the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) provides otherwise for Medicare and Medicaid receipts. Such funds shall not result in any offset or reduction in the amount of funds the Indian tribe is authorized to receive under its funding agreement in the year the program income is received or for any subsequent fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Limitation of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An Indian tribe shall not be obligated to continue performance that requires an expenditure of funds in excess of the amount of funds transferred under a compact or funding agreement. If at any time the Indian tribe has reason to believe that the total amount provided for a specific activity in the compact or funding agreement is insufficient the Indian tribe shall provide reasonable notice of such insufficiency to the Secretary. If the Secretary does not increase the amount of funds transferred under the funding agreement, the Indian tribe may suspend performance of the activity until such time as additional funds are transferred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of effecting consolidations of land situated within the Spokane Indian Reservation in the State of Washington into the ownership of the tribe and of individual tribal members and for the purpose of attaining and preserving an economic land base for Indian use, alleviating problems of Indian heirship and assisting in the productive leasing, disposition, and other use of tribal lands, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized in his discretion to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Purchase for the Spokane Tribe of Indians with any funds of such tribe and to otherwise acquire by gift, exchange, or relinquishment any lands or interest in lands or improvements thereon within the Spokane Indian Reservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Sell or approve sales of any tribal trust lands, any interest therein or improvements thereon.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nontaxability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Title to lands, or any interests therein, acquired pursuant to this Act for the Spokane Tribe or individual enrolled members thereof, shall be taken in the name of the United States of America in trust for the tribe or individual Indian, and shall be nontaxable as other tribal and allotted Indian trust lands of the Spokane Reservation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Lands held by mortgage or deed of trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">That any tribal land that may be sold pursuant to this Act may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, be encumbered by a mortgage or deed of trust and shall be subject to foreclosure or sale pursuant to the terms of such a mortgage or deed of trust in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The United States shall be an indispensable party to any such proceeding with the right of removal of the clause to the United States district court for the district in which the land is located, following the procedure in section 1446 of title 28: <em>Provided</em>, That the United States shall have the right to appeal from any order of remand in the case.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Acquisition and sale procedures; land purchase and consolidation program</h4>

Such acquisition by the Spokane Tribe, or individual members thereof, may be achieved by exchange of lands with Indians or non-Indians as well as outright purchase, with adjusting payments to approximate equal value. Moneys or credits received by the tribe in the sale of lands shall be used for the purchase of other lands, or for such other purpose as may be consistent with the land purchase and consolidation program, approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 564d and 564e of this title, and all Acts amendatory thereof&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(a) Designation of boundaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tribal lands that comprise the Klamath Indian Forest, and the tribal lands that comprise the Klamath Marsh, shall be designated by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, jointly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(b) Sales; terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The portion of the Klamath Indian Forest that is selected for sale pursuant to section 564d(a)(3) of this title to pay members who withdraw from the tribe shall be offered for sale by the Secretary of the Interior in appropriate units, on the basis of competitive bids, to any purchaser or purchasers who agree to manage the forest lands as far as practicable according to sustained yield procedures so as to furnish a continuous supply of timber according to plans to be prepared and submitted by them for approval and inclusion in the conveyancing instruments in accordance with specifications and requirements referred to in the invitations for bids: <em>Provided</em>, That no sale shall be for a price that is less than the realization value of the units involved determined as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The terms and conditions of the sales shall be prescribed by the Secretary. The specifications and minimum requirements to be included in the invitations for bids, and the determination of appropriate units for sale, shall be developed and made jointly by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture. Such plans when prepared by the purchaser shall include provisions for the conservation of soil and water resources as well as for the management of the timber resources as hereinbefore set forth in this section. Such plans shall be satisfactory to and have the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture as complying with the minimum standards included in said specifications and requirements before the prospective purchaser shall be entitled to have his bid considered by the Secretary of the Interior and the failure on the part of the purchaser to prepare and submit a satisfactory plan to the Secretary of Agriculture shall constitute grounds for rejection of such bid. Such plans shall be incorporated as conditions in the conveyancing instruments executed by the Secretary and shall be binding on the grantee and all successors in interest. The conveyancing instruments shall provide for a forfeiture and a reversion of title to the lands to the United States, not in trust for or subject to Indian use, in the event of a breach of such conditions. The purchase price paid by the grantee shall be deemed to represent the full appraised fair market value of the lands, undiminished by the right of reversion retained by the United States in a nontrust status, and the retention of such right of reversion shall not be the basis for any claim against the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture shall be responsible for enforcing such conditions. Upon any reversion of title pursuant to this subsection, the lands shall become national forest lands subject to the laws that are applicable to lands acquired pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961), as amended.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(c) Appraisals; notice to Congressional committees; appropriation; realization value; report to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within sixty days after August 23, 1958 the Secretary of the Interior shall contract by negotiation with three qualified appraisers or three qualified appraisal organizations for a review of the appraisal approved by the Secretary pursuant to section 564d(a)(2) of this title. In such review full consideration shall be given to all reasonably ascertainable elements of land, forest, and mineral values. Not less than thirty days before executing such contracts the Secretary shall notify the chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the names and addresses of the appraisers selected. The cost of the appraisal review shall be paid from tribal funds which are made available for such purpose, subject to full reimbursement by the United States, and the appropriation of funds for that purpose is authorized. Upon the basis of a review of the appraisal heretofore made of the forest units and marsh lands involved and such other materials as may be readily available, including additional market data since the date of the prior appraisal, but without making any new and independent appraisal, each appraiser shall estimate the fair market value of such forest units and marsh lands as if they had been offered for sale on a competitive market without limitation on use during the interval between the adjournment of the Eighty-fifth Congress and the termination date specified in section 564e(b) of this title. This value shall be known as the realization value. If the three appraisers are not able to agree on the realization value of such forest units and marsh lands, then such realization values shall be determined by averaging the values estimated by each appraiser. The Secretary shall report such realization values to the chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and to the chairman of the Senate Com<!-- PDFPage:222 -->mittee on Interior and Insular Affairs not later than January 15, 1959. No sale of forest units that comprise the Klamath Indian Forest designated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be made under the provisions of this subchapter prior to April 1, 1959.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(d) Unsold forest units and marsh lands; title after publication in Federal Register; aggregate realization value; appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If all of the forest units offered for sale in accordance with subsection (b) of this section are not sold before April 1, 1961, the Secretary of Agriculture shall publish in the Federal Register a proclamation taking title in the name of the United States to as many of the unsold units or parts thereof as have, together with the Klamath Marsh lands acquired pursuant to subsection (f) of the section, an aggregate realization value of not to exceed $90,000,000, which shall be the maximum amount payable for lands acquired by the United States pursuant to this subchapter. Compensation for the forest lands so taken shall be the realization value of the lands determined as provided in subsection (c) of this section, unless a different amount is provided by law enacted prior to the proclamation of the Secretary of Agriculture. Appropriation of funds for that purpose is authorized. Payment shall be made as soon as possible after the proclamation of the Secretary of Agriculture. Such lands shall become national forest lands subject to the laws that are applicable to lands acquired pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961), as amended. Any of the forest units that are offered for sale and that are not sold or taken pursuant to subsection (b) or (d) of this section shall be subject to sale without limitation on use in accordance with the provisions of section 564d of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(e) Sale of retained lands to Secretary of Agriculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If at any time any of the tribal lands that comprise the Klamath Indian Forest and that are retained by the tribe are offered for sale other than to members of the tribe, such lands shall first be offered for sale to the Secretary of Agriculture, who shall be given a period of twelve months after the date of each such offer within which to purchase such lands. No such lands shall be sold at a price below the price at which they have been offered for sale to the Secretary of Agriculture, and if such lands are reoffered for sale they shall first be reoffered to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to purchase such lands subject to such terms and conditions as to the use thereof as he may deem appropriate, and any lands so acquired shall thereupon become national forest lands subject to the laws that are applicable to lands acquired pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961), as amended.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(f) Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge; appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lands that comprise the Klamath Marsh shall be a part of the property selected for sale pursuant to section 564d(a)(3) of this title to pay members who withdraw from the tribe. Title to such lands is taken in the name of the United States, effective the earliest date after September 30, 1959, when the Secretary of the Interior determines that funds for the payment of the purchase price are available from the sale of stamps under the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act of March 16, 1934, as amended [16 U.S.C. 718 et seq.]. Such lands are designated as the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, which shall be administered in accordance with the law applicable to areas acquired pursuant to section 4 of the Act of March 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 451), as amended or supplemented [16 U.S.C. 718d]. Compensation for said taking shall be the realization value of the lands determined in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, and shall be paid out of funds in the Treasury of the United States, which are authorized to be appropriated for that purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(g) Homesites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person whose name appears on the final roll of the tribe, and who has since December 31, 1956, continuously resided on any lands taken by the United States by subsections (d) and (f) of this section, shall be entitled to occupy and use as a homesite for his lifetime a reasonable acreage of such lands, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, subject to such regulations as the Secretary of Agriculture may issue to safeguard the administration of the national forest and as the Secretary of the Interior may issue to safeguard the administration of the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(h) Administration of outstanding timber sales contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If title to any of the lands comprising the Klamath Indian Forest is taken by the United States, the administration of any outstanding timber sales contracts thereon entered into by the Secretary of the Interior as trustee for the Klamath Indians shall be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(i) Right of United States to use roads</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All sales of tribal lands pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or pursuant to section 564d of this title on which roads are located shall be made subject to the right of the United States and its assigns to maintain and use such roads.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Full agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, within one hundred and eighty days after the first session scheduled by the Mediator under section 640d&ndash;1(c) of this title, full agreement is reached, such agreement shall be put in such form as the Mediator determines best expresses the intent of the tribes and shall then be submitted to the Secretary and the Attorney General of the United States for their comments as they relate to the interest of the United States in the proceedings. These comments are to be submitted to the Mediator and the negotiating teams within thirty days. The negotiating teams and the Mediator shall then consider the comments and, if agreement can still be reached on terms acceptable to the negotiating teams and the Mediator within sixty days of receipt by him of the comments, the agreement shall be put in final written form and shall be <!-- PDFPage:249 -->signed by the members of the negotiating teams and the Mediator. The Mediator shall then cause the agreement to be entered into the records of the supplemental proceedings in the Healing case. The provisions of the agreement shall be reviewed by the District Court, modified where necessary, and put into effect immediately thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Partial agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, within the one hundred and eighty day period referred to in subsection (a) of this section, a partial agreement has been reached between the tribes and they wish such partial agreement to go into effect, they shall follow the procedure set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The partial agreement shall then be considered by the Mediator in preparing his report, and the District Court in making a final adjudication, pursuant to section 640d&ndash;3 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consistency with existing law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, the negotiating teams may make any provision in the agreement or partial agreement not inconsistent with existing law. No such agreement or any provision in it shall result in a taking by the United States of private property compensable under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Mediator in preparing his report, and the District Court in making the final adjudication, pursuant to section 640d&ndash;3 of this title, shall consider and be guided by the decision of the Healing case, under which the tribes have joint, undivided, and equal interests in and to all of the joint use area; by any partial agreement reached by the parties under section 640d&ndash;2(b) of this title; by the last best offer for a complete settlement as a part of the negotiating process by each of the tribes; and by the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The rights and interests, as defined in the Healing case, of the Hopi Tribe in and to that portion of the reservation established by the Executive order of December 16, 1882, which is <!-- PDFPage:250 -->known as land management district no. 6 (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Hopi Reservation&rdquo;) shall not be reduced or limited in any manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The boundary lines resulting from any partitioning of lands in the joint use area shall be established so as to include the higher density population areas of each tribe within the portion of the lands partitioned to such tribe to minimize and avoid undue social, economic, and cultural disruption insofar as practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In any division of the surface rights to the joint use area, reasonable provision shall be made for the use of and right of access to identified religious shrines for the members of each tribe on the reservation of the other tribe where such use and access are for religious purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any partition of the surface rights to the joint use area, the lands shall, insofar as is practicable, be equal in acreage and quality: <em>Provided</em>, That if such partition results in a lesser amount of acreage, or value, or both to one tribe such differential shall be fully and finally compensable to such tribe by the other tribe. The value of the land for the purposes of this subsection shall be based on not less than its value with improvements and its grazing capacity fully restored: <em>Provided further</em>, That, in the determination of compensation for any such differential, the Federal Government shall pay any difference between the value of the particular land involved in its existing state and the value of such land in a fully restored state which results from damage to the land which the District Court finds attributable to a failure of the Federal Government to provide protection where such protection is or was required by law or by the demands of the trust relationship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any lands partitioned to each tribe in the joint use area shall, where feasible and consistent with the other provisions of this section, be contiguous to the reservation of each such tribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any boundary line between lands partitioned to the two tribes in the joint use area shall, insofar as is practicable, follow terrain which will facilitate fencing or avoid the need for fencing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any claim the Hopi Tribe may have against the Navajo Tribe for an accounting of all sums collected by the Navajo Tribe since September 17, 1957, as trader license fees or commissions, lease rental, or proceeds, or other similar charges for doing business or for damages in the use of lands within the joint use area, shall be for a one-half share in such sums.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any claim the Hopi Tribe may have against the Navajo Tribe for the determination and recovery of the fair value of the grazing and agricultural use of the lands within the joint use area by the Navajo Tribe and its individual members, since September 28, 1962, shall be for one-half of such value.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Either tribe, acting through the chairman of its tribal council for and on behalf of the tribe, is each hereby authorized to commence or defend in the District Court an action against the other tribe and any other tribe of Indians claiming any interest in or to the area described in the Act of June 14, 1934, except the reservation established by the Executive Order of December 16, 1882, for the purpose of determining the rights and interests of the tribes in and to such lands and quieting title thereto in the tribes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of land to respective reservations upon determination of interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Lands, if any, in which the Navajo Tribe or Navajo individuals are determined by the District Court to have the exclusive interest shall continue to be a part of the Navajo Reservation. Lands, if any, in which the Hopi Tribe, including any Hopi village or clan thereof, or Hopi individuals are determined by the District Court to have the exclusive interest shall thereafter be a reservation for the Hopi Tribe. Any lands in which the Navajo and Hopi Tribes or Navajo or Hopi individuals are determined to have a joint or undivided interest shall be partitioned by the District Court on the basis of fairness and equity and the area so partitioned shall be retained in the Navajo Reservation or added to the Hopi Reservation, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions for accounting, fair value of grazing, and claims for damages to land; determination of recovery; defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Either as a part of or in a proceeding supplementary to the action authorized in subsection (a) of this section, either tribe, through the chairman of its tribal council for and on behalf of the tribe, including all villages, clans, and individual members thereof, may prosecute or defend an action for the types of relief, including interest, specified in section 640d&ndash;17 of this title, including all subsections thereof, against the other tribe, through its tribal chairman in a like representative capacity, and against the United States as to the types of recovery specified in subsection (a)(3) of section 640d&ndash;17 of this title and subject to the same provisions as contained in said subsection, such action to apply to the lands in issue in the reservation established by the Act of June 14, 1934 (48 Stat. 960).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event the Hopi Tribe or Navajo Tribe is determined to have any interest in the lands in issue, the right of either tribe to recover hereunder shall be based upon that percentage of the total sums collected, use made, waste committed, and other amounts of recovery, <!-- PDFPage:251 -->which is equal to the percentage of lands in issue in which either tribe is determined to have such interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Neither laches nor the statute of limitations shall constitute a defense to such proceedings if they are either prosecuted as a part of the action authorized by this section or in a proceeding supplemental thereto, if instituted not later than twenty-four months following a final order of partition and exhaustion of appeals in an action filed pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Denial of Congressional interest in merits of conflicting claims; liability of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be deemed to be a Congressional determination of the merits of the conflicting claims to the lands that are subject to adjudication pursuant to this section, or to affect the liability of the United States, if any, under litigation now pending before the Indian Claims Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of legal fees, court costs and other expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to pay any or all appropriate legal fees, court costs, and other related expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the commencing of, or defending against, any action brought by the Navajo, San Juan Southern Paiute or Hopi Tribe under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Provision of attorney fees for San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any funds made available for the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe to pay for attorney's fees shall be paid directly to the tribe's attorneys of record until such tribe is acknowledged as an Indian tribe by the United States: <em>Provided</em>, That the tribe's eligibility for such payments shall cease once a decision by the Secretary of the Interior declining to acknowledge such tribe becomes final and no longer appealable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as a congressional acknowledgement of the San Juan Southern Paiute as an Indian tribe or as affecting in any way the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe's Petition for Recognition currently pending with the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) There is hereby authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $250,000 to pay for the legal expenses incurred by the Southern Paiute Tribe on legal action arising under this section prior to November 16, 1988.</p>

So long as selected lands coincide with pending noncompetitive coal lease applications under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, the Secretary may not transfer any United States interests in such lands until the noncompetitive coal lease applications have been fully adjudicated. If such adjudication results in issuance of Federal coal leases to the applicants, such transfer shall be subject to such leases. The leaseholders rights and interests in such coal leases will in no way be diminished by the transfer of the rights, title and interests of the United States in such lands to the Navajo Tribe.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Acquisition of title to surface and subsurface interest; time period; public notice; report to Congressional committees; rights of subsurface owner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For a period of three years after July 8, 1980, the Secretary shall not accept title to lands acquired pursuant to subsection (a)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#640d-10_4_target" name="640d-10_4">4</a></sup> of this section unless fee title to both surface and subsurface has been acquired or the owner of the subsurface interest consents to the acceptance of the surface interest in trust by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Lands not available for transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No public lands lying north and west of the Colorado River in the State of Arizona shall be available for transfer under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior, under such regulations as he may prescribe, is authorized and directed to revise the roll of the Indians of California, as defined in section 651 of this title, which was approved by him on May 16, 1933, in the following particulars: (a) By adding to said roll the names of persons who filed applications for enrollment as Indians of California on or before May 18, 1932, and who, although determined to be descendants of the Indians residing in the State of California on June 1, 1852, were denied enrollment solely on the ground that they were not living in the State of California on May 18, 1928, and who were alive on May 24, 1950; (b) by adding to said roll the names of persons who are descendants of the Indians residing in the State of California on June 1, 1852, and who are the fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, uncles, or aunts of persons whose names appear on said roll, and who were alive on May 24, 1950, irrespective of whether such fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, uncles, or aunts were living in the State of California on May 18, 1928; (c) by adding to said roll the names of persons born since May 18, 1928, and living on May 24, 1950, who are the children or other descendants of persons whose names appear on said roll, or of persons whose names are eligible for addition to said roll under clauses (a) or (b) of this section, or of persons dying prior to May 24, 1950, whose names would have been eligible for addition to said roll under clauses (a) or (b) of this section if such persons had been alive on May 24, 1950; and (d) by removing from said roll the names of persons who have died since May 18, 1928, and prior to May 24, 1950. Persons entitled to enrollment under clause (a) of this section shall be enrolled by the Secretary of the Interior without further application. Persons claiming to be entitled to enrollment under clauses (b) or (c) of this section shall, within one year after May 24, 1950, make an application in writing to the Secretary of the Interior for enrollment, unless they have previously filed such an application under this section. For the purposes of clause (d) of this section, when the Secretary of the Interior is satisfied that reasonable and diligent efforts have been made to locate a person whose name is on said roll and that such person cannot be located, he may presume that such person died prior to May 24, 1950, and his presumption shall be conclusive. The Secretary of the Interior shall prepare not less than five hundred copies of an alphabetical list of the Indians of California whose names appear on the roll approved on May 16, 1933, giving the name, address, and age at time of enrollment of each such enrollee, together with such other factual information, if any, as the Secretary may deem advisable as tending to identify each enrollee, and shall distribute copies of this list to the various communities of California Indians. The Indians of California in each community may elect a committee of three enrollees who may aid the enrolling agent in any matters relating to the revision of said roll. After the expiration of the period allowed by this section for filing applications, the Secretary of the Interior shall have until June 30, 1955, to approve and promulgate the revised roll of the Indians of California provided for in this section. Upon such approval and promulgation, the roll shall be closed and thereafter no additional names shall be added thereto.</p>

The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to withdraw from the fund on deposit in the Treasury of the United States arising from the judgment in favor of the Indians of California entered by the Court of Claims on December 4, 1944, and appropriated for them by section 203 of the Act of April 25, 1945 (59 Stat. 77), such sums as may be necessary to make the per capita payments required by this section, including not to exceed $15,000 for the purpose of defraying the expenses incident to carrying out the provisions of sections 657 and 658 of this title. Such payments shall be made out of the accumulated interest on such judgment fund and so much of the principal thereof as is necessary to complete the payments.

<p class="statutory-body">The tribal business committee representing the full-blood group, and the authorized representatives of the mixed-blood group, within sixty days after the publication of the final membership roll, as provided in section 677g of this title, shall commence a division of the assets of the tribe that are then susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution. Such division shall be by agreement between them subject to the approval of the Secretary. Said division shall be based upon the relative number of persons comprising the final membership roll of each group. After such division the rights or beneficial interests in tribal property of each mixed-blood person whose name appears on the roll shall constitute an undivided interest in and to such property which may be inherited or bequeathed, but shall be subject to alienation or encumbrance before the transfer of title to such tribal property only as provided herein. Any contract made in violation of this section shall be null and void. If said groups are unable to agree upon said division within a period of twelve months from the date of such commencement, or any authorized extension of said period granted within the discretion of the Secretary, the Secretary is authorized to partition the assets of the tribe in such manner as in his opinion will be equitable and fair to both groups. Such partition shall give rise to no cause of action against the United States and the costs of such partition shall be paid by the tribe. The Secretary is authorized to provide such reasonable assistance as may be requested by both groups, or by either group, in formulation and execution of a plan for the division of said assets, including necessary technical services of Government employees at Fort Duchesne, Utah, and arranging for necessary consultations with representatives of Federal departments and agencies, officials of the State of Utah, and political subdivisions thereof, and members of the tribe. All unadjudicated or unliquidated claims against the United States, all gas, oil, and mineral rights of every kind, and all other assets not susceptible to equitable and practicable distribution shall be managed jointly by the Tribal Business Committee and the authorized representatives of the mixed-blood group, subject to such supervision by the Secretary as is otherwise required by law, and the net proceeds therefrom after deducting the costs chargeable to such management shall first be divided between the full-blood and mixed-blood groups in direct proportion to the number of persons comprising the final membership roll of each group and without regard to the number of persons comprising each group at the time of the division of such proceeds.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">After the adoption of a plan for the division of the assets between the two groups, a plan for distribution of the assets of the mixed-blood group to the individual members thereof shall be prepared and ratified by a majority of said group, within the period of six months from such adoption and presented to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary is authorized to provide such reasonable assistance, including necessary technical service of Government employees at Fort Duchesne, Utah, and arranging for necessary consultations with representatives of Federal departments and agencies, officials of the State of Utah and political subdivisions thereof, as may be required by the mixed-blood group in the preparation of such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan for division of the assets among the members of the mixed-blood group may include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Complete disposition of all cash assets of said group, reserving, however, sufficient funds to cover&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the proportionate share of said mixed-blood group in and to all expenses incurred in effecting the purposes of this subchapter, including, but not limited to, the necessary expense incurred under this section and section 677m of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the just and proportionate share of the mixed-bloods in the expense incurred in the prosecution of the claims of the tribe, or the bands thereof, against the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the determinable and estimated administrative costs and expenses of any mixed-blood organization authorized by this subchapter, including lawful and reasonable salaries and fees of authorized agents, officers and employees of said mixed-blood group.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Partition of the lands of the mixed-blood group, excepting all gas, oil, and mineral rights, to corporations, partnerships, or other legal entities, and to trustees, and the individual members of said groups, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to the respective rights and interests of the parties, located so as to embrace, as far as practicable, any improvements lawfully made by the person or persons receiving such land. The value of the improvements made, under a valid lease or assignment from the tribe, shall be excluded from the valuation in making allotments to the lessee or assignee, and the land must be valued without regard to such improvements unless the lease or assignment, under which said improvements were made, provided that such improvements should become the property of the tribe. In the making of any partition due consideration shall be given to all of the rights and interests of the person or persons receiving the property, and all of the rights and interests of the other members of the tribe. Two or more of the members of said mixed-blood group may obtain their share of property as tenants in common, as joint tenants, or in any other lawful manner when such members agree among themselves as to the manner in which they desire to receive such title. When it appears that an equitable partition cannot be made among the members of said mixed-blood group without prejudice to the rights and interests of some of them, and yet a partition is directed by the group, the members of said group may voluntarily determine compensation to be made by one party to another on account of the inequity. In all cases where equity is agreed upon by the members of said mixed-blood group, such compensatory adjustment among the parties, according to the principles of equity, must be approved by the Secretary. In the event of a failure to agree upon an equitable compensatory adjustment among the parties the Secretary shall make such adjustment and his decision shall be final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Organization of corporations for the grazing of livestock, handling of water and water rights, and the shares therein may be issued to the members of said group in proportion to their interests in the assets of such corporations. When, in the opinion of said mixed-blood group, it is to the best interest of said group to transfer a portion of the assets of said group to a corporation or other legal entity for any purpose, the Secretary is authorized to make such transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A transfer of assets to one or more trustees designated by said group who shall hold title to all or any part of the property of said group for management or liquidation purposes under terms and conditions prescribed by said mixed-blood group. The Secretary is authorized to make such transfer, and approve the trustees, and the terms and conditions of the trust.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:279 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Sale of any portion of the assets of said group subject to the approval of the Secretary. In addition to the sales herein otherwise authorized, authority is granted to the authorized representatives of said group to sell any property of said group when, in the opinion of the majority of said mixed-blood group, a practicable partition cannot be made, or for any other reason it is deemed to the best interests of the group, and the proceeds of such sales shall be distributed equitably among the members of said mixed-blood group; after deducting reasonable cost of sale and distribution.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;941. Declaration of policy, Congressional findings and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares and finds that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to support the resolution of disputes over historical claims through settlements mutually agreed to by Indian and non-Indian parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There is pending before the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina a lawsuit disputing ownership of approximately 140,000 acres of land in the State of South Carolina and other rights of the Catawba Indian Tribe under Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Catawba Indian Tribe initiated a related lawsuit against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Some of the significant historical events which have led to the present situation include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In treaties with the Crown in 1760 and 1763, the Tribe ceded vast portions of its aboriginal territory in the present States of North and South Carolina in return for guarantees of being quietly settled on a 144,000-acre reservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Tribe's district court suit contended that in 1840 the Tribe and the State entered into an agreement without Federal approval or participation whereby the Tribe ceded its treaty reservation to the State, thereby giving rise to the Tribe's claim that it was dispossessed of its lands in violation of Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) In 1943, the United States entered into an agreement with the Tribe and the State to provide services to the Tribe and its members. The State purchased 3,434 acres of land and conveyed it to the Secretary in trust for the Tribe and the Tribe organized under the Indian Reorganization Act [25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) In 1959, when Congress enacted the Catawba Tribe of South Carolina Division of Assets Act (25 U.S.C. 931&ndash;938), Federal agents assured the Tribe that if the Tribe would release the Government from its obligation under the 1943 agreement and agree to Federal legislation terminating the Federal trust relationship and liquidating the 1943 reservation, the status of the Tribe's land claim would not be jeopardized by termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) In 1980, the Tribe initiated Federal court litigation to regain possession of its treaty lands and in 1986, the United States Supreme Court ruled in South Carolina against Catawba Indian Tribe that the 1959 Act resulted in the application of State statutes of limitations to the Tribe's land claim. Two subsequent decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit have held that some portion of the Tribe's claim is barred by State statutes of limitations and that some portion is not barred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The pendency of these lawsuits has led to substantial economic and social hardship for a large number of landowners, citizens and communities in the State of South Carolina, including the Catawba Indian Tribe. Congress recognizes that if these claims are not resolved, further litigation against tens of thousands of landowners would be likely; that any final resolution of pending disputes through a process of litigation would take many years and entail great expenses to all parties; continue economically and socially damaging controversies; prolong uncertainty as to the ownership of property; and seriously impair long-term economic planning and development for all parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The 102d Congress has enacted legislation suspending until October 1, 1993, the running of any unexpired statute of limitation applicable to the Tribe's land claim in order to provide additional time to negotiate settlement of these claims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) It is recognized that both Indian and non-Indian parties enter into this settlement to resolve the disputes raised in these lawsuits and to derive certain benefits. The parties&rsquo; Settlement Agreement constitutes a good faith effort to resolve these lawsuits and other claims and requires implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States, the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina, and the governing bodies of the South Carolina counties of York and Lancaster.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:328 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To advance the goals of the Federal policy of Indian self-determination and restoration of terminated Indian Tribes, and in recognition of the United States obligation to the Tribe and the Federal policy of settling historical Indian claims through comprehensive settlement agreements, it is appropriate that the United States participate in the funding and implementation of the Settlement Agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to receive from the State, by such transfer document as the Secretary and the State shall approve, all rights, title, and interests of the State in and to the Existing Reservation to be held by the United States as trustee for the Tribe, and, effective on the date of such transfer, the obligation of the State as trustee for the Tribe with respect to such land shall cease.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Expanded Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Existing Reservation shall be expanded in the manner prescribed by the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 180 days following October 27, 1993, the Secretary, after consulting with the Tribe, shall ascertain the boundaries and area of the existing reservation.<sup><a href="#941j_1_target" name="941j_1">1</a></sup> In addition, the Secretary, after consulting with the Tribe, shall engage a professional land planning firm as provided in the Settlement Agreement. The Secretary shall bear the cost of all services rendered pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Tribe may identify, purchase and request that the Secretary place into reservation status, tracts of lands in the manner prescribed by the Settlement Agreement. The Tribe may not request that any land be placed in reservation status, unless those lands were acquired by the Tribe and qualify for reservation status in full compliance with the Settlement Agreement, including section 14 thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall bear the cost of all title examinations, preliminary subsurface soil investigations, and level one environmental audits to be performed on each parcel contemplated for purchase by the Tribe or the Secretary for the Expanded Reservation, and shall report the results to the Tribe. The Secretary's or the Tribe's payment of any option fee and the purchase price may be drawn from the Catawba Land Acquisition Trust Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The total area of the Expanded Reservation shall be limited to 3,000 acres, including the Existing Reservation, but the Tribe may exclude from this limit up to 600 acres of additional land under the conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Non-contiguous tracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Tribe, in consultation with the Secretary, shall take such actions as are reasonable to expand the Existing Reservation by assembling a composite tract of contiguous parcels that border and surround the Existing Reservation. Before requesting that any non-contiguous tract be placed in Reservation status, the Tribe shall comply with section 14 of the Settlement Agreement. Upon the approval of the Tribe's application under and in accordance with section 14 of <!-- PDFPage:337 -->the Settlement Agreement, the Secretary, in consultation with the Tribe, may proceed to place non-contiguous tracts in Reservation status. No purchases of non-contiguous tracts shall be made for the Reservation except as set forth in the Settlement Agreement and the State Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section and the provisions of sections 3113 and 3114(a) to (d) of title 40, the Secretary or the Tribe may acquire a fractional interest in land otherwise qualifying under section 14 of the Settlement Agreement for treatment as Reservation land for the benefit of the Tribe from the ostensible owner of the land if the Secretary or the Tribe and the ostensible owner have agreed upon the identity of the land to be sold and upon the purchase price and other terms of sale. If the ostensible owner agrees to the sale, the Secretary may use condemnation proceedings to perfect or clear title and to acquire any interests of putative co-tenants whose address is unknown or the interests of unknown or unborn heirs or persons subject to mental disability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Terms and conditions of acquisition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All properties acquired by the Tribe shall be acquired subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement. The Tribe and the Secretary, acting on behalf of the Tribe and with its consent, are also authorized to acquire Reservation and non-Reservation lands using the methods of financing described in the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authority to erect permanent improvements on Existing and Expanded Reservation land and non-Reservation land held in trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, the Attorney General of the United States shall approve any deed or other instrument which conveys to the United States lands purchased pursuant to the provisions of this section and the Settlement Agreement. The Secretary or the Tribe may erect permanent improvements of a substantial value, or any other improvements authorized by law on such land after such land is conveyed to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Easements over Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The acquisition of lands for the Expanded Reservation shall not extinguish any easements or rights-of-way then encumbering such lands unless the Secretary or the Tribe enters into a written agreement with the owners terminating such easements or rights-of-way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Tribe, with the approval of the Secretary, shall have the power to grant or convey easements and rights-of-way, in a manner consistent with the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Unless the Tribe and the State agree upon a valuation formula for pricing easements over the Reservation, the Secretary shall be subject to proceedings for condemnation and eminent domain to acquire easements and rights of way for public purposes through the Reservation under the laws of the State in circumstances where no other reasonable access is available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) With the approval of the Tribe, the Secretary may grant easements or rights-of-way over the Reservation for private purposes, and implied easements of necessity shall apply to all lands acquired by the Tribe, unless expressly excluded by the parties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Jurisdictional status</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">All acquisitions of contiguous land to expand the Reservation or of non-contiguous lands to be placed in Reservation status shall be completed or under contract of purchase within 10 years from the date the last payment is made into the Land Acquisition Trust; except that for a period of 20 years after the date the last payment is made into the Catawba Land Acquisition Trust Fund, the Tribe may, subject to the limitation on the total size of the Reservation, continue to add parcels to up to two Reservation areas so long as the parcels acquired are contiguous to one of those two Reservation areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Leases of Reservation lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of section 415 of this title shall not apply to the Tribe and its Reservation. The Tribe is authorized to lease its Reservation lands for terms up to but not exceeding 99 years, with or without the approval of the Secretary. With regard to any lease of Reservation lands not approved by the Secretary, the Secretary shall be exculpated by the Tribe from any liability arising out of any loss incurred by the Tribe as a result of the unapproved lease.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Act was enacted in response to litigation in Federal courts in Segundo, et al. v. United States, 123 F. Supp. 554 (1954);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the case referred to in paragraph (2) was appealed under the case name United States v.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Cherokee Shawnees, also known as the Loyal Shawnees, are recognized as the descendants of the Shawnee Tribe which was incorporated into the Cherokee Nation of Indians of Oklahoma pursuant to an agreement entered into by and between the Shawnee Tribe and the Cherokee Nation on June 7, 1869, and approved by the President on June 9, 1869, in accordance with Article XV of the July 19, 1866, Treaty between the United States and the Cherokee Nation (14 Stat. 799).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Shawnee Tribe from and after its incorporation and its merger with the Cherokee Nation has continued to maintain the Shawnee Tribe's separate culture, language, religion, and organization, and a separate membership roll.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Shawnee Tribe and the Cherokee Nation have concluded that it is in the best interests of the Shawnee Tribe and the Cherokee Nation that the Shawnee Tribe be restored to its position as a separate federally recognized Indian tribe and all current and historical responsibilities, jurisdiction, and sovereignty as it relates to the Shawnee Tribe, the Cherokee-Shawnee people, and their properties everywhere, provided that civil and criminal jurisdiction over Shawnee individually owned restricted and trust lands, Shawnee tribal trust lands, dependent Indian communities, and all other forms of Indian country within the jurisdictional territory of the Cherokee Nation and located within the State of Oklahoma shall remain with the Cherokee Nation, unless consent is obtained by the Shawnee Tribe from the Cherokee Nation to assume all or any portion of such jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) On August 12, 1996, the Tribal Council of the Cherokee Nation unanimously adopted Resolution 96&ndash;09 supporting the termination by the Secretary of the Interior of the 1869 Agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) On July 23, 1996, the Shawnee Tribal Business Committee concurred in such resolution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) On March 13, 2000, a second resolution was adopted by the Tribal Council of the Cherokee Nation (Resolution 15&ndash;00) supporting the submission of this legislation to Congress for enactment.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1300b&ndash;11. Congressional findings and declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that the Texas Band of Kickapoo Indians is a subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; that many years ago, the Band was forced to migrate from its ancestral lands to what is now the State of Texas and the nation of Mexico; that, although many members of the band&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1300b-11_1_target" name="1300b-11_1">1</a></sup> meet the requirements for United States citizenship, some of them cannot prove that they are United States citizens; that, although the Band resides in the State of Texas, it owns no land there; that, because the Band owns no land in Texas, members of the Band are considered ineligible for services which the United States provides to other Indians who are members of federally recognized tribes because of their status as Indians except when the members of the Band are on or near the reservation of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; that members of the Band live under conditions that pose serious threats to their health; and that, because their culture is derived from three different cultures, they have unique needs including, especially, educational needs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declarations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress therefore declares that the Band should be recognized by the United States; that the right of the members of the Band to pass and repass the borders of the United States should be clarified; that services which the United States provides to Indians because of their status as Indians should be provided to members of the Band in Maverick County, Texas; and, that land in the State of Texas should be taken in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Band.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, although currently recognized by the Federal Government as part of the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, has historically existed, and continues to exist, as a separate and distinct Indian tribe that is located over 75 miles from the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Lac Vieux Desert Band consists of approximately 250 members who continue to reside close to their ancestral homeland near the town of Watersmeet, Michigan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Lac Vieux Desert Band entered into two treaties with the United States as a distinct tribal entity (7 Stat. 591, 10 Stat. 1109);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) members of the Lac Vieux Desert Band currently reside on or otherwise occupy lands within the Township of Watersmeet, Michigan, which are held by the United States in trust for the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, and currently receive limited Federal benefits through the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) because of its distance from Keweenaw Bay and the failure of the United States to recognize the independent status of the tribe, the Lac Vieux Desert Band and its members receive only limited benefits to which the tribe and its members are entitled.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1300j. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians is the descendant of, and political successor to, the signatories of the Treaty of Greenville 1795 (7 Stat. 49); the Treaty of Grouseland 1805 (7 Stat. 91); the Treaty of Spring Wells 1815 (7 Stat. 131); the Treaty of the Rapids of the Miami of Lake Erie 1817 (7 Stat. 160); the Treaty of St. Mary's 1818 (7 Stat. 185); the Treaty of Chicago 1821 (7 Stat. 218); the Treaty of the Mississinewa on the Wabash 1826 (7 Stat. 295); the Treaty of St. Joseph 1827 (7 Stat. 305); the Treaty of St. Joseph 1828 (7 Stat. 317); the Treaty of Tippecanoe River 1832 (7 Stat. 399); and the Treaty of Chicago 1833 (7 Stat. 431).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the Treaty of Chicago 1833, the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians was the only band that negotiated a right to remain in Michigan. The other Potawatomi bands relinquished all lands in Michigan and were required to move to Kansas or Iowa.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Two of the Potawatomi bands later returned to the Great Lakes area, the Forest County Potawatomi of Wisconsin and the Hannahville Indian Community of Michigan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Hannahville Indian Community of Michigan, the Forest County Potawatomi Community of Wisconsin, the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians of Kansas, and the Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, whose members are also descendants of the signatories to one or more of the aforementioned treaties, have been recognized by the Federal Government as Indian tribes eligible to receive services from the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Beginning in 1935, the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians petitioned for reorganization and assistance pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq., commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Indian Reorganization Act&rdquo;). Because of the financial condition of the Federal Government during the Great Depression it relied upon the State of Michigan to provide services to the Pokagon Band. Other Potawatomi bands, including the Forest County Potawatomi and the Hannahville Indian Community were provided services pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Agents of the Federal Government in 1939 made an administrative decision not to provide services or extend the benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act [25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.] to any Indian tribes in Michigan's lower peninsula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Tribes elsewhere, including the Hannahville Indian Community in Michigan's upper peninsula, received services from the Federal Government and were extended the benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act [25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.].</p>
<!-- PDFPage:397 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians consists of at least 1,500 members who continue to reside close to their ancestral homeland in the St. Joseph River Valley in southwestern Michigan and northern Indiana.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) In spite of the denial of the right to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act [25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.], the Pokagon Band has continued to carry out its governmental functions through a Business Committee and Tribal Council from treaty times until today.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The United States Government, the government of the State of Michigan, and local governments have had continuous dealings with the recognized political leaders of the Band from 1795 until the present.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians are descendants of, and political successors to, signatories of the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty of Detroit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, and the Bay Mills Band of Chippewa Indians, whose members are also descendants of the signatories to the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty of Detroit, have been recognized by the Federal Government as distinct Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians consists of at least 1,000 eligible members who continue to reside close to their ancestral homeland as recognized in the Little Traverse Reservation in the 1836 Treaty of Washington and 1855 Treaty of Detroit, which area is now known as Emmet and Charlevoix Counties, Michigan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Little River Band of Ottawa Indians consists of at least 500 eligible members who continue to reside close to their ancestral homeland as recognized in the Manistee Reservation in the 1836 Treaty of Washington and reservation in the 1855 Treaty of Detroit, which area is now known as Manistee and Mason Counties, Michigan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Bands filed for reorganization of their existing tribal governments in 1935 under the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.; commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Indian Reorganization Act&rdquo;). Federal agents who visited the Bands, including Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier, attested to the continued social and political existence of the Bands and concluded that the Bands were eligible for reorganization. Due to a lack of Federal appropriations to implement the provisions of such Act, the Bands were denied the opportunity to reorganize.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In spite of such denial, the Bands continued their political and social existence with viable tribal governments. The Bands, along with other Michigan Odawa/Ottawa groups, including the tribes described in paragraph (2), formed the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association in 1948. The Association subsequently pursued a successful land claim with the Indian Claims Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Between 1948 and 1975, the Bands carried out many of their governmental functions through the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association, while retaining individual Band control over local decisions.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:399 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) In 1975, the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association petitioned under the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.; commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Indian Reorganization Act&rdquo;), to form a government on behalf of the Bands. Again in spite of the Bands&rsquo; eligibility, the Bureau of Indian Affairs failed to act on their request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The United States Government, the government of the State of Michigan, and local governments have had continuous dealings with the recognized political leaders of the Bands from 1836 to the present.</p>
