<p class="statutory-body">The sum of $5,671,156 from the funds credited to the Blackfeet Tribe under section 1261 of this title shall be distributed per capita to each person whose name appears on or is entitled to appear on the membership roll of the Blackfeet Tribe, and who was born on or prior to and is living on March 18, 1972. The sum of $2,100,000 from the funds credited to the Gros Ventre Tribe under section 1261 of this title shall be distributed per capita to all members of the Fort Belknap Community who were born on or prior to and are living on March 18, 1972, and (a) whose names appear on the February 5, 1937, payment roll of the Gros Ventre Tribe of the Fort Belknap Reservation, or (b) who are descended from a person whose name appears on said roll, if such member possesses a greater degree of Gros Ventre blood than Assiniboine blood. If such member possesses equal quantums of Gros Ventre and Assiniboine blood he may elect to participate in the per capita distribution authorized by this section, in which event he shall not be eligible to participate in any per capita distribution of an Assiniboine judgment. A share or interest payable to enrollees or their heirs or legatees who are less than eighteen years of age or under legal disability shall be paid in accordance with such procedures, including the establishment of trusts, as the Secretary determines appropriate to protect the best interest of such persons.</p>
