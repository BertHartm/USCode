Such proposed constitution and bylaws shall be adopted by the Interim Council no later than six months after November 22, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the adoption of the proposed tribal constitution and bylaws by the Interim Council, the Council shall request the Secretary, in writing, to schedule an election to approve or disapprove the adoption of such constitution and bylaws.

The members of the Interim Council may freely consult with members of the tribe concerning the text and description of the constitution and bylaws, except that such consultation may not be carried on within fifty feet of the polling places on the date of such election.</p>
