<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2001. Standards for basic education of Indian children in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of the standards developed under this section shall be to afford Indian students being served by a Bureau funded school with the same opportunities as all other students to achieve the National Education Goals embodied in the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.]. Consistent with the provisions of this section and section 2011 of this title, the Secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to coordinate standards developed and implemented under this section with those in the State improvement plans developed and implemented pursuant to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act for the States in which each Bureau funded school operates. In developing and reviewing such standards and coordination, the Secretary shall utilize the findings and recommendations of the panel established in section 315(b)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2001_1_target" name="2001_1">1</a></sup> of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall take immediate steps to encourage school boards of Bureau funded schools to engage their communities in adopting declarations of purposes of education in their communities, analyzing the implications of such purposes for their schools, and determining how such purposes may be made to motivate students and faculties and otherwise animate their schools by May 1, 1995. Such declarations shall represent the aspirations of a community for the kinds of persons such community wants its children to increasingly become, and shall include such purposes as assuring that all learners are becoming accomplished in ways important to themselves and respected by their parents and communities, shaping worthwhile and satisfying lives for themselves, exemplifying the best values of the community and humankind, and becoming increasingly effective in shaping the character and quality of the world all learners share.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Studies and surveys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 18 months of the publication of the voluntary national content standards described in section 203(a)(2) of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5823(a)(2)], the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and Indian organizations and tribes, shall carry out or cause to be carried out by contract with an Indian organization such studies and surveys, making the fullest use possible of other existing studies, surveys, and plans, as are necessary to establish and revise standards for the basic education of Indian children attending Bureau funded schools. Such studies and surveys shall take into account factors such as academic needs, local cultural differences, type and level of language skills, geographic isolation, and appropriate teacher-student ratios for such children, and shall be directed toward the attainment of equal educational opportunity for such children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Revision of minimum academic standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall revise the minimum academic standards published in the Federal Register of September 9, 1985 (50 Fed. Reg. 174) for the basic education of Indian children in accordance with the purpose described in subsection (a) of this section and the findings of the studies and surveys described in subsection (b) of this section, and shall publish such revised standards in the Federal Register for the purpose of receiving comments from the tribes and other interested parties. Within 21 months of October 20, 1994, the Secretary shall establish final standards, distribute such standards to all the tribes and publish such final standards in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall revise such final standards periodically as necessary. Prior to any revision of such final standards, the Secretary shall distribute such proposed revision to all the tribes, and publish such proposed revision in the Federal Register, for the purpose of receiving comments from the tribes and other interested parties.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:567 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The standards described in paragraph (1) shall apply to Bureau schools, and subject to subsection (f) of this section, to contract or grant schools, and may also serve as a model for educational programs for Indian children in public schools. In establishing and revising such standards, the Secretary shall take into account the special needs of Indian students and the support and reinforcement of the specific cultural heritage of each tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternative or modified standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide alternative or modified standards in lieu of the standards established under subsection (c) of this section, where necessary, so that the programs of each school shall be in compliance with the minimum standards required for accreditation of schools in the State where the school is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A tribal governing body, or the local school board so designated by the tribal governing body, shall have the local authority to waive, in part or in whole, the standards established under subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2001_2_target" name="2001_2">2</a></sup> (c) and (d) of this section, where such standards are deemed by such body to be inappropriate. The tribal governing body or designated school board shall, within 60 days thereafter, submit to the Secretary a proposal for alternative standards that take into account the specific needs of the tribe's children. Such revised standards shall be established by the Secretary unless specifically rejected by the Secretary for good cause and in writing to the affected tribes or local school board, which rejection shall be final and unreviewable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Implementation of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, through contracting and grant-making procedures, shall assist school boards of contract or grant schools in the implementation of the standards established under subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if the school boards request that such standards, in part or in whole, be implemented. At the request of a contract or grant school board, the Secretary shall provide alternative or modified standards for the standards established under subsections (c) and (d) of this section to take into account the needs of the Indian children and the contract or grant school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 1 year of August 15, 1985, the Bureau shall, either directly or through contract with an Indian organization, establish a consistent system of reporting standards for fiscal control and fund accounting for all contract or grant schools. Such standards shall yield data results comparable to those used by Bureau schools.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Annual plan for meeting of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsections (e) and (f) of this section, the Secretary shall begin to implement the standards established under this section immediately upon the date of their establishment. Not later than January 1, 1995, and at each time thereafter that the annual budget request for Bureau educational services is presented, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a detailed plan to bring all Bureau schools and contract or grant schools up to the level required by the applicable standards established under this section. Such plan shall include detailed information on the status of each school's educational program in relation to the applicable standards established under this section, specific cost estimates for meeting such standards at each school, and specific time lines for bringing each school up to the level required by such standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Closure or consolidation of schools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as specifically required by statute, no school or peripheral dormitory operated by the Bureau on or after January 1, 1992, may be closed or consolidated or have its program substantially curtailed unless done according to the requirements of this subsection, except that, in those cases where the tribal governing body, or the local school board concerned (if so designated by the tribal governing body), requests closure or consolidation, the requirements of this subsection shall not apply. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply when a temporary closure, consolidation, or substantial curtailment is required by plant conditions which constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall, by regulation, promulgate standards and procedures for the closing, consolidation, or substantial curtailment of Bureau schools in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever closure, transfer to any other authority, consolidation, or substantial curtailment of a school is under active consideration or review by any division of the Bureau or the Department of the Interior, the affected tribe, tribal governing body, and designated local school board, will be notified as soon as such consideration or review begins, kept fully and currently informed, and afforded an opportunity to comment with respect to such consideration or review. When a formal decision is made to close, transfer to any other authority, consolidate, or substantially curtail a school, the affected tribe, tribal governing body, and designated local school board shall be notified at least 6 months prior to the end of the school year preceding the proposed closure date. Copies of any such notices and information shall be transmitted promptly to the Congress and published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall make a report to Congress, the affected tribe, and the designated local school board describing the process of the active consideration or review referred to in paragraph (3). At a minimum, the report shall include a study of the impact of such action on the student population, with every effort to identify those students with particular educational and social needs, and to ensure that alternative services are available to such students. Such report shall include the description of the consultation conducted between the potential service provider, current service provider, parents, tribal representative and the tribe or tribes involved, and the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs within the Bureau regarding such students. No irreversible action may be taken in furtherance of any such <!-- PDFPage:568 -->proposed school closure, transfer to any other authority, consolidation, or substantial curtailment (including any action which would prejudice the personnel or programs of such school) until the end of the first full academic year after such report is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may terminate, contract, transfer to any other authority, or consolidate or substantially curtail the operation or facilities of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any Bureau funded school that is operated on or after April 1, 1987,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any Bureau school (subject to the approval of the school board of such school);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any school board of a school operating under a contract entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any school board of a school operating under a grant under the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 [25 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.].</p>
<br class="Q04" />
