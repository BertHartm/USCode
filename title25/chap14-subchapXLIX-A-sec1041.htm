<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Cherokee Shawnees, also known as the Loyal Shawnees, are recognized as the descendants of the Shawnee Tribe which was incorporated into the Cherokee Nation of Indians of Oklahoma pursuant to an agreement entered into by and between the Shawnee Tribe and the Cherokee Nation on June 7, 1869, and approved by the President on June 9, 1869, in accordance with Article XV of the July 19, 1866, Treaty between the United States and the Cherokee Nation (14 Stat. 799).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Shawnee Tribe from and after its incorporation and its merger with the Cherokee Nation has continued to maintain the Shawnee Tribe's separate culture, language, religion, and organization, and a separate membership roll.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Shawnee Tribe and the Cherokee Nation have concluded that it is in the best interests of the Shawnee Tribe and the Cherokee Nation that the Shawnee Tribe be restored to its position as a separate federally recognized Indian tribe and all current and historical responsibilities, jurisdiction, and sovereignty as it relates to the Shawnee Tribe, the Cherokee-Shawnee people, and their properties everywhere, provided that civil and criminal jurisdiction over Shawnee individually owned restricted and trust lands, Shawnee tribal trust lands, dependent Indian communities, and all other forms of Indian country within the jurisdictional territory of the Cherokee Nation and located within the State of Oklahoma shall remain with the Cherokee Nation, unless consent is obtained by the Shawnee Tribe from the Cherokee Nation to assume all or any portion of such jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) On August 12, 1996, the Tribal Council of the Cherokee Nation unanimously adopted Resolution 96&ndash;09 supporting the termination by the Secretary of the Interior of the 1869 Agreement.</p>
