<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To such extent or in such amounts as provided in appropriations Acts, the Secretary may, subject to the limitations of this subchapter (including limitations designed to protect and maintain the viability of rental housing units owned or operated by the recipient that were developed under a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.]), and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, guarantee and make commitments to guarantee, the notes or other obligations issued by Indian tribes or tribally designated housing entities with tribal approval, for the purposes of financing affordable housing activities described in section 4132 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Lack of financing elsewhere</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A guarantee under this subchapter may be used to assist an Indian tribe or housing entity in obtaining financing only if the Indian tribe or housing entity has made efforts to obtain such financing without the use of such guarantee and cannot complete such financing consistent with the timely execution of the program plans without such guarantee.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:723 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations, have such maturities, and be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary. The Secretary may not deny a guarantee under this subchapter on the basis of the proposed repayment period for the note or other obligation, unless the period is more than 20 years or the Secretary determines that the period causes the guarantee to constitute an unacceptable financial risk.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on outstanding guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall be made with respect to any note or other obligation if the total outstanding notes or obligations of the issuer guaranteed under this subchapter (excluding any amount defeased under the contract entered into under section 4192(a)(1) of this title) would thereby exceed an amount equal to 5 times the amount of the grant approval for the issuer pursuant to subchapter III of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pledge any grant for which the issuer may become eligible under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) demonstrate that the extent of such issuance and guarantee under this subchapter is within the financial capacity of the tribe and is not likely to impair the ability to use grant amounts under subchapter I of this chapter, taking into consideration the requirements under section 4133(b) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) furnish, at the discretion of the Secretary, such other security as may be deemed appropriate by the Secretary in making such guarantees, including increments in local tax receipts generated by the activities assisted under this chapter or disposition proceeds from the sale of land or rehabilitated property.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Full faith and credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under this subchapter.
