<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) among its purposes, the Act entitled &lsquo;An Act to provide for the equalization of allotments on the Agua Caliente (Palm Springs) Reservation in California, and for other purposes&rsquo;, approved September 21, 1959, commonly known as the &lsquo;Agua Caliente Equalization Act of 1959&rsquo; (25 U.S.C. 951 et seq.) (referred to in this section as the &lsquo;Act&rsquo;) was intended to provide for a reasonable degree of equalization of the value of allotments made to members of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Act was enacted in response to litigation in Federal courts in Segundo, et al. v. United States, 123 F. Supp. 554 (1954);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the case referred to in paragraph (2) was appealed under the case name United States v. Pierce, 235 F. 2d 885 (1956) and that case affirmed the entitlement of certain members of the Band to allotments of approximately equal value to lands allotted to other members of the Band;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4)(A) to achieve the equalization referred to in paragraph (3), section 3 of the Act (25 U.S.C. 953) provided for the allotment or sale of all remaining tribal lands, with the exception of several specifically designated parcels, including 2 parcels in the Mineral Springs area known as parcel A and parcel B;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) section 3 of the Act restricted the distribution of any net rents, profits, or other revenues derived from parcel B to members of the Band and their heirs entitled to equalization of the value of the allotments of those members;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) from 1959 through 1984, each annual budget of the Band, as approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, provided for expenditure of all revenues derived from both parcel A and parcel B solely for tribal governmental purposes; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) as a result of the annual budgets referred to in subparagraph (C), no net revenues from parcel B were available for distribution to tribal members entitled to equalization under section 3 of the Act referred to in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) by letter of December 6, 1961, the Director of the Sacramento Area Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs informed the regional solicitor of the Bureau of Indian Affairs that the equalization of allotments on the Agua Caliente Reservation with respect to those members of the Band who were eligible for <!-- PDFPage:357 -->equalization had been completed using all available excess tribal land in a manner consistent with&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) on March 16, 1983, the Secretary of the Interior published notice in the Federal Register that full equalization had been achieved within the meaning of section 7 of the Act (25 U.S.C. 957);</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall determine on the basis of the contract appraisals that were made in 1957 and 1958 (1) the value of all unallotted tribal land, and (2) the value of the allotment of each allottee who is living on September 21, 1959, excluding the value of any improvements thereon. Where lands of a living allottee have been sold under the supervision of the Secretary, their value for the purpose of equalization shall be the amount received from such sale, excluding the value assigned to any improvements thereon. Where lands of a living allottee have been fee patented to and sold by the allottee, their value for the purpose of equalization shall be the appraised value of the lands, excluding improvements, as of the time of the sale, regardless of the amount received from the sale. The allotments of allottees who are not living on September 21, 1959 shall be excluded from the equalization program. All values so determined by the Secretary shall be final and conclusive for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">On the basis of such values, the Secretary shall determine the highest level of equalization that is feasible for the members of the band who are living at the time of this Act by allotting all of the unallotted tribal land, except the reserved areas listed in subsection (b) of this section, without regard to acreage limitations heretofore imposed by law. Such unallotted tribal land shall then be allotted to those members who have received allotments with a value that is less than the equalization figure deemed feasible in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Secretary. No selection of an allotment pursuant to such procedures shall create a vested right in the land until all selections authorized by this subchapter have been made, included in one schedule, and approved by the Secretary.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Portions in airport subject to allotment unless sold; procedure for sale; payment of sale proceeds in lieu of allotment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No guardian, conservator or other fiduciary appointed under State law shall, in his official capacity, participate in the management or disposition of any property or interest therein which is held in trust by the United States for a member of the band or is subject to restrictions against alienation imposed by the laws of the United States, execute or approve any use, expenditure, investment, deposit, or disposition of such property or interest therein, or proceeds therefrom, or receive any fee or other compensation for services hereafter performed with respect to such property or interest therein. The provisions of this subsection shall not preclude any such person, in his private capacity, from <!-- PDFPage:359 -->participating in the management or disposition of such property or interest therein with the specific approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

If any person or entity required to do so by the Secretary fails or refuses to so report, or, if having reported, the Secretary concludes that any action connected therewith is fraudulent, or capricious or arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, he may request the Attorney General to cause an action to be brought in the name of the United States in the United States District Court for the Central District of California or in any such district court having jurisdiction over the person, or persons, and subject matter, for such relief as may be appropriate, and said courts are hereby granted jurisdiction to hear and determine such action.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assignment, sale, hypothecation, attachment or levy void unless approved</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Equalization allotments made pursuant to this subchapter shall not be subject to assignment, sale, or hypothecation or to any attachment or levy for claims or debts created before or after September 21, 1959, without the written approval of the Secretary, and any such assignment, sale, hypothecation, attachment, or levy that has not been so approved by the Secretary shall be absolutely null and void.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liens and lis pendens; legal services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No equalization allotment made pursuant to this subchapter, and no basic allotment made prior to this Act, shall be subject to an equitable charging lien or other charge or lien or enforced sale for any advantage or benefit which the allottee has received or will receive under or as a consequence of enactment of this subchapter, nor shall any lis pendens heretofore or hereafter filed upon such lands while in a restricted status be of any effect or constitute notice of any action. Whoever directly or indirectly accepts or receives any money or other form of compensation for legal services in connection with such restricted lands from any person who has not expressly employed him as his attorney shall be liable, in a civil action brought by the payor or his heirs or devisees or by the United States on his behalf, for twice the amount so accepted or received unless, prior to the time of acceptance or receipt of said compensation, the right to such compensation has been determined and the amount thereof fixed by a formal order of the Federal court having jurisdiction to make such order. Nothing herein provided shall be construed to prevent any attorney from petitioning the Federal court having jurisdiction to fix and determine the fees to which he is entitled and to pursue and enforce payment thereof in any lawful manner after the court has made such order.</p>
