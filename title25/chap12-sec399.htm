<p class="statutory-body"><em>Location of mining claims</em>&mdash;Unallotted lands, or such portion thereof as the Secretary of the Interior shall determine, within Indian reservations withheld prior to June 30, 1919, from disposition under the mining laws may be declared by the Secretary of the Interior to be subject to exploration for the discovery of deposits of gold, silver, copper, and other valuable metalliferous minerals and nonmetalliferous minerals, not including oil and gas, by citizens of the United States, and after such declaration mining claims may be located by such citizens in the same manner as mining claims are located under the mining laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><em>Preference right of locators of claims to lease of lands</em>&mdash;The locators of all such mining claims, or their heirs, successors, or assigns, shall have a preference right to apply to the Secretary of the Interior for a lease, under the terms and conditions of this section, within one year after the date of the location of any mining claim, and any such locator who shall fail to apply for a lease within one year from the date of location shall forfeit all rights to such mining claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><em>Filing copies of location notices</em>&mdash;Duplicate copies of the location notice shall be filed within sixty days with the superintendent in charge of the reservation on which the mining claim is located, and application for a lease under this section may be filed with such superintendent for transmission, through official channels, to the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><em>Lands excepted from entry as mining claims</em>&mdash;Lands containing springs, water holes, or other bodies of water needed or used by the Indians for watering livestock, irrigation, or water-power purposes shall not be designated by the Secretary of the Interior as subject to entry under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><em>Reservation of surface of leased land to United States; easements</em>&mdash;The Secretary of the Interior, in his discretion, in making any lease under this section, may reserve to the United States the right to lease for a term not exceeding that of the mineral lease, the surface of the lands embraced within such lease under existing law or laws hereafter enacted, insofar as said surface is not necessary for use of the lessee in extracting and removing the deposits therein: <em>Provided</em>, That the said Secretary, during the life of the lease, is hereby authorized to issue such permits for easements herein provided to be reserved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><em>Rights and duties of successors to lessees</em>&mdash;Any successor in interest or assignee of any lease granted under this section, whether by voluntary transfer, judicial sale, foreclosure sale, or otherwise, shall be subject to all the conditions of the lease under which such rights are held and also subject to all the provisions and conditions of this section to the same extent as though such successor or assign were the original lessee hereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><em>Forfeiture of leases; notice</em>&mdash;Any lease granted under this section may be forfeited and canceled by appropriate proceedings in the United States district court for the district in which said property or some part thereof is situated whenever the lessee, after reasonable notice in writing, as prescribed in the lease, shall fail to comply with the terms of this section or with such conditions not inconsistent herewith as may be specifically recited in the lease.</p>
