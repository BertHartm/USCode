<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;462, title I, &sect;101, Nov. 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 1991, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual members of Indian tribes;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:660 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as a result of the allotment Acts and related Federal policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from tribal ownership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, often without their owner's consent;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) without restrictions on alienation, allotment owners were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit to their owners;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been extended indefinitely;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the trust allotments that have remained in trust status has become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of undivided interests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total interests;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue to be made;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the fractional interests described in this section often provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those interests and the administrative costs borne by the United States for those interests are inordinately high;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S[.] Ct. 727 (1997)), the United States Supreme Court found the application of section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the facts presented in that case to be unconstitutional, forcing the Department of the Interior to address the status of thousands of undivided interests in trust and restricted lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered to escheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) the Secretarial Order also directed appropriate officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such interests &lsquo;to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow exponentially;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands described in this section is the result of a policy of the Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and requires a solution under Federal law.[;]</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or restricted Indian lands is a matter of Federal law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-determination, the Federal Government should encourage the recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over a reservation to establish a tribal probate code for that reservation.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;462, title I, &sect;102, Nov. 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 1992, provided that: &ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust allotments made to Indians;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of those interests into usable parcels;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that enhances tribal sovereignty;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any tribe, acting through its governing body, is authorized, with the approval of the Secretary to adopt a land consolidation plan providing for the sale or exchange of any tribal lands or interest in lands for the purpose of eliminating undivided fractional interests in Indian trust or restricted lands or consolidating its tribal landholdings: <em>Provided</em>, That&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the tribal land involved in an exchange is of greater or lesser value than the land for which it is being exchanged, the tribe may accept or give cash in such exchange in order to equalize the values of the property exchanged;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any proceeds from the sale of land or interests in land or proceeds received by the tribe to equalize an exchange made pursuant to this section shall be used exclusively for the purchase of other land or interests in land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Secretary shall maintain a separate trust account for each tribe selling or exchanging land pursuant to this section consisting of the proceeds of the land sales and exchanges and shall release such funds only for the purpose of buying lands under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) any tribe may retain the mineral rights to such sold or exchanged lands and the Secretary shall assist such tribe in determining the value of such mineral rights and shall take such value into consideration in determining the fair market value of such lands.</p>
