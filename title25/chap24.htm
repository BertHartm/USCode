<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as a result of the allotment Acts and related Federal policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from tribal ownership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, often without their owner's consent;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) without restrictions on alienation, allotment owners were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit to their owners;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been extended indefinitely;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the trust allotments that have remained in trust status has become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of undivided interests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total interests;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue to be made;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the fractional interests described in this section often provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those interests and the administrative costs borne by the United States for those interests are inordinately high;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S[.] Ct. 727 (1997)), the United States Supreme Court found the application of section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the facts presented in that case to be unconstitutional, forcing the Department of the Interior to address the status of thousands of undivided interests in trust and restricted lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered to escheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) the Secretarial Order also directed appropriate officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such interests &lsquo;to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow exponentially;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands described in this section is the result of a policy of the Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and requires a solution under Federal law.[;]</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or restricted Indian lands is a matter of Federal law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-determination, the Federal Government should encourage the recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over a reservation to establish a tribal probate code for that reservation.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust allotments made to Indians;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of those interests into usable parcels;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any tribe, acting through its governing body, is authorized, with the approval of the Secretary to adopt a land consolidation plan providing for the sale or exchange of any tribal lands or interest in lands for the purpose of eliminating undivided fractional interests in Indian trust or restricted lands or consolidating its tribal landholdings: <em>Provided</em>, That&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the tribal land involved in an exchange is of greater or lesser value than the land for which it is being exchanged, the tribe may accept or give cash in such exchange in order to equalize the values of the property exchanged;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any proceeds from the sale of land or interests in land or proceeds received by the tribe to equalize an exchange made pursuant to this section shall be used exclusively for the purchase of other land or interests in land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Secretary shall maintain a separate trust account for each tribe selling or exchanging land pursuant to this section consisting of the proceeds of the land sales and exchanges and shall release such funds only for the purpose of buying lands under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) any tribe may retain the mineral rights to such sold or exchanged lands and the Secretary shall assist such tribe in determining the value of such mineral rights and shall take such value into consideration in determining the fair market value of such lands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conveyancing requirement; specific findings for nonexecution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary must execute such instrument of conveyance needed to effectuate a sale or exchange of tribal lands made pursuant to an approved tribal land consolidation plan unless he makes a specific finding that such sale or exchange is not in the best interest of the tribe or is not in compliance with the tribal land consolidation plan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any provision of Federal law requiring the Secretary to approve individual Indian leases of individual Indian trust or restricted land, where the owners of all of the undivided trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land have submitted applications to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and the Secretary has approved such applications under subsection (d) of this section, such owners may, without further approval by the Secretary, enter into a lease of the parcel for agricultural purposes for a term not to exceed 10 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No such lease shall be effective until it has been executed by the owners of all undivided trust or restricted interests in the parcel.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commencement of owner-managed status</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Validity of leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No lease of trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land that is owner-managed under this <!-- PDFPage:712 -->section shall be valid or enforceable against the owners of such interests, or against the land, the interest or the United States, unless such lease&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is consistent with, and entered into in accordance with, the requirements of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has been approved by the Secretary in accordance with other Federal laws applicable to the leasing of trust or restricted land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Lease revenues</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Jurisdiction unaffected by status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Indian tribe with jurisdiction over an interest in trust or restricted land that becomes owner-managed pursuant to this section shall continue to have jurisdiction over the interest to the same extent and in all respects that such tribe had prior to the interest acquiring owner-managed status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Persons using land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person holding, leasing, or otherwise using such interest in land shall be considered to consent to the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe referred to in paragraph (1), including such tribe's laws and regulations, if any, relating to the use, and any effects associated with the use, of the interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Continuation of owner-managed status; revocation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), after the applications of the owners of all of the trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land have been approved by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, each such interest shall continue in owner-managed status under this section notwithstanding any subsequent conveyance of the interest in trust or restricted status to another person or the subsequent descent of the interest in trust or restricted status by testate or intestate succession to 1 or more heirs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Owner-managed status of an interest may be revoked upon written request of the owners (including the parents or legal guardians of minors or incompetent owners) of all trust or restricted interests in the parcel, submitted to the Secretary in accordance with regulations adopted under subsection (<em>l</em>).<sup><a href="#2220_1_target" name="2220_1">1</a></sup> The revocation shall become effective as of the date on which the last of all such requests has been delivered to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of revocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Revocation of owner-managed status under paragraph (2) shall not affect the validity of any lease made in accordance with the provisions of this section prior to the effective date of the revocation, provided that, after such revocation becomes effective, the Secretary shall be responsible for the collection of, and accounting for, all future lease revenues accruing to the trust or restricted interests in the parcel from and after such effective date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) no revocation has occurred under subsection (h)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Secretarial approval of other transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except with respect to the specific lease transaction described in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this section, interests that acquire owner-managed status under the provisions of this section shall continue to be subject to all Federal laws requiring the Secretary to approve transactions involving trust or restricted land (including leases with terms of a duration in excess of 10 years) that would otherwise apply to such interests if the interests had not acquired owner-managed status under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Effect of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsections (c), (f), and (h) of this section, nothing in this section diminishes or otherwise affects any authority or responsibility of the Secretary with respect to an interest in trust or restricted land.</p>
