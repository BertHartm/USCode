<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) &ldquo;associated funerary objects&rdquo; which shall mean objects that, as a part of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, are reasonably believed to have been placed with individual human remains either at the time of death or later, and both the human remains and associated funerary objects are presently in the possession or control of a Federal agency or museum, except that other items exclusively made for burial purposes or to contain human remains shall be considered as associated funerary objects.<sup><a href="#3001_1_target" name="3001_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) &ldquo;unassociated funerary objects&rdquo; which shall mean objects that, as a part of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, are reasonably believed to have been placed with individual human remains either at the time of death or later, where the remains are not in the possession or control of the Federal agency or museum and the objects can be identified by a preponderance of the evidence as related to specific individuals or families or to known human remains or, by a preponderance of the evidence, as having been removed from a specific burial site of an individual culturally affiliated with a particular Indian tribe,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) &ldquo;sacred objects&rdquo; which shall mean specific ceremonial objects which are needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present day adherents, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) &ldquo;cultural patrimony&rdquo; which shall mean an object having ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual Native American, and which, therefore, cannot be alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by any individual regardless of whether or not the individual is a member of the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and such object shall have been considered inalienable by such Native American group at the time the object was separated from such group.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &ldquo;Federal agency&rdquo; means any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States. Such term does not include the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

Such term does not include the Smithsonian Institution or any other Federal agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) &ldquo;Native American&rdquo; means of, or relating to, a tribe, people, or culture that is indigenous to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) &ldquo;Native Hawaiian&rdquo; means any individual who is a descendant of the aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now constitutes the State of Hawaii.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) &ldquo;Native Hawaiian organization&rdquo; means any organization which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) &ldquo;right of possession&rdquo; means possession obtained with the voluntary consent of an individual or group that had authority of alienation. The original acquisition of a Native American unassociated funerary object, sacred object or object of cultural patrimony from an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization with the voluntary consent of an individual or group with authority to alienate such object is deemed to give right of possession of that object, unless the phrase so defined would, as applied in section 3005(c) of this title, result in a Fifth Amendment taking by the United States as determined by the United States Court of Federal Claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1491 in which event the &ldquo;right of possession&rdquo; shall be <!-- PDFPage:711 -->as provided under otherwise applicable property law. The original acquisition of Native American human remains and associated funerary objects which were excavated, exhumed, or otherwise obtained with full knowledge and consent of the next of kin or the official governing body of the appropriate culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization is deemed to give right of possession to those remains.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; means the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) &ldquo;tribal land&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

If the discovery occurred in connection with an activity, including (but not limited to) construction, mining, logging, and agriculture, the person shall cease the activity in the area of the discovery, make a reasonable effort to protect the items discovered before resuming such activity, and provide notice under this subsection. Following the notification under this subsection, and upon certification by the Secretary of the department or the head of any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that notification has been received, the activity may resume after 30 days of such certification.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Repatriation of Native American human remains and objects possessed or controlled by Federal agencies and museums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, pursuant to section 3003 of this title, the cultural affiliation of Native American human remains and associated funerary objects with a particular Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization is established, then the Federal agency or museum, upon the request of a known lineal descendant of the Native American or of the tribe or organization and pursuant to subsections (b) and (e) of this section, shall expeditiously return such remains and associated funerary objects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, pursuant to section 3004 of this title, the cultural affiliation with a particular Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization is shown with respect to unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony, then the Federal agency or museum, upon the request of the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and pursuant to subsections (b), (c) and (e) of this section, shall expeditiously return such objects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The return of cultural items covered by this chapter shall be in consultation with the requesting lineal descendant or tribe or organization to determine the place and manner of delivery of such items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Where cultural affiliation of Native American human remains and funerary objects has not been established in an inventory prepared pursuant to section 3003 of this title, or the summary pursuant to section 3004 of this title, or where Native American human remains and funerary objects are not included upon any such inventory, then, upon request and pursuant to subsections (b) and (e) of this section and, in the case of unassociated funerary objects, subsection (c) of this section, such Native American human remains and funerary objects shall be expeditiously returned where the requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization can show cultural affiliation by a preponderance of the evidence based upon geographical, kinship, biological, archaeological, anthropological, linguistic, folkloric, oral traditional, historical, or other relevant information or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Upon request and pursuant to subsections (b), (c) and (e) of this section, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony shall be expeditiously returned where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the requesting party is the direct lineal descendant of an individual who owned the sacred object;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization can show that the object was owned or controlled by the tribe or organization; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization can show that the sacred object was owned or controlled by a member thereof, provided that in the case where a sacred object was owned by a member thereof, there are no identifiable lineal descendants of said member or the lineal descendants, upon notice, have failed to make a claim for the object under this chapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:714 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Scientific study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization requests the return of culturally affiliated Native American cultural items, the Federal agency or museum shall expeditiously return such items unless such items are indispensable for completion of a specific scientific study, the outcome of which would be of major benefit to the United States. Such items shall be returned by no later than 90 days after the date on which the scientific study is completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standard of repatriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a known lineal descendant or an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization requests the return of Native American unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony pursuant to this chapter and presents evidence which, if standing alone before the introduction of evidence to the contrary, would support a finding that the Federal agency or museum did not have the right of possession, then such agency or museum shall return such objects unless it can overcome such inference and prove that it has a right of possession to the objects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Sharing of information by Federal agencies and museums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal agency or museum shall share what information it does possess regarding the object in question with the known lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization to assist in making a claim under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Competing claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where there are multiple requests for repatriation of any cultural item and, after complying with the requirements of this chapter, the Federal agency or museum cannot clearly determine which requesting party is the most appropriate claimant, the agency or museum may retain such item until the requesting parties agree upon its disposition or the dispute is otherwise resolved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Museum obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any museum which repatriates any item in good faith pursuant to this chapter shall not be liable for claims by an aggrieved party or for claims of breach of fiduciary duty, public trust, or violations of state&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3005_1_target" name="3005_1">1</a></sup> law that are inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
