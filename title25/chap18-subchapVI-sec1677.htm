<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the efforts that have been made by Federal and State agencies and mining and milling companies to effectively carry out an education program for such Indians regarding the health and safety hazards of such nuclear resource development.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) preventive care for Indians who may be exposed to such health hazards, including the monitoring of the health of individuals who have or may have been exposed to excessive amounts of radiation, or affected by other nuclear development activities that have had or could have a serious impact upon the health of such individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a program of education for Indians who, by reason of their work or geographic proximity to such nuclear development activities, may experience health problems.</p>
