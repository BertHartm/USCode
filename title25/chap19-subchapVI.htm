<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is pending before the United States District Court for the southern district of Florida a lawsuit by the Seminole Tribe which involves certain lands within the State and there are also claims by the tribe to other areas of Florida by virtue of an 1839 Executive order of the President and by right of non-extinguishment of aboriginal possession which has been asserted but not filed in court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the pendency of this lawsuit and these claims may result in economic hardships for residents of the State by clouding the titles to lands in the State, including lands not now involved in the lawsuit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the pendency of this lawsuit and these claims also have clouded the easement rights of the South Florida Water Management District in lands necessary for use as a water flowage and storage area, which is part of a federally authorized project for flood control and water management in central and southern Florida, and which is being used to provide and regulate a water supply for the residents of south Florida;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the State, the district, and the tribe have executed agreements for the purposes of resolving tribal land claims and settling the lawsuit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which include conveyance of land and payment of consideration to the tribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which require implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States and the Legislature of the State of Florida;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Congress shares with the parties to such agreements a desire to settle these Indian <!-- PDFPage:549 -->claims in the State of Florida without additional cost to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the water rights of the tribe, and that continued controversy over this should be settled by agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the State, the district, and the tribe have entered into a compact which, if approved by Congress and the Florida Legislature, creates specifically defined water rights in lieu of the undefined water rights claimed by the tribe.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Acceptance of land by Secretary in trust for Seminole Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any clouds on title, the Secretary is authorized and directed, as soon as practicable after December 31, 1987, to accept the transfer to the United States, to be held in trust and as a reservation for the use and benefit of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the approximate 15 sections of land being described as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning at the southwest corner of section 31, township 48 south, Range 35 east; thence easterly along the south border of sections 31, 32 and 33, township 48 south, Range 35 east, to the westernmost boundary of the levee 28 works in section 33, township 48 south, Range 35 east; thence continuing north along the westernmost boundary of the levee 28 works to the point at which the westernmost boundary of the levee 28 works intersects the southernmost boundary of the levee 4 works in section 9, township 48 south, Range 35 east; thence continuing westerly along the southernmost boundary of the levee 4 works to the point at which the southernmost boundary of the levee 4 works intersects the dividing line between township 48 south, Range 35 east and township 48 south, Range 34 east at the Broward County and Hendry County line; and thence continuing south along said line to the point of beginning; said lands situate, lying and being in Broward County, Florida.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Survey of Seminole Federal Reservations in Florida</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on December 31, 1987, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) conduct a cadastral survey of those portions of the Seminole Federal Reservations in Florida not previously surveyed by the Department of the Interior, including all lands taken into trust as reservations under the authority of this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publish the correct legal descriptions of the Seminole Reservations in the Federal Register within 180 days after the survey is completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acceptance of land in future by Secretary in trust for Seminole Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Settlement Agreement, there is a subsequent agreement between the tribe, the State, and the district providing that lands exchanged with the tribe or acquired by the tribe may be taken into Federal <!-- PDFPage:551 -->trust as a reservation for the tribe, the Secretary shall accept the transfer of such lands to the United States, to be held in trust for the use and benefit of the tribe pursuant to the terms and conditions of the subsequent agreement unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total amount of land previously taken in trust under this subsection exceeds the amount of land transferred to the State and Water District by the tribe under the Settlement Agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines in writing that either the size, location, or condition of the land, or the terms and conditions under which it is transferred would place an unreasonable burden on the United States as trustee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the land is not in Florida; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the land is not agricultural in nature.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil and criminal jurisdiction over lands acquired by United States in trust for Seminole Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the acquisition of any land under subsection (a) or (c) of this section by the United States in trust for the tribe, the assumption of jurisdiction in favor of the State contained in section 285.16, Florida Statutes, pursuant to section 7 of the Act of August 15, 1953,<sup><a href="#1772d_1_target" name="1772d_1">1</a></sup> (67 Stat. 588; Public Law 280), shall continue in full force and effect on such lands unless the United States accepts a retrocession by the State of such civil or criminal jurisdiction in whole or in part under section 1323 of this title. The laws of Florida relating to alcoholic beverages, gambling, sale of cigarettes, and their successor laws, shall have the same force and effect within said transferred lands as they have elsewhere within the State. The State, with respect to the transferred lands, shall also have jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians under said laws to the same extent the State has jurisdiction over said offenses committed elsewhere within the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as permitting the exercise of the above jurisdiction by the State regarding matters to which section 1162(b) of title 18 and section 1360(b) of title 28 apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The scope of tribal sovereignty over transferred lands, with the specific exceptions of law relating to cigarettes, gambling and alcohol described in this subsection, shall be as required by applicable law with regard to existing tribal lands held in reservation or Federal trust status. Such transfer shall not confer upon the tribe, or upon the lands within the reservation, any additional water rights. Tribal water rights shall be deemed to be defined in the compact.</p>
