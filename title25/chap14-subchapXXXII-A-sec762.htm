For the purpose of providing for Federal services and benefits, the service area shall be Iron, Millard, Sevier, and Washington Counties, Utah, except that should lands in any other county be added to the reservation pursuant to section 766(c) of this title, the service area shall also include the area on or near the additions to the reservation.</p>
