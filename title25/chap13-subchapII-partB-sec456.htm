<p class="note-body">Section 7814(c)(4) of title 20, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original &ldquo;section 9104(c)(4) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965&rdquo;, meaning section 9104(c)(4) of Pub. L. 89&ndash;10, which was translated as reading section 9114(c)(4) of Pub. L. 89&ndash;10 to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 89&ndash;10 does not contain a section 9104, but it does contain a section 9114 which in subsec. (c)(4) relates to committees of parents of Indian children.</p>
