<h4 class="note-head">References in Text</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Buy American Act of 1933, and the Buy American Act, referred to in subsecs. (a) to (d), is title III of act Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 212, 47 Stat. 1520, as amended, known as the Buy American Act, which enacted sections 10a, 10b, 10b&ndash;1, and 10c of Title 41, Public Contracts, and enacted provisions set out as notes under section 10c of Title 41. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 10a of Title 41 and Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Trade Agreement Act of 1979, referred to in subsec. (c), probably means the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Pub. L. 96&ndash;39, July 26, 1979, 93 Stat. 144, as amended. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see References in Text note set out under section 2501 of Title 19, Customs Duties, and Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subchapter, referred to in subsec. (e), was in the original &ldquo;this title&rdquo; and was translated as reading &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;, meaning Pub. L. 98&ndash;621, which is classified principally to this subchapter, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 98&ndash;621 does not contain titles.</p>
