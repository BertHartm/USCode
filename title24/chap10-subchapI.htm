<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If a resident dies intestate and the heirs or legal representative of the deceased cannot be immediately ascertained, the Director shall retain all property left by the decedent for a three-year period beginning on the date of the death. If entitlement to such property is established to the satisfaction of the Director at any time during the three-year period, the Director shall distribute the decedent's property, in equal pro-rata shares when multiple beneficiaries have been identified, to the highest following categories of identified survivors (listed in the order of precedence indicated):</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon the sale of any such unclaimed estate property, the proceeds of the sale shall be deposited in the Retirement Home Trust Fund.</p>

The heirs or legatees of the deceased resident may file a claim made with the Comptroller General of the United States to reclaim such proceeds. A determination of the claim by the Comptroller General shall be subject to judicial review exclusively by the United States Court of Federal Claims.</p>
