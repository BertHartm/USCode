<p class="statutory-body">The Director of a facility of the Retirement Home shall safeguard and dispose of the estate and personal effects of deceased residents, including effects delivered to such facility under sections 4712(f) and 9712(f) of title 10, and shall ensure the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A will or other instrument of a testamentary nature involving property rights executed by a resident shall be promptly delivered, upon the death of the resident, to the proper court of record.</p>

If entitlement to such property is established to the satisfaction of the Director at any time during the three-year period, the Director shall distribute the decedent's property, in equal pro-rata shares when multiple beneficiaries have been identified, to the highest following categories of identified survivors (listed in the order of precedence indicated):</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon the sale of any such unclaimed estate property, the proceeds of the sale shall be deposited in the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a personal representative or other fiduciary is appointed to administer a deceased resident's estate and the administration is completed before the end of such three-year period, the balance of the entire net proceeds of the estate, less expenses, shall be deposited directly in the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund. The heirs or legatees of the deceased resident may file a claim made with the Secretary of Defense to reclaim such proceeds. A determination of the claim by the Secretary shall be subject to judicial review exclusively by the United States Court of Federal Claims.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The designation of an employee or representative of a facility of the Retirement Home as personal representative of the estate of a resident of the Retirement Home or as a legatee under the will or codicil of the resident shall not disqualify an employee or staff member of that facility from serving as a competent witness to a will or codicil of the resident.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) After the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of the death of a resident of a facility, the Director of the facility shall dispose of all property of the deceased resident that is not otherwise disposed of under this subsection, including personal effects such as decorations, medals, and citations to which a right has not been established under subsection (a) of this section.
