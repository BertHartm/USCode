<p class="statutory-body">(2) The fee shall be fixed as a percentage of Federal payments made to a resident, including monthly retired or retainer pay, monthly civil service annuity, monthly compensation or pension paid to the resident by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and Social Security payments. Residents who do not receive such Federal payments shall be required to pay a monthly fee that is equivalent to the average monthly fee paid by residents who receive Federal payments, subject to such adjustments in the fee as the Retirement Home Board may make.

Each year thereafter, the fee for such resident under this subsection shall be increased 2.5 percent until the percentage fixed under subsection (c) of this section has been reached. Such percentage increase may be adjusted so that the conversion to the fee fixed under subsection (c) of this section is accomplished under this subsection within six years after such effective date.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application of fees for new residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person who becomes a resident of the Retirement Home after the effective date specified in section 1541(a) shall be required to pay a monthly fee that is equal to 25 percent of Federal payments made to the resident, subject to such adjustments in the fee as may be made under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
