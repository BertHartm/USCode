<p class="statutory-body">An individual who receives a voluntary separation incentive payment under this section and <!-- PDFPage:79 -->who, within 5 years after the date of the separation on which the payment is based, accepts any compensated employment with the Government or works for any agency of the Government through a personal services contract, shall be required to pay, prior to the individual's first day of employment, the entire amount of the incentive payment. Such payment shall be made to the covered entity from which the individual separated or, if made on or after the transfer date, to the Deputy Secretary or the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security (for transfer to the appropriate component of the Department of Homeland Security, if necessary).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect on employment levels</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Intended effect</h4>
