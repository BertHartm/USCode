<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal cause of action</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall exist a Federal cause of action for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller. The substantive law for decision in any such action shall be derived from the law, including choice of law principles, of the State in which such <!-- PDFPage:116 -->acts of terrorism occurred, unless such law is inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal cause of action shall be brought only for claims for injuries that are proximately caused by sellers that provide qualified anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal government customers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such appropriate district court of the United States shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all actions for any claim for loss of property, personal injury, or death arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In an action brought under this section for damages the following provisions apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Punitive damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No punitive damages intended to punish or deter, exemplary damages, or other damages not intended to compensate a plaintiff for actual losses may be awarded, nor shall any party be liable for interest prior to the judgment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noneconomic damages</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Noneconomic damages may be awarded against a defendant only in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of responsibility of such defendant for the harm to the plaintiff, and no plaintiff may recover noneconomic damages unless the plaintiff suffered physical harm.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;noneconomic damages&rdquo; means damages for losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, hedonic damages, injury to reputation, and any other nonpecuniary losses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Collateral sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any recovery by a plaintiff in an action under this section shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation, if any, that the plaintiff has received or is entitled to receive as a result of such acts of terrorism that result or may result in loss to the Seller.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Government contractor defense</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Should a product liability or other lawsuit be filed for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the government contractor defense applies in such lawsuit. This presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in submitting information to the Secretary during the course of the Secretary's consideration of such technology under this subsection. This presumption of the government contractor defense shall apply regardless of whether the claim against the Seller arises from a sale of the product to Federal Government or non-Federal Government customers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exclusive responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary will be exclusively responsible for the review and approval of anti-terrorism technology for purposes of establishing a government contractor defense in any product liability lawsuit for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (3), have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller. Upon the Seller's submission to the Secretary for approval of anti-terrorism technology, the Secretary will conduct a comprehensive review of the design of such technology and determine whether it will perform as intended, conforms to the Seller's specifications, and is safe for use as intended. The Seller will conduct safety and hazard analyses on such technology and will supply the Secretary with all such information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For anti-terrorism technology reviewed and approved by the Secretary, the Secretary will issue a certificate of conformance to the Seller and place the anti-terrorism technology on an Approved Product List for Homeland Security.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall in any way limit the ability of any person to seek any form of recovery from any person, government, or other entity that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) attempts to commit, knowingly participates in, aids and abets, or commits any act of terrorism, or any criminal act related to or resulting from such act of terrorism; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) participates in a conspiracy to commit any such act of terrorism or any such criminal act.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;466. Sense of Congress reaffirming the continued importance and applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 1385 of title 18 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Posse Comitatus Act&rdquo;) prohibits the use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly intended to prevent United States Marshals, on their own initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in enforcing Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce the law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Existing laws, including chapter 15 of title 10 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Insurrection Act&rdquo;), and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies, including an attack against the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore public order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress reaffirms the continued importance of section 1385 of title 18, and it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this chapter should be construed to alter the applicability of such section to any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This part may be cited as the &ldquo;Homeland Security Information Sharing Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution to provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist attack.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal Government relies on State and local personnel to protect against terrorist attack.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:127 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and protects classified and sensitive but unclassified information to enhance homeland security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Some homeland security information is needed by the State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for terrorist attack.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected status of such information and to protect the sources and methods used to acquire such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, and local levels of government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt classified information so it may be shared with State and local personnel without the need for granting additional security clearances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) State and local personnel have capabilities and opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Federal Government and State and local governments and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Federal, State, and local governments and intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Information systems, including the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid sharing of classified and sensitive but unclassified information among Federal, State, and local entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Increased efforts to share homeland security information should avoid duplicating existing information systems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland security information to the maximum extent practicable, with special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural communities.</p>
