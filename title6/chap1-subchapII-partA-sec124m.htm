<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 111&ndash;258, &sect;2, Oct. 7, 2010, 124 Stat. 2648, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the &lsquo;9/11 Commission&rsquo;) concluded that security requirements nurture over-classification and excessive compartmentation of information among agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that the over-classification of information interferes with accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing, increases the cost of information security, and needlessly limits stakeholder and public access to information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Over-classification of information causes considerable confusion regarding what information may be shared with whom, and negatively affects the dissemination of information within the Federal Government and with State, local, and tribal entities, and with the private sector.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Over-classification of information is antithetical to the creation and operation of the information sharing environment established under section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (6 U.S.C. 485).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Federal departments or agencies authorized to make original classification decisions or that perform derivative classification of information are responsible for developing, implementing, and administering policies, procedures, and programs that promote compliance with applicable laws, executive orders, and other authorities pertaining to the proper use of classification markings and the policies of the National Archives and Records Administration.&rdquo;</p>
