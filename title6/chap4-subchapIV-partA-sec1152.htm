<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 180 days after August 3, 2007, the Secretary shall prescribe procedures and schedules for the awarding of grants under this subchapter, including application and qualification procedures, and a record of decision on applicant eligibility. The procedures shall include the execution of a grant agreement between the grant recipient and the Secretary and shall be consistent, to the extent practicable, with the grant procedures established under section 70107(i) and (j) of title 46.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Issuance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may issue non-binding letters of intent to recipients of a grant under this subchapter, to commit funding from future budget authority of an amount, not more than the Federal Government's share of the project's cost, for a capital improvement project.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The letter of intent under this subsection shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the recipient for the Government's share of the project's costs, as amounts become available, if the recipient, after the Secretary issues that letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under a grant issued under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice to Secretary</h4>
