<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure protection of information systems for critical infrastructure, including emergency preparedness communications and the physical assets that support such systems, in the information age, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. The information technology revolution has changed the way business is transacted, government operates, and national defense is conducted. Those three functions now depend on an interdependent network of critical information infrastructures. It is the policy of the United States to protect against disruption of the operation of information systems for critical infrastructure and thereby help to protect the people, economy, essential human and government services, and national security of the United States, and to ensure that any disruptions that occur are infrequent, of minimal duration, and manageable, and cause the least damage possible. The implementation of this policy shall include a voluntary public-private partnership, involving corporate and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Continuing Authorities</em>. This order does not alter the existing authorities or roles of United States Government departments and agencies. Authorities set forth in 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and other applicable law, provide senior officials with responsibility for the security of Federal Government information systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Executive Branch Information Systems Security. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has the responsibility to develop and oversee the implementation of government-wide policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of in<!-- PDFPage:21 -->formation systems that support the executive branch departments and agencies, except those noted in section 2(b) of this order. The Director of OMB shall advise the President and the appropriate department or agency head when there is a critical deficiency in the security practices within the purview of this section in an executive branch department or agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) National Security Information Systems. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) shall have responsibility to oversee, develop, and ensure implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of information systems that support the operations under their respective control. In consultation with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the affected departments and agencies, the Secretary of Defense and the DCI shall develop policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of national security information systems that support the operations of other executive branch departments and agencies with national security information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) Policies, principles, standards, and guidelines developed under this subsection may require more stringent protection than those developed in accordance with section 2(a) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs shall advise the President and the appropriate department or agency when there is a critical deficiency in the security practices of a department or agency within the purview of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) National Security Systems. The National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee, as established by and consistent with NSD&ndash;42 and chaired by the Department of Defense, shall be designated as the &ldquo;Committee on National Security Systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Additional Responsibilities. The heads of executive branch departments and agencies are responsible and accountable for providing and maintaining adequate levels of security for information systems, including emergency preparedness communications systems, for programs under their control. Heads of such departments and agencies shall ensure the development and, within available appropriations, funding of programs that adequately address these mission systems, especially those critical systems that support the national security and other essential government programs. Additionally, security should enable, and not unnecessarily impede, department and agency business operations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>The National Infrastructure Advisory Council</em>. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), established on October 16, 2001, shall provide the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security with advice on the security of the critical infrastructure sectors and their information systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Membership. The NIAC shall be composed of not more than 30 members appointed by the President, taking appropriate account of the benefits of having members (i) from the private sector, including but not limited to banking and finance, transportation, energy, communications, and emergency services organizations and institutions of higher learning, and State, local, and tribal governments, (ii) with senior leadership responsibilities for the reliability and availability, which include security, of the critical infrastructure and key resource sectors, (iii) with expertise relevant to the functions of the NIAC, and (iv) with experience equivalent to that of a chief executive of an organization. Unless otherwise determined by the President, no full-time officer or employee of the executive branch shall be appointed to serve as a member of the NIAC. The President shall designate from among the members of the NIAC a Chair and a Vice Chair, who shall perform the functions of the Chair if the Chair is absent, disabled, or in the instance of a vacancy in the Chair.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Functions of the NIAC. The NIAC shall meet periodically to:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) enhance the partnership of the public and private sectors in protecting critical infrastructures and their information systems and provide reports on this issue to the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) propose and develop ways to encourage private industry to perform periodic risk assessments;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) monitor the development and operations of private sector coordinating councils and their information sharing mechanisms and provide recommendations to the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security on how these organizations can best foster improved cooperation among the sectors, the Department of Homeland Security, and other Federal Government entities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) report to the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security, who shall ensure appropriate coordination with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs under the terms of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(v) advise sector specific agencies with critical infrastructure responsibilities to include issues pertaining to sector and government coordinating councils and their information sharing mechanisms.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Administration of the NIAC.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) The NIAC may hold hearings, conduct inquiries, and establish subcommittees, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) Upon request of the Chair, and to the extent permitted by law, the heads of the executive departments and agencies shall provide the NIAC with information and advice relating to its functions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) Senior Federal Government officials may participate in the meetings of the NIAC, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) Members shall serve without compensation for their work on the NIAC. However, members may be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in Federal Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701&ndash;5707).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(v) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Department of Homeland Security shall provide the NIAC with administrative services, staff, and other support services, and such funds as may be necessary for the performance of the NIAC's functions.</p>
