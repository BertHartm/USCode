<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal cause of action</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall exist a Federal cause of action for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller. The substantive law for decision in any such action shall be derived from the law, including choice of law principles, of the State in which such acts of terrorism occurred, unless such law is inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal cause of action shall be brought only for claims for injuries that are proximately caused by sellers that provide qualified anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal government customers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such appropriate district court of the United States shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all actions for any claim for loss of property, personal injury, or death arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In an action brought under this section for damages the following provisions apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Punitive damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No punitive damages intended to punish or deter, exemplary damages, or other damages not intended to compensate a plaintiff for actual losses may be awarded, nor shall any party be liable for interest prior to the judgment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noneconomic damages</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Noneconomic damages may be awarded against a defendant only in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of responsibility of such defendant for the harm to the plaintiff, and no plaintiff may recover noneconomic damages unless the plaintiff suffered physical harm.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;noneconomic damages&rdquo; means damages for losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, hedonic damages, injury to reputation, and any other nonpecuniary losses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Collateral sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any recovery by a plaintiff in an action under this section shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation, if any, that the plaintiff has received or is entitled to receive as a result of such acts of terrorism that result or may result in loss to the Seller.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Government contractor defense</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Should a product liability or other lawsuit be filed for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the government contractor defense applies in such lawsuit. This presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in submitting information to the Secretary during the course of the Secretary's consideration of such technology under this subsection. This presumption of the government contractor defense shall apply regardless of whether the claim against the Seller arises from a sale of the product to Federal Government or non-Federal Government customers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exclusive responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary will be exclusively responsible for the review and approval of anti-terrorism technology for purposes of establishing a government contractor defense in any product liability lawsuit for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (3), have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller. Upon the Seller's submission to the Secretary for approval of anti-terrorism tech<!-- PDFPage:123 -->nology, the Secretary will conduct a comprehensive review of the design of such technology and determine whether it will perform as intended, conforms to the Seller's specifications, and is safe for use as intended. The Seller will conduct safety and hazard analyses on such technology and will supply the Secretary with all such information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For anti-terrorism technology reviewed and approved by the Secretary, the Secretary will issue a certificate of conformance to the Seller and place the anti-terrorism technology on an Approved Product List for Homeland Security.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall in any way limit the ability of any person to seek any form of recovery from any person, government, or other entity that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) attempts to commit, knowingly participates in, aids and abets, or commits any act of terrorism, or any criminal act related to or resulting from such act of terrorism; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) participates in a conspiracy to commit any such act of terrorism or any such criminal act.</p>
