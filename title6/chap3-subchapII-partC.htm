<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Systems to scan containers in accordance with paragraph (1) cannot be purchased, deployed, or operated at ports overseas, including, if applicable, because a port does not have the physical characteristics to install such a system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Systems to scan containers in accordance with paragraph (1) cannot be integrated, as necessary, with existing systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Use of systems that are available to scan containers in accordance with paragraph (1) will significantly impact trade capacity and the flow of cargo.</p>
