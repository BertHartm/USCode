<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scanning of high-risk containers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall ensure that 100 percent of the containers that have been identified as high-risk under paragraph (1), or through other means, are scanned or searched before such containers leave a United States seaport facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Full-scale implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy and foreign partners, as appropriate, shall ensure integrated scanning systems are fully deployed to scan, using nonintrusive imaging equipment and radiation detection equipment, all containers entering the United States before such containers arrive in the United States as soon as possible, but not before the Secretary determines that the integrated scanning system&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 6 months after the submission of a report under section 981(d) of this title, and every 6 months thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees describing the status of full-scale deployment under subsection (b) and the cost of deploying the system at each foreign port at which the integrated scanning systems are deployed.</p>
