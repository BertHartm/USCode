<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the bankruptcy of the Penn Central and other railroads in the Northeast and Midwest resulted in a transportation emergency which required the intervention of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the United States Government created the Consolidated Rail Corporation, which provides essential rail service to the Northeast and Midwest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the future of rail service in the Northeast and Midwest is essential and must be protected through rail service obligations, consistent with the transfer of the Corporation to the private sector;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 has achieved its purpose in allowing the Corporation to become financially self-sustaining;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Federal Government has invested over $7,000,000,000 in providing rail service to the Northeast and Midwest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Corporation's viability and sound performance allow it to be sold to the American public for a substantial sum through a public offering;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a public offering of the Corporation's stock will preserve competitive rail service in the region, provide a reasonable return to the Government, and protect employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the Corporation's employees contributed significantly to the turnaround in the Corporation's financial performance and they should share in the Corporation's success through a settlement of their claims for reimbursement for wages below industry standard, and a share in the common equity of the Corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the requirements of section 761(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1301_1_target" name="1301_1">1</a></sup> of this title are met by this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the Secretary of Transportation has discharged the responsibilities of the Department of Transportation under the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 with respect to the sale of the Corporation as a single entity.</p>
