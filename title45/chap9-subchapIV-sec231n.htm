<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maintenance of account; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Railroad Retirement Account established by section 15(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228<em>o</em>(a)] shall continue to be maintained in the Treasury of the United States. There is hereby appropriated to such Account for each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, to provide for the payment of benefits to be made from such Account in accordance with the provisions of section 231f(c)(1) of this title, and to provide for expenses necessary for the Board in the administration of all provisions of this subchapter, an amount equal to amounts covered into the Treasury (minus refunds) during each fiscal year under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.], except those portions of the amounts covered into the Treasury under section 3211(b), 3221(c), and 3221(d) of such Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3211(b), 3221(c), 3221(d)] as are necessary to provide sufficient funds to meet the obligation to pay supplemental annuities at the level provided under section 231b(e) of this title and, with respect to those entitled to supplemental annuities under section 205(a) of title II of this Act, at the level provided under section 205(a). The Board is directed to determine what portion of the taxes collected under sections 3211(b), 3221(c), and 3221(d) of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3211(b), 3221(c), 3221(d)] is to be credited to the Railroad Retirement Account pursuant to the preceding provisions this subsection and what portion of such taxes is to be credited to the Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. The Board shall make such a determination with respect to each calendar quarter commencing with the quarter beginning January 1, 1975, shall make each such determination not later than fifteen days before each calendar quarter, and shall, as soon as practicable after each such determination, advise the Secretary of the Treasury of the determination made. The Secretary of the Treasury shall credit the amounts covered into the Treasury under sections 3211(b), 3221(c), and 3221(d) of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3211(b), 3221(c), 3221(d)] to the Railroad Retirement Account and the Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account in such proportions as is determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations; military service costs and administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the amount appropriated in subsection (a) of this section, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Railroad Retirement Account for each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, such amount as the Board determines to be necessary to meet (A) the additional costs, resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter, of benefits payable under section 231a of this title, but only to the extent that such Account is not reimbursed for such costs under section 231f(c)(2) of this title, (B) the additional administrative expenses resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter, and (C) any loss in interest to such Account resulting from the payment of additional benefits based on military service credited under this subchapter: <em>Provided, however</em>, That, in determining the amount to be appropriated to the Railroad Retirement Account for any fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, there shall not be considered any costs resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter for which appropriations to such Account have already been made pursuant to section 4(<em>l</em>) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228c&ndash;1(<em>l</em>)]. Any determination as to loss in interest to the Railroad Retirement Account pursuant to clause (C) of the first sentence of this subsection shall take into account interest from the date each annuity based, in part, on military service began to accrue or was increased to the date or dates on which the amount appropriated is credited to the Account. <!-- PDFPage:81 -->The cost resulting from the payment of additional benefits under this subchapter based on military service determined pursuant to the preceding provisions of this subsection shall be adjusted by applying thereto the ratio of the total net level cost of all benefits under this subchapter to the portion of such net level cost remaining after the exclusion of administrative expenses and interest charges on the unfunded accrued liability as determined under the last completed actuarial valuation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section. At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Board shall, as promptly as practicable, determine the amount to be appropriated to the Account pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, and shall certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the general fund in the Treasury to the Railroad Retirement Account. When authorized by an appropriation Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the general fund in the Treasury such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and certified by the Board for transfer to such Account. In any determination made pursuant to section 231f(c)(2) of this title, no further charges shall be made against the Trust Funds established by title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] for military service rendered before January 1, 1957, and with respect to which appropriations authorized by clause (2) of the first sentence of section 4(<em>l</em>) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 shall have been credited to the Railroad Retirement Account, but the additional benefit payments incurred by such Trust Funds by reason of such military service shall be taken in account in making any such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maintenance of Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account established by section 15(b) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228<em>o</em>(b)] shall continue to be maintained in the Treasury of the United States. There is hereby appropriated to such account for each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities under section 231a(b) of this title, and to provide for the expenses necessary for the Board in the administration of the payment of such supplemental annuities, an amount equal to such portions of the amounts covered into the Treasury (minus refunds) during each fiscal year under sections 3211(b), 3221(c), and 3221(d) of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3211(b), 3221(c), 3221(d)] as are not appropriated to the Railroad Retirement Account pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. Whenever the Board finds at any time that the balance in the Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account will be insufficient to pay the supplemental annuities which it estimates are due, or will become due, under section 231a(b) of this title, it shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the credit of the Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account such moneys as the Board estimates would be necessary for the payment of such supplemental annuities, and the Secretary shall make such transfer. Whenever the Board finds that the balance in the Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account, without regard to the amounts transferred pursuant to the next preceding sentence, is sufficient to pay such supplemental annuities, it shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account to the credit of the Railroad Retirement Account such moneys as in its judgment are not needed for the payment of such supplemental annuities, plus interest at an annual rate equal to the average rate of interest borne by all special obligations held by the Railroad Retirement Account on the last day of the preceding fiscal year, rounded to the nearest multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, and the Secretary shall make such retransfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Dual Benefits Payments Account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is hereby created an account in the Treasury of the United States to be known as the Dual Benefits Payments Account. There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to such account for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, such sums as are necessary to pay during such fiscal year the amounts of annuities estimated by the Board to be paid under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93&ndash;445. Not more than 30 days prior to each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, the Board may request the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the credit of the Dual Benefits Payments Account any amount not exceeding the amount that the Board estimates will be necessary to pay on the first day of the next succeeding month the annuity amounts under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93&ndash;445, taking into account any reduction in such annuity amounts as determined under section 231f(c)(1) of this title, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall make such transfer, but at no time shall the total amount of money outstanding to the Dual Benefits Payments Account from the Railroad Retirement Account exceed the amount necessary to pay the annuity amounts under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93&ndash;445 for one month. Not more than 10 days after the funds appropriated to the Dual Benefits Payments Account for each such fiscal year are received into such Account, the Board shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to retransfer from the Dual Benefits Payments Account to the credit of the Railroad Retirement Account an amount equal to the amount transferred to the Dual Benefits Payments Account prior to or during such fiscal year under the preceding sentence, together with such additional amount determined by the Board to be equal to the loss of interest to the Railroad Retirement <!-- PDFPage:82 -->Account resulting from such transfer, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall make such retransfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the Board on January 1, 1984, one-third of the special amount described in subdivision (3) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the Board on January 1, 1985, one-third of the special amount described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, plus an amount equal to the interest that one-third would have earned had it been in the Railroad Retirement Account since January 1, 1984; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the Board on January 1, 1986, the final one-third of the special amount described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, plus an amount equal to the interest that one-third would have earned had it been in the Railroad Retirement Account since January 1, 1984.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The special amount referred to in subdivision (2) of this subsection is the amount which, as of January 1, 1984, would place the Railroad Retirement Account in the same position it would have been on that date if no annuity amounts had been paid during the period beginning January 1, 1975 and ending September 30, 1981, under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93&ndash;445, and no sums had been appropriated as authorized in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purposes of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued after August 12, 1983, under section 3102 of title 31 and the purposes for which securities may be so issued are extended to include such purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The amounts transferred to the Board as loans under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be deposited in the Railroad Retirement Account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The amounts transferred as loans under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be repaid to the general fund to the extent sums are appropriated for that purpose, and there are hereby authorized to be appropriated, in addition to any other sums authorized to be appropriated for the purposes of this subchapter and from any sums in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as may be necessary to make such repayments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the request and direction of the Board, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) to invest such portion of the amounts credited to the Railroad Retirement Account, the Dual Benefits Payments Account and the Railroad Retirement Supplemental Account as, in the judgment of the Board, is not immediately required for the payment of annuities, supplemental annuities, and death benefits. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (A) on original issue at the issue price; or (B) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the accounts. Such obligations issued for purchase by the accounts shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the accounts, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing notes of the United States then forming a part of the public debt that are not due or callable until after the expiration of three years from the end of such calendar month, except that where such rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest on such obligation shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such rate: <em>Provided</em>, That the rate of interest on such obligations shall in no case be less than 3 per centum per annum. At the request of the Board the Secretary shall purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United States, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, or other obligations which are lawful investments for trust funds of the United States, on original issue or at the market price: <em>Provided</em>, That the interest yield of such obligations shall not be less than the interest rate determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. At the request of the Board, the Secretary shall sell at the market price such obligations in the accounts (other than special obligations issued exclusively to the accounts) as the Board designates. The Board shall from time to time request the Secretary to redeem such special obligations issued exclusively to the accounts as the Board designates and upon such request the Secretary shall redeem such obligations at par plus accrued interest. All requests of the Board to the Secretary, provided for in this subsection, shall be mandatory upon the Secretary. It shall be the duty of the Board to determine at all times what proportion of the accounts shall be invested in other than special obligations issued to the accounts and further to determine which of such obligations available to the accounts consistent with the foregoing requirements will provide the greatest rate of return on the funds invested.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Actuarial Advisory Committee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board is hereby authorized and directed to select two actuaries, one from recommendations made by representatives of employees and the other from recommendations made by representatives of employers as defined in paragraph (i) of section 231(a)(1) of this title. These actuaries, along with a third who shall be designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be known as the Actuarial Advisory Committee with respect to the Railroad Retirement Account. The actuaries so selected shall hold membership in the American Academy of Actuaries and shall be qualified in the evaluation of pension plans: <em>Provided, however</em>, That these requirements shall not apply to any actuary who <!-- PDFPage:83 -->served as a member of the Committee prior to January 1, 1975. The Committee shall examine the actuarial reports and estimates made by the Board and shall have authority to recommend to the Board such changes in actuarial methods as they may deem necessary. The compensation of the members of the Committee, exclusive of the member designated by the Secretary, shall be fixed by the Board on a per diem basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Annual report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall include in its annual report a statement of the status and the operations of the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Retirement Supplemental Accounts, and the Dual Benefits Payments Account. At intervals not longer than three years the Board shall make an estimate of the liabilities created by this subchapter and shall include such estimate in its annual report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authorization of appropriations; administrative expenses of subchapter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are hereby authorized to be appropriated from time to time such sums as may be necessary to provide for the expenses of the Board in administering the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Crediting of accounts for unnegotiated benefit checks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall implement procedures to permit the identification of each check issued for benefits under this subchapter that has not been presented for payment by the close of the sixth month following the month of its issuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, on a monthly basis, credit each account established in the Treasury for the payment of benefits under this subchapter for the proportionate amount of benefit checks (including interest thereon) drawn on each such Account more than six months previously but not presented for payment and not previously credited to such Account, to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a benefit check is presented for payment to the Treasury and the amount of the appropriate portion thereof has been previously credited pursuant to paragraph (2) to an Account or Accounts, the Secretary of the Treasury shall nevertheless pay such check, if otherwise proper, recharge such Account or Accounts for the amount of such check attributable to such Account or Accounts and notify the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A benefit check bearing a current date may be issued to an individual who did not negotiate the original benefit check and who surrenders such check for cancellation if the Secretary of the Treasury determines it is necessary to effect proper payment of benefits.</p>
