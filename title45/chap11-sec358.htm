The rate computed in accordance with the preceding steps, after any reduction under this clause, is the contribution rate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) New-employer contribution rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C), the contribution rate applicable to a new employer who does not become subject to this chapter until after December 31, 1989, shall be determined as follows:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Benefit ratio</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employer's benefit ratio as of any given June 30 shall be determined by dividing all benefits charged to the employer under paragraph (15) during the 12 calendar quarters ending on such June 30 by the employer's 3-year compensation base as of such June 30 as computed under paragraph (3).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) System compensation base</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The system compensation base as of any given June 30 shall be determined by adding together the amounts of the 1-year compensation bases of all employers and employee representatives subject to this chapter, computed in accordance with paragraph (5), as of such June 30.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(12) Pooled credit ratio</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The pooled credit ratio, if any, for a calendar year shall be determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Step 1</h4>

In determining such balance as of June 30 of any year, so much of the balance to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund as of the close of business on such date as is in excess of $6,000,000 shall be deemed to be part of the balance to the credit of such account. There will be a pooled credit ratio for the calendar year only if that balance is in excess of the greater of $250,000,000 or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $250,000,000 as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph (11).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Step 2</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If there is such an excess amount, divide that excess amount by the system compensation base as of the June 30 preceding the calendar year. The result is the pooled credit ratio for the calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(13) Pooled charge ratio</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The pooled charge ratio, if any, for a calendar year shall be determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Step 1</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to each employer whose contribution rate for that calendar year as computed through step 6 under paragraph (1)(C) was greater than the maximum contribution limit computed under paragraph (20), multiply the employer's 1-year compensation base as of the preceding June 30, as computed in accordance with paragraph (5), by the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the percentage rate determined under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) before the reduction to the maximum contribution limit; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Step 2</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Add the amounts arrived at under step 1 so as to obtain an aggregate amount for all such employers.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Step 3</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each employer whose contribution rate as computed through step 3 under para<!-- PDFPage:122 -->graph (1)(C) was less than 0, the percentage rate by which such employer's rate was raised in order to bring that rate to 0 shall be multiplied by that employer's 1-year compensation base as of the preceding June 30. Subtract the total of the amounts computed under the preceding sentence for all employers from the amount arrived at in step 2.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Step 4</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Divide the aggregate amount arrived at under step 3 by the system compensation base as of the preceding June 30 as computed under paragraph (11) minus the one-year compensation base of those employers whose rates computed through step 6 of paragraph (1)(C) exceeded the maximum contribution rate computed under paragraph (20). The result is the pooled charge ratio for the calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(14) Surcharge rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The surcharge rate for a calendar year, if any, shall be determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Step 1</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Compute the balance to the credit of the account as of the close of business on the preceding June 30, including any amounts in the account attributable to loans made under section 360(d) of this title before October 1, 1985, but disregarding the obligation to repay such loans and interest thereon. In determining such balance as of June 30 of any year, so much of the balance to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund as of the close of business on such date as is in excess of $6,000,000 shall be deemed to be part of the balance to the credit of such account. There will be a surcharge rate for the calendar year only if that balance is less than the greater of $100,000,000 or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $100,000,000 as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph (11).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Step 2</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) With other employers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the event of a merger, consolidation, unification, or reorganization in which an employer combines with another employer and the combination entails no partitioning of the property of the employer, the individual employer records of the 2 employers shall be combined into a joint individual employer record if the parties request such joint treatment pursuant to paragraph (18) or if the Board otherwise determines, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Board, that such joint treatment is desirable.</p>
