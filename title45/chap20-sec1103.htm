<p class="statutory-body">It is the goal of this subtitle to provide Conrail the opportunity to become profitable through the achievement of the following objectives:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonagreement personnel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Employees who are not subject to collective bargaining agreements (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;nonagreement personnel&rdquo;) should forego wage increases and benefits in an amount proportionately equivalent to the amount foregone by agreement employees pursuant to paragraph (4) of this section, adjusted annually to reflect inflation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) After May 1, 1981, the number of nonagreement personnel should be reduced proportionately to any reduction in agreement employees (excluding reductions pursuant to the termination program under section 797a of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suppliers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To facilitate the orderly movement of goods in interstate commerce, materials and services should continue to be available to Conrail, under normal business practices, including the provision of credit and normal financing arrangements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Shippers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Conrail should utilize the revenue opportunities available to it under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and subtitle IV of title 49.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Agreement employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Conrail should enter into collective bargaining agreements with its employees which would reduce Conrail's costs in an amount equal to $200,000,000 a year, beginning April 1, 1981, adjusted annually to reflect inflation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Agreements under this subparagraph may provide for reductions in wage increases and for changes in fringe benefits common to agreement employees, including vacations and holidays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The cost reductions required under this subparagraph in the first year of the agreement may be deferred, but the aggregate cost reductions should be no less than an average of $200,000,000 per year for each of the first three one-year periods beginning April 1, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The amount of cost reductions provided under this paragraph shall be calculated by subtracting the cost of an agreement entered into under this paragraph from (i) the cost that would otherwise result from the application of the national agreement reached by railroad industry and its employees, or (ii) until such national agreement is reached, the cost which the United States Railway Association estimates would result from the application of such a national agreement.</p>
