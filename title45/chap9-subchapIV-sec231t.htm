<p class="note-body">The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, referred to in text, is title I of Pub. L. 93&ndash;445, Oct. 16, 1974, 88 Stat. 1305, and is classified generally to this subchapter (&sect;231 et seq.). Such title I completely amended and revised the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 (approved June 24, 1937, ch. 382, pt. I, 50 Stat. 307), and as thus amended and revised, the 1937 Act was redesignated the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974. Previously, the 1937 Act had completely amended and revised the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935 (approved Aug. 29, 1935, ch. 812, 49 Stat. 967). Section 201 of the 1937 Act provided that the 1935 Act, as in force prior to amendment by the 1937 Act, may be cited as the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935, and that the 1935 Act, as amended by the 1937 Act, may be cited as the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937. The Railroad Retirement Acts of 1935 and 1937 were classified to subchapter II (&sect;215 et seq.) and subchapter III (&sect;228a et seq.), respectively, of this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see this section and Tables.</p>
