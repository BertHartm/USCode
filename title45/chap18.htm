<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the severe operating losses and the deteriorating plant and equipment of the Milwaukee Railroad threaten to cause cessation of its operations in the near future;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a cessation of operations by the Milwaukee Railroad would have serious repercussions on the economies of the States in which such railroad principally operates (the States of Washington, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a cessation of operations of the Milwaukee Railroad would result in the loss of many thousands of jobs of railroad workers and other workers whose employment is dependent upon rail service over the lines presently operated by the Milwaukee Railroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) experienced railroad employees make a valuable contribution toward strengthening the railroad industry; and other railroads have the ability and willingness to employ displaced employees of the Milwaukee Railroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the ownership by employees or by employees and shippers of part or all of the Milwaukee Railroad may be a valuable tool in reorganization and should be given serious consideration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) cessation of essential transportation services by the Milwaukee Railroad would endanger the public welfare;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) cessation of such services is imminent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to meet payroll and other expenses necessary for continuation of services and reorganization of the Milwaukee Railroad.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress declares that emergency measures set forth in this chapter must be taken to restructure the Milwaukee Railroad and to avoid the potential unemployment and damage to the economy of the region and of the Nation which a cessation of essential services by the Milwaukee Railroad would otherwise cause.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b) of this title, or on April 1, 1980, whichever first occurs, the bankruptcy court may authorize the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to section 1170 of title 11. Pending the expiration of the time for appeal of an abandonment order or the determination of any such appeal, the bankruptcy court may authorize the termination of service on a line to be abandoned, and the order authorizing such termination may not be stayed. In authorizing any abandonment pursuant to this section, the court shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that required under section 11347&nbsp;<sup><a href="#904_1_target" name="904_1">1</a></sup> of title 49.</p>

In authorizing any such sale or transfer, the court shall provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interest&nbsp;<sup><a href="#904_2_target" name="904_2">2</a></sup> of employees as that required under section 11347&nbsp;<sup><a href="#904_1_target" name="904_1">1</a></sup> of title 49.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The bankruptcy court may not authorize a sale or transfer pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection unless an appropriate application with respect to such sale or transfer is initiated with the Commission and, within such time as the court may fix, not exceeding 180 days, the Commission, with or without a hearing, as the Commission may determine, and with or without modification or condition, approves such application, or does not act on such application. Any action or order of the Commission approving, modifying, conditioning, or disapproving such application is subject to review by the court only under sections 706(2)(A), 706(2)(B), 706(2)(C), and 706(2)(D) of title 5. An application may be initiated with the Commission prior to the date specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Pending review of an application by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the bankruptcy court may, on a preliminary basis, authorize the sale or transfer of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad to another rail carrier. The court may permit the purchasing carrier to operate interim service as a common carrier over the lines to be purchased, without regard to section 10901 of title 49. In operating <!-- PDFPage:225 -->such service, the purchasing carrier shall use employees of the Milwaukee Railroad to the extent necessary for the operation of such service.

The plan shall include a comprehensive evaluation of the prospects for the financial self-sustainability of the Milwaukee Railroad.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall, within 30 days after the date of submission of a plan under paragraph (1) of this subsection, approve the proposed plan if it finds that such plan is feasible. The finding of the Commission with respect to the feasibility of the plan shall be made pursuant to section 554 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall make a finding that the plan submitted under this section is feasible if it determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) adequate public and private financing is available to the proponents of such plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such plan is fair and equitable to the estate of the Milwaukee Railroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) implementation of such plan will occur by April 1, 1980;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the railroad proposed to be operated under the plan can be operated on a self-sustaining basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the plan contains an assessment of all operating practices, and includes agreements by labor and management to make implementing changes designed to achieve labor productivity increases (which may include changes in work rules to increase productivity) consistent with safe operations and adequate service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the determinations under this paragraph, adequate financing shall include all sources of private funds, the probable value and priority of valid claims against the estate, and Federal, State, or local funds available under programs (in existence as of January 1, 1980) which are or will be available to the proponent and which the proponent is likely to obtain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Submission of findings to bankruptcy court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds that the plan submitted under this section is feasible, it shall submit its finding to the bankruptcy court. Within 10 days after the date of such submission, the bankruptcy court shall, after a hearing, determine whether such plan is fair and equitable to the estate of the Milwaukee Railroad.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Abandonment of lines of railroad under Bankruptcy Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case pending under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act on November 4, 1979, the court may authorize the abandonment of lines of railroad pursuant to section 1170 of title 11. Pending the expiration of the time for appeal of an abandonment order or the determination of any such appeal, the court may authorize the termination of service on a line to be abandoned, and the order authorizing such termination may not be stayed. In authorizing any abandonment pursuant to this section, the court shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that required under section 11347&nbsp;<sup><a href="#915_1_target" name="915_1">1</a></sup> of title 49.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sale or transfer of lines of railroad under Bankruptcy Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case pending under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act on November 4, 1979, the court may authorize the sale or transfer of a line of railroad to be used in continued rail operations, subject to the approval of the Commission under paragraph (2) of this subsection, if the application with respect to such sale or transfer is filed with the Commission on or after November 1, 1979. In authorizing any such sale or transfer, the court shall provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that required under section 11347&nbsp;<sup><a href="#915_1_target" name="915_1">1</a></sup> of title 49.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court described in paragraph (1) may not authorize a sale or transfer pursuant to such paragraph unless an appropriate application with respect to such sale or transfer is initiated with the Commission and, within such time as the court may fix, not exceeding 180 days, the Commission, with or without a hearing, as the Commission may determine, and with or without modification or condition, approves such application, or does not act on such application. Any action or order of the Commission approving, modifying, conditioning, or disapproving such application is subject to review by the court only under sections 706(2)(A), 706(2)(B), 706(2)(C), and 706(2)(D) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If a person has made or makes an offer to acquire from a carrier subject to liquidation a rail line or lines over which no service is provided by that carrier, and that offer has been or is rejected by the trustee in bankruptcy of such carrier, such person may submit an application to the Commission seeking approval of such person's acquisition of such line or lines. A copy of any such application shall be filed simultaneously with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall, within 15 days after the filing of an application under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, determine whether the applicant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is a financially responsible person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) has made a bona fide offer to acquire the line or lines under reasonable terms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) If the Commission's determination under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is affirmative with respect to the matters referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of such subparagraph, the applicant and the trustee in bankruptcy (hereafter in this paragraph referred to collectively as the &ldquo;parties&rdquo;) shall enter into negotiations with respect to terms for the acquisition of the line or lines applied for. If the parties at any time agree on such terms, a request for approval of the acquisition shall be filed with the Commission and the court. If the parties are unable to agree to such terms within 30 days after the date of the Commission's determination under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, either party may, within 60 days after the expiration of such 30-day period, request the Commission to prescribe terms for such acquisition, including compensation for the line or lines to be acquired. The Commission shall prescribe such terms within 60 days after any such request is made. The terms prescribed by the Commission shall be binding upon both parties, subject to court review as provided in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, except that the applicant may withdraw its offer within 10 days after the Commission prescribes such terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If more than one applicant has requested under this subparagraph that the Commission prescribe the terms of acquisition for the same or overlapping lines or portions of such lines, the Commission shall prescribe terms for such acquisition which it determines best serve the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Within 15 days after the Commission prescribes terms under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the Commission shall transmit such terms to the court, unless the offer is withdrawn under such subparagraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall, within 60 days after such transmittal, approve the acquisition under terms prescribed by the Commission if the compensation for the line or lines is not less than that required as a constitutional minimum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Except as provided in this subparagraph, no action shall be taken by the court which would prejudice the acquisition which is the subject of an application under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The Commission shall require that any person acquiring a line or lines under this paragraph use, to the maximum extent practicable, employees or former employees of the carrier subject to liquidation in the operation of service on such line or lines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) No person acquiring a line under this paragraph may transfer or discontinue service on such line prior to the expiration of 4 years after such acquisition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) The Commission shall, within 45 days after January 14, 1983, prescribe such regulations and procedures as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H) As used in this paragraph, the term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) &ldquo;carrier subject to liquidation&rdquo; means a carrier which, on January 14, 1983, was the subject of a proceeding pending under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act or under subchapter IV of chapter 11 of title 11 and which has been ordered by the court to liquidate its properties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) &ldquo;the court&rdquo; means the court having bankruptcy jurisdiction over the carrier subject to liquidation; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:231 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) &ldquo;financially responsible person&rdquo; means a person capable of compensating the carrier subject to liquidation for the acquisition of the line or lines proposed to be acquired and able to cover expenses associated with providing service over such line or lines for a period of not less than 4 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Pending review of an application by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court described in paragraph (1) may, on a preliminary basis, authorize the sale or transfer proposed in such application. The court may permit the purchasing carrier to operate interim service over the lines to be purchased, and in operating such service it shall use employees of the carrier subject to the bankruptcy proceeding to the extent such purchasing carrier deems necessary for the operation of such service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any action or order of the Commission approving, modifying, conditioning, or disapproving an application for the sale or transfer of rail property that is filed with the Commission before November 1, 1979, in connection with a case pending under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act on November 4, 1979&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is subject to review by the court only under sections 706(2)(A), 706(2)(B), 706(2)(C), and 706(2)(D) of title 5; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may not be stayed by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authority of bankruptcy court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority of the bankruptcy court to authorize abandonments, sales, and transfers of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad shall be governed by the provisions of section 904 of this title, rather than the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect on priorities and timing of employee protection payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the priorities or timing of payment of employee protection which might have existed in the absence of this chapter.</p>
