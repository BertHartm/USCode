<p class="statutory-body">(4) In making a determination under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall have the goal of obtaining at least $2,000,000,000 in aggregate gross proceeds for the United States from the public offering and any payments made under section 1311(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of regulation by the Commission and State public utility regulation, the actions authorized by this subsection, the public offering, and the value of the consideration received therefor shall not change the value of the Corporation's assets net of depreciation and shall not be used to alter the calculation of the Corporation's stock or asset values, rate base, expenses, costs, returns, profits, or revenues, or otherwise affect or be the basis for a change in the regulation of any railroad service, rate, or practice provided or established by the Corporation, or any change in the financial reporting practice of the Corporation.</p>
