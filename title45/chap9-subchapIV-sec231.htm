A payment made by an employer to an individual through the employer's payroll shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for service rendered by such individual as an employee of the employer in the period with respect to which the payment is made. Compensation earned in any calendar month before 1947 shall be deemed paid in such month regardless of whether or when payment will have been in fact made, and compensation earned in any calendar year after 1946 but paid after the end of such calendar year shall be deemed to be compensation paid in the calendar year in which it will have been earned if it is so reported by the employer before February 1 of the next succeeding calendar year or if the employee establishes, subject to the provisions of section 231h of this title, the period during which such compensation will have been earned.</p>

If a payment is made by an employer with respect to a personal injury and includes pay for time lost, the total payment shall be deemed to be paid for time lost unless, at the time of payment, a part of such payment is specifically apportioned to factors other than time lost, in which event only such part of the payment as is not so apportioned shall be deemed to be paid for time lost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Solely for purposes of determining amounts to be included in the compensation of an employee, the term &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; shall also include cash tips received by an employee in any calendar month in the course of his employment by an employer unless the amount of such cash tips is less than $20.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for each such calendar month prior to 1968, $160;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding subdivisions of this subsection, the term &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; shall not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) tips, except as is provided under subdivision (3) of this subsection;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) remuneration earned in the service of a local lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer with respect to any calendar month in which the amount of such remuneration is less than $25;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) remuneration for service as a delegate to a national or international convention of a <!-- PDFPage:37 -->railway-labor-organization employer if the individual rendering such service has not previously rendered service, other than as such a delegate, which may be included in his &ldquo;years of service;&rdquo;</p>

The total amount of any subsistence allowance paid under a benefit schedule provided pursuant to section 701 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 shall be considered as having been earned in the month in which the employee first timely filed a claim for such an allowance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) An individual shall be deemed to have &ldquo;a current connection with the railroad industry&rdquo; at the time an annuity begins to accrue to him and at death if, in any thirty consecutive calendar months before the month in which an annuity under this subchapter begins to accrue to him, or the month in which he dies if that first occurs, he will have been in service as an employee in not less than twelve calendar months and, if such thirty calendar months do not immediately precede such month, he will not have been engaged in any regular employment other than employment for an employer or employment with the Department of Transportation, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Surface Transportation Board, the National Mediation Board, the National Transportation Safety Board, the State-owned railroad (as defined in the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982 [45 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.]), so long as it is an instrumentality of the State of Alaska, or the Railroad Retirement Board in the period before such month and after the end of such thirty months. For purposes of section 231a(b) of this title and section 231a(d) of this title only, an individual shall be deemed also to have &ldquo;a current connection with the railroad industry&rdquo; if, after having completed twenty-five years of service, such individual involuntarily and without fault ceased rendering service as an employee under this subchapter and did not thereafter decline an offer of employment in the same class or craft as the individual's most recent employee service.
