<p class="statutory-body">(3) Under no circumstances shall the Secretary of Transportation offer any of the United States shares for sale unless, before the sale date, the Secretary determines, after such consultation, that the estimated sum of the gross proceeds from the sale of all the United States shares will be an adequate amount. A determination by the Secretary under this paragraph shall not be reviewable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In making a determination under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall have the goal of obtaining at least $2,000,000,000 in aggregate gross proceeds for the United States from the public offering and any payments made under section 1311(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subsequent sales</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to comply with the Secretary's requirements under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Cancellation of other securities held by United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In consideration for amounts transferred to the United States under section 1311(b) of this title, the Secretary of Transportation shall, concurrent with the initial public offering described in subsection (a) of this section, deliver to the Corporation all preferred stock, 7.5 percent debentures, and contingent interest notes of the Corporation.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of regulation by the Commission and State public utility regulation, the actions authorized by this subsection, the public offering, and the value of the consideration received therefor shall not change the value of the Corporation's assets net of depreciation and shall not be used to alter the calculation of the Corporation's stock or asset values, rate base, expenses, costs, returns, profits, or revenues, or otherwise affect or be the basis for a change in the regulation of any railroad service, rate, or practice provided or established by the Corporation, or any change in the financial reporting practice of the Corporation.</p>
