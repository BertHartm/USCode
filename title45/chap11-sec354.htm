Such certification shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be accepted subject to the penalty provisions of section 359(a) of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) he does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed in the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute: <em>Provided</em>, That if separate types of work are commonly conducted in separate departments of a single enterprise, each such department shall, for the purposes of this subsection, be deemed to be a separate establishment, enterprise, or other premises.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unsuitable work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No work shall be deemed suitable for the purposes of subsection (a&ndash;2)(ii) of this section, and benefits shall not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise qualified employee for refusing to accept work if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the remuneration, hours, or other conditions of work offered are substantially less favorable to the employee than those prevailing for similar work in the locality, or the rate of remuneration is less than the union wage rate, if any, for similar work in the locality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) as a condition of being employed he would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) acceptance of the work would require him to engage in activities in violation of law or which, by reason of their being in violation of reasonable requirements of the constitution, bylaws, or similar regulations of a bona fide labor organization of which he is a member, would subject him to expulsion from such labor organization; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) acceptance of the work would subject him to loss of substantial seniority rights under any collective bargaining agreement between a railway labor organization, organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], and any other employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Factors in determination of suitable work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining, within the limitations of subsection (c) of this section, whether or not any work is suitable for an employee for the purposes of subsection (a&ndash;2)(ii) of this section, the Board shall consider, in addition to such other factors as it deems relevant, (i) the current practices recognized by management and labor with respect to such work; (ii) the degree of risk involved to such employee's health, safety, and morals; (iii) his physical fitness and prior training; (iv) his experience and prior earnings; (v) his length of unemployment and prospects for securing work in his customary occupation; and (vi) the distance of the available work from his residence and from his most recent work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Voluntarily leaving unsuitable work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of subsection (a&ndash;2)(i) of this section, no voluntary leaving of work shall be deemed to have been without good cause if the Board finds that such work would not have been suitable for the purposes of subsection (a&ndash;2)(ii) of this section.</p>
