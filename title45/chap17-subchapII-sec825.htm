<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any railroad may apply to the Secretary, following October 19, 1976, and in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, for financial assistance for facilities rehabilitation and improvement financing and for such other financial assistance as may be approved by the Secretary. Any regulations promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to this section shall include specific and detailed standards in accordance with which the Secretary shall conduct the evaluations and make the determinations required in subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee or employee-shipper group may apply to the Secretary for financial assistance pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A financially responsible person may apply to the Secretary for financial assistance from funds made available pursuant to section 829(b)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#825_1_target" name="825_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;financially responsible person&rdquo; means a person who (i) is capable of paying the constitutional minimum value of the railroad line proposed to be acquired, and (ii) is able to assure that adequate transportation will be provided over such line for a period of not less than 3 years. Such term includes a governmental authority but does not include a class I or class II rail carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application and determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each application for facilities rehabilitation and improvement financing shall set forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description of the proposed facilities rehabilitation and improvement project for which such railroad is seeking financial assistance, and of the current physical condition of such facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the classification of each main and branch rail line included in such project, as determined in accordance with the final standards and designations under section 823(e) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the track standard under which each such line has been and is being operated and the reasons therefor, and the safety standards and signal requirements necessary under such standard to prevent loss of life and serious accident or injury at grade crossings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the track standard necessary, in the judgment of such railroad, to provide reliable and competitive freight service (and passenger service, where applicable) over each such line, together with such railroad's recommendations as to (i) the most economical method of improving the physical condition of each such line to meet such track standard, (ii) the cost of providing adequate safety standards and signals, and (iii) an economic analysis of the cost of such improvements in condition and in safety standards and signals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) such railroad's estimate as to the cost of labor and materials, and the date of completion, and its opinion as to the priority to be <!-- PDFPage:222 -->accorded such portions of the proposed project as are reasonably divisible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the amount and kind of Federal financial assistance required by such railroad in order to complete the proposed project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) such other information as the Secretary shall by regulation require to assist him in evaluating such application in accordance with this section or for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall act upon each such application within 6 months after the date on which all required information is received, except as otherwise provided in subsection (a)(2) of this section. The Secretary may approve any such application if he determines that providing the requested financial assistance is in the public interest. When making such a determination, the Secretary shall evaluate and consider in the following order of priority (A) the availability of funds from other sources at a cost which is reasonable under principles of prudent railroad financial management in light of the railroad's projected rate of return for the project to be financed and the railroad's rate of return on total capital (represented by the ratio which such carrier's net income, including interest on a long-term debt, bore to the sum of average shareholder's equity, long-term debt, and accumulated deferred income tax for fiscal year 1975) as determined in accordance with the uniform system of accounts promulgated by the Commission, (B) the interest of the public in supplementing such other funds as may be available in order to increase the total amount of funds available for railroad financing, and (C) the public benefits, including any significant railroad restructuring, to be realized from the project to be financed in relation to the public costs of such financing and whether the proposed project will return public benefits sufficient to justify such public costs. Except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, the Secretary, in determining the extent to which a project will provide public benefits, shall give the highest priority to projects which will enhance the ability of the applicant carrier or other carriers to provide essential freight services. With respect to funds appropriated for financial assistance under this section which were authorized pursuant to section 803(a) and (b) of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, applications for such funds for the purpose of coal transportation shall be deemed to be for the provision of essential freight services. The Secretary, in granting financial assistance to any applicant, shall assign the highest priority, among applications for assistance which would return equal public benefits, to applications for assistance for providing safety improvements and signals, including underpasses or overpasses at railroad crossings at which injury or loss of life has frequently occurred or is likely to occur. The Secretary shall assign the highest priorities (i) to those meritorious applications of carriers operating under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act unable to generate such funds in the private sector and (ii) to those meritorious applications for funds to provide for the restructuring of rail freight facilities and systems which handle more than two million rail cars annually, which are located in more than one State, and which are separated by the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may approve applications to provide financial assistance to any employee or employee-shipper ownership group formed pursuant to a plan for the purchase or rehabilitation of a line or lines of railroad or of rail facilities which are considered to be in the public interest. The Secretary shall not use more than 20 percent of the total funds available under this section for such financial assistance. In considering the allocation of available funds and priority of eligible projects under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the availability of viable alternatives to the ownership or rehabilitation by the eligible employee-shipper group for the continuation of rail service. Projects with no such alternative shall receive highest priority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Financing agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the approval of an application for financial assistance under this section, the Secretary shall promptly enter into an agreement with such railroad to provide financing in such amounts and at such times as is sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to meet the reasonable cost, in whole or in part, of the facilities rehabilitation and improvement project which has been approved, in whole or in part. Each such agreement shall include such terms and conditions as are necessary or appropriate, in the judgment of the Secretary, to assure that the financing will be used only in the manner, and for the purposes, approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of a railroad other than a railroad in reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, financing pursuant to this section shall be in the form of purchase by the Secretary of redeemable preference shares at par. Such shares shall be specifically issued for such purpose in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in section 826 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a railroad in reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, the Secretary, in order to provide financing pursuant to this section, may agree to purchase redeemable preference shares of such railroad at par as part of a plan of reorganization of such railroad approved by the court having jurisdiction over the reorganization of such railroad. Such shares shall be specifically issued in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in section 826 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary, in order to provide financing pursuant to this section, may also purchase certificates issued under section 77(c)(3) of the Bankruptcy Act by a trustee of a railroad in reorganization and approved by the reorganization court, under such terms and conditions as may be approved by the Secretary and the reorganization court. In purchasing such trustee certificates or at any time thereafter, the Secretary may agree with the trustee of such railroad in reorganization, subject to the approval of the reorganization court, to exchange such certificates for redeemable preference shares issued, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in section 826 of this title, in connection with a plan of reorganization approved <!-- PDFPage:223 -->by the reorganization court. Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, no certificate shall be purchased under this section unless and until the Secretary makes a finding in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such certificates cannot otherwise be sold at a reasonable rate of interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the project to be financed can reasonably be expected to be maintained as part of a financially self-sustaining railroad system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the probable value of the assets of the railroad in the event of liquidation provides reasonable protection to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may purchase certificates under this section without making the finding referred to in clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) only if such certificates are senior in rights to all outstanding capital stock, common and preferred, of the debtor corporation, and all unsecured debt incurred before the date of commencement of railroad reorganization proceedings pursuant to section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, but subordinate to all senior debt of the debtor corporation whenever such senior debt is incurred. As used in this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;senior debt&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) all costs of administration, incurred or to be incurred by a trustee, and secured debt assumed by a trustee, in connection with the reorganization proceedings and the operation of a debtor's business by a trustee during the pendency of such proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) all secured debt incurred before the date of commencement of railroad reorganization proceedings pursuant to section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act and determined by the court to be a proper claim against the estate and an obligation of the debtor corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a Government authority that applies for financial assistance from funds made available pursuant to section 829(b)(2)<sup><a href="#825_1_target" name="825_1">1</a></sup> of this title for the purchase or rehabilitation of railroad lines purchased under section 10910&nbsp;<sup><a href="#825_1_target" name="825_1">1</a></sup> of title 49, financing pursuant to this section shall be in the form of purchase by the Secretary of bonds or other debt obligations issued for such purpose by such Government authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total par value of the redeemable preference shares and the amount of trustee certificates, bonds, and other debt obligations which the Secretary may purchase from the proceeds received from the issuance and sale of Fund anticipation notes shall not exceed $1,400,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Future purchases of redeemable preference shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total par value of the redeemable preference shares which the Secretary may, after September 30, 1985, make commitments to purchase under this subchapter, shall be determined by the Congress following the receipt by the Congress of the Secretary's recommendations as to the scope and sources of funding of the Fund or any recommended alternative financing mechanism, as submitted pursuant to section 824 of this title, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of the Secretary's investment in redeemable preference shares in any fiscal year (out of proceeds other than those derived through the issuance and sale of Fund anticipation notes) shall not, when added to the amount of his prior investment in such shares, exceed 200 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the Fund bonds which (A) have been issued by the Secretary prior to such fiscal year, and (B) are projected to be issued by the Secretary through the end of such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) neither redemptions of Fund bonds nor their payment at scheduled maturity shall have any bearing on the limitation in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rehabilitation for common carrier service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e) of this section (other than subsection (d)(3) of this section), the Secretary shall immediately purchase redeemable preference shares or trustee certificates convertible to redeemable preference shares under this section as necessary to facilitate the rehabilitation and improvement of Milwaukee Railroad property that has been sold or transferred to another person or retained by the restructured Milwaukee Railroad and that will be used for common carrier rail service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not take any action under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prior to (i) the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b) of this title, or (ii) April 1, 1980, whichever first occurs; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after April 1, 1981.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Funds received from purchases by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection may not be used for the rehabilitation and improvement of any line of railroad which carried less than an average of 3,000,000 gross tons of freight per mile per year during the previous three-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not more than 50 percent of the funds made available at any time for the purchase of redeemable preference shares and trustee certificates under this section may be used for the rehabilitation and improvement of the facilities of any single railroad undergoing restructuring.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Purchase of essential properties for common carrier service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (g) of this section (other than subsections (b)(2) and (d)(3) of this section), the Secretary shall, upon application of a noncarrier entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) purchase, from funds available on May 1, 1980, not less than $38,000,000 in redeemable preference shares, bonds, or trustee certificates convertible to redeemable preference shares under this section as necessary for the purchase, lease, or rehabilitation of properties of the Rock Island Railroad by responsible noncarrier entities to be used for common carrier rail service; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Preference shares, bonds, and trustee certificates purchased under this subsection shall <!-- PDFPage:224 -->be purchased under terms and conditions that insure that the applicant will be financially capable of making the requisite dividend or interest and redemption or principal payments without impairing its financial resources, and the Secretary shall insure that all assistance provided under this subsection is likely to be repaid or can be secured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A)(i) For purposes of this subsection, a responsible noncarrier entity may include an association composed of representatives of national railway labor organizations, employee coalitions, shippers, or any combination thereof, and States or State organizations, which wish to acquire, lease, or rehabilitate properties of the Rock Island Railroad or the Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to a feasible employee, employee-shipper, or State ownership plan. A responsible noncarrier entity may also include any railroad that wishes to contribute any of its properties under common ownership with the property being acquired by the association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Any ownership plan described in clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be submitted to the Secretary no later than August 20, 1980, or such later date as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection, the return on redeemable preference shares shall be the minimum established pursuant to section 826(a)(3) of this title.</p>
