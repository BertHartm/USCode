The finding of the Commission with respect to the feasibility of the plan shall be made pursuant to section 554 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall make a finding that the plan submitted under this section is feasible if it determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the railroad proposed to be operated under the plan can be operated on a self-sustaining basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the plan contains an assessment of all operating practices, and includes agreements by labor and management to make implementing changes designed to achieve labor productivity increases (which may include changes in work rules to increase productivity) consistent with safe operations and adequate service.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Submission of findings to bankruptcy court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds that the plan submitted under this section is feasible, it shall submit its finding to the bankruptcy court. Within 10 days after the date of such submission, the bankruptcy court shall, after a hearing, determine whether such plan is fair and equitable to the estate of the Milwaukee Railroad. The Commission's determination with respect to that issue shall be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds that the plan is feasible and the bankruptcy court determines that the plan is fair and equitable to the estate of the Milwaukee Railroad, the proponents of such plan shall implement the plan no later than April 1, 1980.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) traffic, revenue, marketing, and other data necessary to determine the amount of the acquisition cost of the railroad or portion of the railroad that would be required to continue rail transportation over the railroad line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
