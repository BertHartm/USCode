<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such individual is later determined to have been alive during any of such months, recovery of any benefits paid on the basis of such individual's compensation under section 231a(d) of this title for the months in which such individual was not known to be alive, minus the total of the amounts that would have been paid as a spouse's annuity during such months (treating the application for a widow's or widower's annuity as an application for spouse's annuity), shall be made in accordance with section 231<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
