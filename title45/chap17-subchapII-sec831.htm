<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, guarantee and make commitments to guarantee the payment of the principal balance of, and any interest on, an obligation of an applicant prior to, on, or after the date of execution or the date of disbursement of such obligation, if the proceeds of such obligation shall be or have been used (1) to acquire or to rehabilitate and improve facilities or equipment (which includes but is not limited to computerized car management systems), (2) to develop or establish new railroad facilities, or (3) to acquire, rehabilitate, improve, develop, or establish high-speed rail facilities or equipment. Each guarantee of such an obligation shall be made in accordance with the provisions of sections 831 through 833 of this title and such rules as the Secretary may prescribe to protect reasonably the interest of the United States. Each application for the guarantee of such an obligation or for a commitment to guarantee such an obligation shall be made in writing to the Secretary in such form and with such content as the Secretary prescribes. Such application shall be granted, in whole or in part, if the Secretary determines that the proposed, negotiated, or executed obligation is eligible for such guarantee. Each such guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall be extended in such form, under such terms and conditions, and pursuant to such regulations as the Secretary deems appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter. Such a guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall inure to the benefit of the holder of the obligation to which such guarantee or commitment to guarantee applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligation guarantee fund shall be established and administered by the Secretary as a revolving fund to carry out the provisions of sections 831 through 833 of this title. Moneys in the obligation guarantee fund shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of such fund or invested in bonds or other obligations of the United States approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Full faith and credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All guarantees entered into by the Secretary under this section shall constitute general obligations of the United States of America backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may approve any modification of any provision of a guarantee, or of a commitment to guarantee an obligation, including the rate of interest, time of payment of interest or principal, security, or any other terms and conditions, if the Secretary makes a finding in writing that such modification is equitable and is in the overall best interests of the United States under this subchapter, and that the holder of such obligation consents to such modification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Extent of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate unpaid principal amounts of obligations which may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this section shall not exceed $1,000,000,000 at any one time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rate of interest (exclusive of premium charges for a guarantee and service fees) which shall be paid on the unpaid principal balance of each obligation guaranteed by the Secretary under this section, shall not exceed an annual percentage rate which the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into consideration the prevailing interest rates for similar obligations in the private market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prerequisites for guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No obligation shall be guaranteed and no commitment shall be made to guarantee any obligation under this section, unless and until the Secretary makes a finding in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an obligation for equipment acquisition, rehabilitation, or improvement is secured (A) by the particular equipment which is to be financed or refinanced by such obligation, or (B) in the case of the rehabilitation or improvement of leased equipment, by the lease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) payment of the obligation is required by its terms to be made within 25 years from the date of its execution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financing or refinancing is justified by the present and probable future demand for rail services or high-speed rail services to be rendered by the applicant and will serve to meet demonstrable needs for rail services or high-speed rail services and to provide shippers or passengers with improved service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the applicant has given reasonable assurances that the facilities or equipment to be acquired, rehabilitated, improved, developed, or established with the proceeds of the obligation will be economically and efficiently utilized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the prospective earning power of the applicant, or the value or prospective earning power of any equipment or facilities to be acquired, rehabilitated, improved, developed, or established (or any combination of the foregoing), together with any other security offered by the applicant, is sufficient to provide the United States with reasonable security and protection, except that if the value or prospective earning power of such equipment or facilities is equal to or greater than the amount of the obligation to be guaranteed, the Secretary may not, on the basis of the lack of prospective earning power of the applicant, find that the United States will not be provided with the reasonable security and protection referred to in this paragraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the transaction will result in an improvement in the ability of any affected railroad or high-speed rail carrier to transport passengers or freight; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:228 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in the case of high-speed rail facilities and equipment, at least 85 percent of such facilities and equipment are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, unless the Secretary finds in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such requirement would be inconsistent with the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such facilities and equipment could not be mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a satisfactory quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such a requirement would increase the cost of the facilities and equipment by more than 25 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such a requirement would result in a violation of obligations of the United States under international trade agreements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) General requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The recipients of any guarantees of, or of any commitments to guarantee, an obligation under this section, shall, consistent with their capital resources, maintain their facilities, on a continuing basis, in accordance with standards promulgated under this subsection. The Secretary shall assure compliance with this requirement by regular periodic inspection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Conditions of guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, before making, approving, or extending any guarantee or commitment to guarantee any obligation under this section, require the obligor to agree to such terms and conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to assure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on such obligation, such obligor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will not make any discretionary dividend payments, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) will not use any funds or assets from railroad operations for nonrail purposes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) will not use any funds or assets from high-speed rail operations for purposes other than high-speed rail purposes,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if such payments or use will impair the ability of such obligor to provide rail services or high-speed rail services in an efficient and economic manner or will adversely effect the ability of such obligor to perform any obligation guaranteed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligor shall not be restricted with respect to making dividend payments from its net income for any fiscal year, if such payments do not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when compared to the net income of such obligor for such fiscal year, the ratio which aggregate dividends paid by such obligor, during the 5 fiscal years prior to the granting of the earliest loan guarantee then outstanding under this section, bore to aggregate net income of such obligor for such period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 per centum of the total additions to the retained income of such obligor (computed on a cumulative basis and giving cognizance to dividends paid) during the period commencing with the fiscal year prior to the granting of the earliest loan guarantee then outstanding under this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The restrictions set forth in paragraphs (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to an obligation guaranteed under this section if, in the event of a default by the obligor, the Secretary would be subrogated to the rights of the lender under section 77(j) of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Breach of conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall commence a civil action in any appropriate district court of the United States to enjoin any activity which the Secretary finds is in violation of any requirement or condition specified in subsection (i) or (j)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#831_1_target" name="831_1">1</a></sup> of this section, and to secure any other appropriate relief, including termination, suspension, and punitive damages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Investigation charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall charge and collect from each applicant such amounts as he deems reasonable for the investigation of any application submitted under this section, for appraisal of the value of the equipment or facilities involved, and for making the necessary determinations and findings. Such charges shall not aggregate more than one-half of 1 percent of the principal amount of the obligation with respect to which the applicant seeks a guarantee or commitment to guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Premium charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall assess and collect from the obligor an annual premium charge on each obligation guaranteed under this section. The amount of such premium may not exceed an annual rate of 1 percent on the unpaid principal balance of such obligation at the time payment is due. Payment is due initially when the obligation is guaranteed by the Secretary, and, thereafter, on the anniversary date of such guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All moneys received by the Secretary under this section shall be deposited in the obligation guarantee fund, and to the extent provided in appropriation acts, may be used by the Secretary to pay administrative costs and expenses incurred by him pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) &ldquo;High-speed rail&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;high-speed rail&rdquo; means all forms of nonhighway ground transportation that run on rails providing transportation service which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reasonably expected to reach sustained speeds of more than 125 miles per hour; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) made available to members of the general public as passengers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term does not include rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not connected to the general rail system of transportation.</p>
