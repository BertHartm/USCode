<p class="statutory-body">An employee as defined in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act [45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.] who has, after June 30, 1960, and before April 1, 1962, exhausted (within the meaning prescribed by the Railroad Retirement Board by regulation) his right to unemployment benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, shall be paid unemployment benefits in accordance otherwise with the provisions of such Act for days of unemployment, not exceeding sixty-five, and not exceeding in the aggregate, an amount equal to 50 per centum of the total amount of unemployment benefits which were payable to him in the benefit year in which he last exhausted his rights before making his first claim under this chapter, which occur in registration periods, as defined in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, beginning on or after the fifteenth day after the date of enactment of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1961 [March 24, 1961], and before April 1, 1962, and which would not be days with respect to which he would be held entitled otherwise to receive unemployment benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act: <em>Provided</em>, That an employee entitled under this section to benefits for a day before April 1, 1962, may receive such benefits for days in registration periods which begin before July 1, 1962: <em>Provided further</em>, That payment of benefits otherwise provided for in this chapter shall not be made with respect to any individual for any day of unemployment to the extent that such payment, when added to the sum of the benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and under this chapter paid such individual with respect to prior days in the benefit year, would exceed one hundred and ninety-five times such individual's daily benefit rate for such benefit year. An employee who has filed, and established, a first claim for benefits under the provisions of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1961, may not thereafter establish a claim under this section, and an employee who has registered for, and established, a claim under this section may not thereafter establish a claim under the provisions of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1961.
