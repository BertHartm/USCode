<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) The term &ldquo;cost&rdquo; means the estimated long-term cost to the Government of a direct loan or loan guarantee or modification thereof, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The cost of a direct loan shall be the net present value, at the time when the direct loan is disbursed, of the following estimated cash flows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Loan disbursements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Repayments of principal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Payments of interest and other payments by or to the Government over the life of the loan after adjusting for estimated defaults, prepayments, fees, penalties, and other recoveries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Calculation of the cost of a direct loan shall include the effects of changes in loan terms resulting from the exercise by the borrower of an option included in the loan contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Payments by the Government to cover defaults and delinquencies, interest subsidies, or other payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Payments to the Government, including origination and other fees, penalties, and recoveries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Calculation of the cost of a loan guarantee shall include the effects of changes in loan terms resulting from the exercise by the guaranteed lender of an option included in the loan guarantee contract, or by the borrower of an option included in the guaranteed loan contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The cost of a modification is the difference between the current estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of a direct loan or loan guarantee contract, and the current estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the contract, as modified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In estimating net present values, the discount rate shall be the average interest rate on marketable Treasury securities of similar maturity to the cash flows of the direct loan or loan guarantee for which the estimate is being made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) When funds are obligated for a direct loan or loan guarantee, the estimated cost shall be based on the current assumptions, adjusted to incorporate the terms of the loan contract, for the fiscal year in which the funds are obligated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;current&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 900(c)(9) of title 2.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;direct loan&rdquo; means a disbursement of funds by the Government to a non-Federal borrower under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds. The term includes the purchase of, or participation in, a loan made by another lender and financing arrangements that defer payment for more than 90 days, including the sale of a Government asset on credit terms.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The term &ldquo;loan guarantee&rdquo; means any guarantee, insurance, or other pledge with respect to the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-Federal borrower to a non-Federal lender, but does not include the insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable accounts in financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term &ldquo;loan guarantee commitment&rdquo; means a binding agreement by the Secretary to make a loan guarantee when specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower, the lender, or any other party to the guarantee agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The term &ldquo;modification&rdquo; means any Government action that alters the estimated cost of an outstanding direct loan (or direct loan obligation) or an outstanding loan guarantee (or loan guarantee commitment) from the current estimate of cash flows. This includes the sale of loan assets, with or without recourse, and the purchase of guaranteed loans. This also includes any action resulting from new legislation, or from the exercise of administrative discretion under existing law, that di<!-- PDFPage:217 -->rectly or indirectly alters the estimated cost of outstanding direct loans (or direct loan obligations) or loan guarantees (or loan guarantee commitments) such as a change in collection procedures.</p>

When all obligations attached to a cohort of loans have been satisfied, credit risk premiums paid for the cohort, and interest accrued thereon, which were not used to mitigate losses shall be returned to the original source on a pro rata basis. A cohort may include loans and loan guarantees. The Secretary shall not establish any limit on the proportion of a cohort that may be used for 1 loan or loan guarantee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, before granting assistance under this section, require the applicant to agree to such terms and conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on such obligation, the applicant, and any railroad or railroad partner for whose benefit the assistance is intended&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will not use any funds or assets from railroad or intermodal operations for purposes not related to such operations, if such use would impair the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to provide rail or intermodal services in an efficient and economic manner, or would adversely affect the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to perform any obligation entered into by the applicant under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will, consistent with its capital resources, maintain its capital program, equipment, facilities, and operations on a continuing basis; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Fair and equitable arrangements shall be provided, in accordance with this section, to protect the interests of any employees not otherwise protected under title V of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (45 U.S.C. 771 et seq.), who may be affected by actions taken pursuant to authorizations or approval obtained under this subchapter. Such arrangements shall be determined by the execution of an agreement between the representatives of the railroads and the representatives of their employees, within 120 days after February 5, 1976. In the absence of such an executed agreement, the Secretary of Labor shall prescribe the applicable protective arrangements, within 150 days after February 5, 1976.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The arrangements required by subsection (a) of this section shall apply to each employee who has an employment relationship with a railroad on the date on which such railroad first applies for applicable financial assistance under this subchapter. Such arrangements shall include such provisions as may be necessary for the negotiation and execution of agreements as to the manner in which the protective arrangements shall be applied, including notice requirements. Such agreements shall be executed prior to implementation of work funded from financial assistance under this subchapter. If such an agreement is not reached within 30 days after the date on which an application for such assistance is approved, either party to the dispute may submit the issue for final and binding arbitration. The decision on any such arbitration shall be rendered within 30 days after such submission. Such arbitration decision shall in no way modify the protection afforded in the protective arrangements established pursuant to this section, shall be final and binding on the parties thereto, and shall become a part of the agreement.
