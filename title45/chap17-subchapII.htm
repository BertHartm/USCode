<h3 class="section-head">&sect;825. Rehabilitation and improvement financing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any railroad may apply to the Secretary, following October 19, 1976, and in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, for financial assistance for facilities rehabilitation and improvement financing and for such other financial assistance as may be approved by the Secretary. Any regulations promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to this section shall include specific and detailed standards in accordance with which the Secretary shall conduct the evaluations and make the determinations required in subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee or employee-shipper group may apply to the Secretary for financial assistance pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A financially responsible person may apply to the Secretary for financial assistance from funds made available pursuant to section 829(b)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#825_1_target" name="825_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;financially responsible person&rdquo; means a person who (i) is capable of paying the constitutional minimum value of the railroad line proposed to be acquired, and (ii) is able to assure that adequate transportation will be provided over such line for a period of not less than 3 years. Such term includes a governmental authority but does not include a class I or class II rail carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application and determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each application for facilities rehabilitation and improvement financing shall set forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description of the proposed facilities rehabilitation and improvement project for which such railroad is seeking financial assistance, and of the current physical condition of such facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the classification of each main and branch rail line included in such project, as determined in accordance with the final standards and designations under section 823(e) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the track standard under which each such line has been and is being operated and the reasons therefor, and the safety standards and signal requirements necessary under such standard to prevent loss of life and serious accident or injury at grade crossings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the track standard necessary, in the judgment of such railroad, to provide reliable and competitive freight service (and passenger service, where applicable) over each such line, together with such railroad's recommendations as to (i) the most economical method of improving the physical condition of each such line to meet such track standard, (ii) the cost of providing adequate safety standards and signals, and (iii) an economic analysis of the cost of such improvements in condition and in safety standards and signals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) such railroad's estimate as to the cost of labor and materials, and the date of completion, and its opinion as to the priority to be <!-- PDFPage:222 -->accorded such portions of the proposed project as are reasonably divisible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the amount and kind of Federal financial assistance required by such railroad in order to complete the proposed project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) such other information as the Secretary shall by regulation require to assist him in evaluating such application in accordance with this section or for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall act upon each such application within 6 months after the date on which all required information is received, except as otherwise provided in subsection (a)(2) of this section. The Secretary may approve any such application if he determines that providing the requested financial assistance is in the public interest. When making such a determination, the Secretary shall evaluate and consider in the following order of priority (A) the availability of funds from other sources at a cost which is reasonable under principles of prudent railroad financial management in light of the railroad's projected rate of return for the project to be financed and the railroad's rate of return on total capital (represented by the ratio which such carrier's net income, including interest on a long-term debt, bore to the sum of average shareholder's equity, long-term debt, and accumulated deferred income tax for fiscal year 1975) as determined in accordance with the uniform system of accounts promulgated by the Commission, (B) the interest of the public in supplementing such other funds as may be available in order to increase the total amount of funds available for railroad financing, and (C) the public benefits, including any significant railroad restructuring, to be realized from the project to be financed in relation to the public costs of such financing and whether the proposed project will return public benefits sufficient to justify such public costs. Except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, the Secretary, in determining the extent to which a project will provide public benefits, shall give the highest priority to projects which will enhance the ability of the applicant carrier or other carriers to provide essential freight services. With respect to funds appropriated for financial assistance under this section which were authorized pursuant to section 803(a) and (b) of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, applications for such funds for the purpose of coal transportation shall be deemed to be for the provision of essential freight services. The Secretary, in granting financial assistance to any applicant, shall assign the highest priority, among applications for assistance which would return equal public benefits, to applications for assistance for providing safety improvements and signals, including underpasses or overpasses at railroad crossings at which injury or loss of life has frequently occurred or is likely to occur. The Secretary shall assign the highest priorities (i) to those meritorious applications of carriers operating under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act unable to generate such funds in the private sector and (ii) to those meritorious applications for funds to provide for the restructuring of rail freight facilities and systems which handle more than two million rail cars annually, which are located in more than one State, and which are separated by the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may approve applications to provide financial assistance to any employee or employee-shipper ownership group formed pursuant to a plan for the purchase or rehabilitation of a line or lines of railroad or of rail facilities which are considered to be in the public interest. The Secretary shall not use more than 20 percent of the total funds available under this section for such financial assistance. In considering the allocation of available funds and priority of eligible projects under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the availability of viable alternatives to the ownership or rehabilitation by the eligible employee-shipper group for the continuation of rail service. Projects with no such alternative shall receive highest priority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Financing agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the approval of an application for financial assistance under this section, the Secretary shall promptly enter into an agreement with such railroad to provide financing in such amounts and at such times as is sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to meet the reasonable cost, in whole or in part, of the facilities rehabilitation and improvement project which has been approved, in whole or in part. Each such agreement shall include such terms and conditions as are necessary or appropriate, in the judgment of the Secretary, to assure that the financing will be used only in the manner, and for the purposes, approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of a railroad other than a railroad in reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, financing pursuant to this section shall be in the form of purchase by the Secretary of redeemable preference shares at par. Such shares shall be specifically issued for such purpose in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in section 826 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a railroad in reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, the Secretary, in order to provide financing pursuant to this section, may agree to purchase redeemable preference shares of such railroad at par as part of a plan of reorganization of such railroad approved by the court having jurisdiction over the reorganization of such railroad. Such shares shall be specifically issued in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in section 826 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary, in order to provide financing pursuant to this section, may also purchase certificates issued under section 77(c)(3) of the Bankruptcy Act by a trustee of a railroad in reorganization and approved by the reorganization court, under such terms and conditions as may be approved by the Secretary and the reorganization court. In purchasing such trustee certificates or at any time thereafter, the Secretary may agree with the trustee of such railroad in reorganization, subject to the approval of the reorganization court, to exchange such certificates for redeemable preference shares issued, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in section 826 of this title, in connection with a plan of reorganization approved <!-- PDFPage:223 -->by the reorganization court. Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, no certificate shall be purchased under this section unless and until the Secretary makes a finding in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such certificates cannot otherwise be sold at a reasonable rate of interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the project to be financed can reasonably be expected to be maintained as part of a financially self-sustaining railroad system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the probable value of the assets of the railroad in the event of liquidation provides reasonable protection to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may purchase certificates under this section without making the finding referred to in clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) only if such certificates are senior in rights to all outstanding capital stock, common and preferred, of the debtor corporation, and all unsecured debt incurred before the date of commencement of railroad reorganization proceedings pursuant to section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, but subordinate to all senior debt of the debtor corporation whenever such senior debt is incurred. As used in this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;senior debt&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) all costs of administration, incurred or to be incurred by a trustee, and secured debt assumed by a trustee, in connection with the reorganization proceedings and the operation of a debtor's business by a trustee during the pendency of such proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) all secured debt incurred before the date of commencement of railroad reorganization proceedings pursuant to section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act and determined by the court to be a proper claim against the estate and an obligation of the debtor corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a Government authority that applies for financial assistance from funds made available pursuant to section 829(b)(2)<sup><a href="#825_1_target" name="825_1">1</a></sup> of this title for the purchase or rehabilitation of railroad lines purchased under section 10910&nbsp;<sup><a href="#825_1_target" name="825_1">1</a></sup> of title 49, financing pursuant to this section shall be in the form of purchase by the Secretary of bonds or other debt obligations issued for such purpose by such Government authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total par value of the redeemable preference shares and the amount of trustee certificates, bonds, and other debt obligations which the Secretary may purchase from the proceeds received from the issuance and sale of Fund anticipation notes shall not exceed $1,400,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Future purchases of redeemable preference shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total par value of the redeemable preference shares which the Secretary may, after September 30, 1985, make commitments to purchase under this subchapter, shall be determined by the Congress following the receipt by the Congress of the Secretary's recommendations as to the scope and sources of funding of the Fund or any recommended alternative financing mechanism, as submitted pursuant to section 824 of this title, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of the Secretary's investment in redeemable preference shares in any fiscal year (out of proceeds other than those derived through the issuance and sale of Fund anticipation notes) shall not, when added to the amount of his prior investment in such shares, exceed 200 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the Fund bonds which (A) have been issued by the Secretary prior to such fiscal year, and (B) are projected to be issued by the Secretary through the end of such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) neither redemptions of Fund bonds nor their payment at scheduled maturity shall have any bearing on the limitation in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rehabilitation for common carrier service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e) of this section (other than subsection (d)(3) of this section), the Secretary shall immediately purchase redeemable preference shares or trustee certificates convertible to redeemable preference shares under this section as necessary to facilitate the rehabilitation and improvement of Milwaukee Railroad property that has been sold or transferred to another person or retained by the restructured Milwaukee Railroad and that will be used for common carrier rail service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not take any action under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prior to (i) the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b) of this title, or (ii) April 1, 1980, whichever first occurs; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after April 1, 1981.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Funds received from purchases by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection may not be used for the rehabilitation and improvement of any line of railroad which carried less than an average of 3,000,000 gross tons of freight per mile per year during the previous three-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not more than 50 percent of the funds made available at any time for the purchase of redeemable preference shares and trustee certificates under this section may be used for the rehabilitation and improvement of the facilities of any single railroad undergoing restructuring.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Purchase of essential properties for common carrier service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (g) of this section (other than subsections (b)(2) and (d)(3) of this section), the Secretary shall, upon application of a noncarrier entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) purchase, from funds available on May 1, 1980, not less than $38,000,000 in redeemable preference shares, bonds, or trustee certificates convertible to redeemable preference shares under this section as necessary for the purchase, lease, or rehabilitation of properties of the Rock Island Railroad by responsible noncarrier entities to be used for common carrier rail service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) purchase not more than $27,000,000 in redeemable preference shares or trustee certificates convertible to redeemable preference shares under this section as necessary for the purchase of properties of the Milwaukee Railroad by responsible noncarrier entities to be used for common carrier rail service, to the extent that the Secretary determines that funds are available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Preference shares, bonds, and trustee certificates purchased under this subsection shall <!-- PDFPage:224 -->be purchased under terms and conditions that insure that the applicant will be financially capable of making the requisite dividend or interest and redemption or principal payments without impairing its financial resources, and the Secretary shall insure that all assistance provided under this subsection is likely to be repaid or can be secured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A)(i) For purposes of this subsection, a responsible noncarrier entity may include an association composed of representatives of national railway labor organizations, employee coalitions, shippers, or any combination thereof, and States or State organizations, which wish to acquire, lease, or rehabilitate properties of the Rock Island Railroad or the Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to a feasible employee, employee-shipper, or State ownership plan. A responsible noncarrier entity may also include any railroad that wishes to contribute any of its properties under common ownership with the property being acquired by the association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Any ownership plan described in clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be submitted to the Secretary no later than August 20, 1980, or such later date as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection, the return on redeemable preference shares shall be the minimum established pursuant to section 826(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection shall apply to (A) purchase offers submitted to the Trustee of the Rock Island Railroad Estate and filed with the Commission prior to September 15, 1980 (or such other time as the Secretary considers appropriate), and (B) purchase applications filed with the Commission prior to September 15, 1980 (or such other time as the Secretary considers appropriate) and approved by the court having jurisdiction over the reorganization of the Rock Island Railroad or the Milwaukee Railroad, as the case may be, and by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Financial assistance made available under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection may be used to purchase, for purposes of rail banking, properties of the Milwaukee Railroad located in the State of Montana with respect to which an interest in future rail common carrier operations has been evidenced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Applications for rail banking shall be treated equally with other applications for transaction assistance.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;828. Fund bonds</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Issuance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, following enactment of the legislation referred to in section 827(c) of this title, issue Fund bonds in denominations of $100,000 (or any integral multiple thereof), in such total amounts as may be authorized by the Congress. No Fund bonds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be issued which mature in less than 8, or more than 15, years from the date of original issuance thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be issued later than the 10th anniversary of the date of publication of the final standards and designations under section 823(e) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall, except as otherwise provided pursuant to subsections (d)(6) and (g) of this section, <!-- PDFPage:228 -->be subject to redemption (at the option of the Secretary) (A) at any time prior to the 10th anniversary of the date of original issuance thereof, and (B) at any time thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Pledge and lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, subject to subsection (g) of this section and section 822(g) of this title, shall impose a first pledge of, and a first lien on, all revenues payable to, and assets held in, the Fund, and appropriated for the use of the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter. The Secretary may impose such a pledge of and lien on all other revenues or property of the Fund. The purpose of any such pledge and lien shall be to secure the payment, when due, of the principal of, any redemption premiums on, and any interest on, all Fund anticipation notes and Fund bonds, and for other purposes incidental thereto. Such incidental purposes may include the creation of reserve and other funds which may be similarly pledged and used, to such extent and in such manner as the Secretary deems necessary or desirable. Any pledge made by the Secretary shall be valid and binding from the time it is made. The revenues and assets held in the Fund, and the revenues or property of the Fund which are so pledged and which are subsequently received by the Fund, shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or any further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind, in tort, contract, or otherwise, against the Secretary or the Fund, without regard to whether such parties have notice thereof. No instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded or filed to protect such pledge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enhancement of marketability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into binding covenants with the holders of Fund bonds, and with the trustee, if any, under any agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of such bonds with respect to (1) the establishment of reserves, and other funds; (2) stipulations concerning the subsequent issuance of obligations; and (3) such other matters as the Secretary deems necessary or desirable to enhance the marketability of Fund bonds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Specific determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may determine, with respect to Fund bonds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the form and denominations in which they shall be issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the time when they shall be sold, and in what amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the time when they shall mature;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the price thereof at sale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the rate of interest thereon;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) whether, and in what manner, they may be redeemed prior to the date when they mature; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) whether they shall be negotiable or nonnegotiable and whether they shall be bearer or registered instruments, and any indentures or covenants relating thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Characteristics</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Fund bonds issued by the Secretary under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) contain a recital that they are issued under this section, which shall be conclusive evidence as to the validity and regularity of issuance and sale of such Fund bonds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be subject to such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may, by the resolution authorizing their issuance, determine;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) be lawful investments and may be accepted as security for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds, the investment or deposit of which shall be under the authority or control of any officer or agency of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) not be exempted from Federal, State, and local taxation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) not be debts or enforceable general obligations of, nor shall payment of the principal thereof or interest thereon be guaranteed by, the United States. Neither the full faith and credit, nor the general taxing power, of the Federal Government shall be pledged to the payment of the principal of, any premium on, or interest on, such Fund bonds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) No personal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither the Secretary, nor any other individual, who executes any Fund anticipation notes or Fund bonds, shall be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of any such notes or bonds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Redemption and transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after the 10th anniversary date of the original issuance of the initial series of Fund bonds, the amount in the Fund, exclusive of the value of any redeemable preference shares held by the Fund, exceeds 250 percent of the amount required to satisfy amounts due in the succeeding fiscal year on account of Fund bonds, the Secretary may use such excess to redeem Fund bonds in accordance with their terms or may withdraw all or part of such excess from the Fund and transfer it to the general fund of the United States. When all Fund bonds have been redeemed, all amounts remaining in the Fund or thereafter accruing to it shall be transferred to the general fund of the United States, except to the extent necessary to cover such expenses of the Fund as may be required to carry on and complete any remaining responsibilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Purchase by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, subject to such agreements with holders of Fund bonds as may then exist, is authorized (out of any funds available) to purchase Fund anticipation notes or Fund bonds. Upon any such purchase, such bonds and notes shall be canceled.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;831. Guarantee of obligations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, guarantee and make commitments to guarantee the payment of the principal balance of, and any interest on, an obligation of an applicant prior to, on, or after the date of execution or the date of disbursement of such obligation, if the proceeds of such obligation shall be or have been used (1) to acquire or to rehabilitate and improve facilities or equipment (which includes but is not limited to computerized car management systems), (2) to develop or establish new railroad facilities, or (3) to acquire, rehabilitate, improve, develop, or establish high-speed rail facilities or equipment. Each guarantee of such an obligation shall be made in accordance with the provisions of sections 831 through 833 of this title and such rules as the Secretary may prescribe to protect reasonably the interest of the United States. Each application for the guarantee of such an obligation or for a commitment to guarantee such an obligation shall be made in writing to the Secretary in such form and with such content as the Secretary prescribes. Such application shall be granted, in whole or in part, if the Secretary determines that the proposed, negotiated, or executed obligation is eligible for such guarantee. Each such guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall be extended in such form, under such terms and conditions, and pursuant to such regulations as the Secretary deems appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter. Such a guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall inure to the benefit of the holder of the obligation to which such guarantee or commitment to guarantee applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligation guarantee fund shall be established and administered by the Secretary as a revolving fund to carry out the provisions of sections 831 through 833 of this title. Moneys in the obligation guarantee fund shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of such fund or invested in bonds or other obligations of the United States approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Full faith and credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All guarantees entered into by the Secretary under this section shall constitute general obligations of the United States of America backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may approve any modification of any provision of a guarantee, or of a commitment to guarantee an obligation, including the rate of interest, time of payment of interest or principal, security, or any other terms and conditions, if the Secretary makes a finding in writing that such modification is equitable and is in the overall best interests of the United States under this subchapter, and that the holder of such obligation consents to such modification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Extent of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate unpaid principal amounts of obligations which may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this section shall not exceed $1,000,000,000 at any one time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rate of interest (exclusive of premium charges for a guarantee and service fees) which shall be paid on the unpaid principal balance of each obligation guaranteed by the Secretary under this section, shall not exceed an annual percentage rate which the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into consideration the prevailing interest rates for similar obligations in the private market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prerequisites for guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No obligation shall be guaranteed and no commitment shall be made to guarantee any obligation under this section, unless and until the Secretary makes a finding in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an obligation for equipment acquisition, rehabilitation, or improvement is secured (A) by the particular equipment which is to be financed or refinanced by such obligation, or (B) in the case of the rehabilitation or improvement of leased equipment, by the lease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) payment of the obligation is required by its terms to be made within 25 years from the date of its execution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financing or refinancing is justified by the present and probable future demand for <!-- PDFPage:231 -->rail services or high-speed rail services to be rendered by the applicant and will serve to meet demonstrable needs for rail services or high-speed rail services and to provide shippers or passengers with improved service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the applicant has given reasonable assurances that the facilities or equipment to be acquired, rehabilitated, improved, developed, or established with the proceeds of the obligation will be economically and efficiently utilized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the prospective earning power of the applicant, or the value or prospective earning power of any equipment or facilities to be acquired, rehabilitated, improved, developed, or established (or any combination of the foregoing), together with any other security offered by the applicant, is sufficient to provide the United States with reasonable security and protection, except that if the value or prospective earning power of such equipment or facilities is equal to or greater than the amount of the obligation to be guaranteed, the Secretary may not, on the basis of the lack of prospective earning power of the applicant, find that the United States will not be provided with the reasonable security and protection referred to in this paragraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the transaction will result in an improvement in the ability of any affected railroad or high-speed rail carrier to transport passengers or freight; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in the case of high-speed rail facilities and equipment, at least 85 percent of such facilities and equipment are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, unless the Secretary finds in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such requirement would be inconsistent with the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such facilities and equipment could not be mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a satisfactory quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such a requirement would increase the cost of the facilities and equipment by more than 25 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such a requirement would result in a violation of obligations of the United States under international trade agreements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) General requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The recipients of any guarantees of, or of any commitments to guarantee, an obligation under this section, shall, consistent with their capital resources, maintain their facilities, on a continuing basis, in accordance with standards promulgated under this subsection. The Secretary shall assure compliance with this requirement by regular periodic inspection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Conditions of guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, before making, approving, or extending any guarantee or commitment to guarantee any obligation under this section, require the obligor to agree to such terms and conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to assure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on such obligation, such obligor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will not make any discretionary dividend payments, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) will not use any funds or assets from railroad operations for nonrail purposes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) will not use any funds or assets from high-speed rail operations for purposes other than high-speed rail purposes,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if such payments or use will impair the ability of such obligor to provide rail services or high-speed rail services in an efficient and economic manner or will adversely effect the ability of such obligor to perform any obligation guaranteed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligor shall not be restricted with respect to making dividend payments from its net income for any fiscal year, if such payments do not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when compared to the net income of such obligor for such fiscal year, the ratio which aggregate dividends paid by such obligor, during the 5 fiscal years prior to the granting of the earliest loan guarantee then outstanding under this section, bore to aggregate net income of such obligor for such period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 per centum of the total additions to the retained income of such obligor (computed on a cumulative basis and giving cognizance to dividends paid) during the period commencing with the fiscal year prior to the granting of the earliest loan guarantee then outstanding under this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The restrictions set forth in paragraphs (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to an obligation guaranteed under this section if, in the event of a default by the obligor, the Secretary would be subrogated to the rights of the lender under section 77(j) of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Breach of conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall commence a civil action in any appropriate district court of the United States to enjoin any activity which the Secretary finds is in violation of any requirement or condition specified in subsection (i) or (j)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#831_1_target" name="831_1">1</a></sup> of this section, and to secure any other appropriate relief, including termination, suspension, and punitive damages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Investigation charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall charge and collect from each applicant such amounts as he deems reasonable for the investigation of any application submitted under this section, for appraisal of the value of the equipment or facilities involved, and for making the necessary determinations and findings. Such charges shall not aggregate more than one-half of 1 percent of the principal amount of the obligation with respect to which the applicant seeks a guarantee or commitment to guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Premium charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall assess and collect from the obligor an annual premium charge on each obligation guaranteed under this section. The amount of such premium may not exceed an annual rate of 1 percent on the unpaid principal balance of such obligation at the time payment <!-- PDFPage:232 -->is due. Payment is due initially when the obligation is guaranteed by the Secretary, and, thereafter, on the anniversary date of such guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All moneys received by the Secretary under this section shall be deposited in the obligation guarantee fund, and to the extent provided in appropriation acts, may be used by the Secretary to pay administrative costs and expenses incurred by him pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) &ldquo;High-speed rail&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;high-speed rail&rdquo; means all forms of nonhighway ground transportation that run on rails providing transportation service which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reasonably expected to reach sustained speeds of more than 125 miles per hour; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) made available to members of the general public as passengers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term does not include rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not connected to the general rail system of transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may issue, in such amounts as are provided in appropriation acts, notes or other obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury, in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. Such obligations may be issued whenever the moneys in the obligation guarantee fund are not sufficient to pay any amount which the Secretary is required to pay under section 833 of this title. Such obligations shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States on comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any such obligations, and for such purpose he may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force. The purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchase of notes or other obligations issued under this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury may sell any such obligations at such times and price and upon such terms and conditions as he shall determine in his discretion. All purchases, redemptions, and sales of such obligations by such Secretary shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States. Moneys obtained under this subsection shall be deposited in the obligation guarantee <!-- PDFPage:234 -->fund, and redemptions of any such obligations shall be made by the Secretary from such fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Validity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No guarantee or commitment to guarantee under section 831 of this title may be terminated, suspended, canceled, or otherwise revoked, except in accordance with lawful terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary. Such a guarantee or commitment shall be conclusive evidence that the underlying obligation is in compliance with the provisions of such sections of this subchapter, and that such obligation has been approved and is legal as to principal, interest, and other terms. Such a guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall be valid and incontestable in the hands of the holder thereof, as of the date when the Secretary granted the application therefor, except as to fraud or material misrepresentation by such holder.</p>

Such payment may be demanded after or before the expiration of such period as may be specified in the guarantee or related agreements, but not later than 90 days from the date of such default. Within such specified period, but not later than 60 days from the date of such demand, the Secretary shall pay to such holder the unpaid interest on, and the unpaid principal of, such obligation, consistent with the terms of the guarantee of such obligation, except that (1) the Secretary shall not be required to make any such payment if he finds, prior to the expiration of such period, that there was no default by the obligor in the payment of interest or principal or that such default has been remedied, and (2) no such holder shall receive payment or be entitled to retain payment in a total amount which, together with an other recovery (including any recovery based upon a security interest in equipment or facilities) exceeds the actual loss of such holder.</p>

Such an action may be brought in the name of the United States or in the name of the holder of such obligation. Such holder shall make available to the Secretary all records and evidence necessary to prosecute any such suit. The Secretary may, in his discretion, accept a conveyance of property in full or partial satisfaction of any sums owed to him. If the Secretary receives, through the sale of property, an amount greater than his cost and the amount paid to the holder under subsection (a) of this section, he shall pay such excess to the obligor.</p>
