<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Loan guarantees</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of or in combination with appropriations of budget authority to cover the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees as required under section 661c(b)(1) of title 2, the Secretary may accept on behalf of an applicant for assistance under this section a commitment from a non-Federal source to fund in whole or in part credit risk premiums with respect to the loan that is the subject of the application. In no event shall the aggregate of appropriations of budget authority and credit risk premiums described in this paragraph with respect to a direct loan or loan guarantee be less than the cost of that direct loan or loan guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit risk premium amount</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cohorts of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to maintain sufficient balances of credit risk premiums to adequately protect the Federal Government from risk of default, while minimizing the length of time the Government retains possession of those balances, the Secretary shall establish cohorts of loans. When all obligations attached to a cohort of loans have been satisfied, credit risk premiums paid for the cohort, and interest accrued thereon, which were not used to mitigate losses shall be returned to the original source on a pro rata basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prerequisites for assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not make a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section unless the Secretary has made a finding in writing that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the direct loan or loan guarantee is justified by the present and probable future demand for rail services or intermodal facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the applicant has given reasonable assurances that the facilities or equipment to be acquired, rehabilitated, improved, developed, or established with the proceeds of the obligation will be economically and efficiently utilized;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Conditions of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, before granting assistance under this section, require the applicant to agree to such terms and conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on such obligation, the applicant, and any railroad or railroad partner for whose benefit the assistance is intended&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will not use any funds or assets from railroad or intermodal operations for purposes not related to such operations, if such use would impair the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to provide rail or intermodal services in an efficient and economic manner, or would adversely affect the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to perform any obligation entered into by the applicant under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will, consistent with its capital resources, maintain its capital program, equipment, facilities, and operations on a continuing basis; and</p>
