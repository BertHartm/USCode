<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of the Congress in this Act to provide the means to rehabilitate and maintain the physical facilities, improve the operations and structure, and restore the financial stability of the railway system of the United States, and to promote the revitalization of such railway system, so that this mode of transportation will remain viable in the private sector of the economy and will be able to provide energy-efficient, ecologically compatible transportation services with greater efficiency, effectiveness, and economy, through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ratemaking and regulatory reform;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the encouragement of efforts to restructure the system on a more economically justified basis, including planning authority in the Secretary of Transportation, an expedited procedure for determining whether merger and consolidation applications are in the public interest, and continuing reorganization authority;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) permit railroads greater freedom to raise or lower rates for rail services in competitive markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) promote the establishment of railroad rate structures which are more sensitive to changes in the level of seasonal, regional, and shipper demand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) promote separate pricing of distinct rail and rail-related services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) The term &ldquo;cost&rdquo; means the estimated long-term cost to the Government of a direct loan or loan guarantee or modification thereof, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The cost of a direct loan shall be the net present value, at the time when the direct loan is disbursed, of the following estimated cash flows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Loan disbursements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Repayments of principal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Payments of interest and other payments by or to the Government over the life of the loan after adjusting for estimated defaults, prepayments, fees, penalties, and other recoveries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Payments by the Government to cover defaults and delinquencies, interest subsidies, or other payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Payments to the Government, including origination and other fees, penalties, and recoveries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:217 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Calculation of the cost of a loan guarantee shall include the effects of changes in loan terms resulting from the exercise by the guaranteed lender of an option included in the loan guarantee contract, or by the borrower of an option included in the guaranteed loan contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The cost of a modification is the difference between the current estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of a direct loan or loan guarantee contract, and the current estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the contract, as modified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In estimating net present values, the discount rate shall be the average interest rate on marketable Treasury securities of similar maturity to the cash flows of the direct loan or loan guarantee for which the estimate is being made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) When funds are obligated for a direct loan or loan guarantee, the estimated cost shall be based on the current assumptions, adjusted to incorporate the terms of the loan contract, for the fiscal year in which the funds are obligated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;current&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 900(c)(9) of title 2.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;direct loan&rdquo; means a disbursement of funds by the Government to a non-Federal borrower under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds. The term includes the purchase of, or participation in, a loan made by another lender and financing arrangements that defer payment for more than 90 days, including the sale of a Government asset on credit terms.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of or in combination with appropriations of budget authority to cover the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees as required under section 661c(b)(1) of title 2, the Secretary may accept on behalf of an applicant for assistance under this section a commitment from a non-Federal source to fund in whole or in part credit risk premiums with respect to the loan that is the subject of the application.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cohorts of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to maintain sufficient balances of credit risk premiums to adequately protect the Federal Government from risk of default, while minimizing the length of time the Government retains possession of those balances, the Secretary shall establish cohorts of loans. When all obligations attached to a cohort of loans have been satisfied, credit risk premiums paid for the cohort, and interest accrued thereon, which were not used to mitigate losses shall be returned to the original source on a pro rata basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prerequisites for assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not make a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section unless the Secretary has made a finding in writing that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Conditions of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, before granting assistance under this section, require the applicant to agree to such terms and conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on such obligation, the applicant, and any railroad or railroad partner for whose benefit the assistance is intended&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will not use any funds or assets from railroad or intermodal operations for purposes not related to such operations, if such use would impair the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to provide rail or intermodal services in an efficient and economic manner, or would adversely affect the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to perform any obligation entered into by the applicant under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will, consistent with its capital resources, maintain its capital program, equipment, facilities, and operations on a continuing basis; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Fair and equitable arrangements shall be provided, in accordance with this section, to protect the interests of any employees not otherwise protected under title V of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (45 U.S.C. 771 et seq.), who may be affected by actions taken pursuant to authorizations or approval obtained under this subchapter. Such arrangements shall be determined by the execution of an agreement between the representatives of the railroads and the representatives of their employees, within 120 days after February 5, 1976. In the absence of such an executed agreement, the Secretary of Labor shall prescribe the applicable protective arrangements, within 150 days after February 5, 1976.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The arrangements required by subsection (a) of this section shall apply to each employee who has an employment relationship with a railroad on the date on which such railroad first applies for applicable financial assistance under this subchapter. Such arrangements shall include such provisions as may be necessary for the negotiation and execution of agreements as to the manner in which the protective arrangements shall be applied, including notice requirements. Such agreements shall be executed prior to implementation of work funded from financial assistance under this subchapter. If such an agreement is not reached within 30 days after the date on which an application for such assistance is approved, either party to the dispute may submit the issue for final and binding arbitration. The decision on any such arbitration shall be rendered within 30 days after such submission. Such arbitration decision shall in no way modify the protection afforded in the protective arrangements established pursuant to this section, shall be final and binding on the parties thereto, and shall become a part of the agreement. Such arrangements shall also include such provisions as may be necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for the preservation of compensation (including subsequent general wage increases, vacation allowances, and monthly compensation guarantees), rights, privileges, and benefits (including fringe benefits such as pensions, hospitalization, and vacations, under the same conditions and so long as such benefits continue to be accorded to other employees of the employing railroad in active service or on furlough, as the case may be) to such employees under existing collective-bargaining agreements or otherwise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide for final and binding arbitration of any dispute which cannot be settled by the parties, with respect to the interpretation, application, or enforcement of the provisions of the protective arrangements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide that an employee who is unable to secure employment by the exercise of his or her seniority rights, as a result of actions taken with financial assistance obtained under this subchapter, shall be offered reassignment and, where necessary, retraining to fill a position comparable to the position held at the time of such adverse effect and for which he is, or by training and retraining can become, physically and mentally qualified, so long as such offer is not in contravention of collective bargaining agreements relating thereto; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide that the protection afforded pursuant to this section shall not be applicable to employees benefited solely as a result of the work which is financed by funds provided pursuant to this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Subcontracting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The arrangements which are required to be negotiated by the parties or prescribed by the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, shall include provisions regulating subcontracting by the railroads of work which is financed by funds provided pursuant to this subchapter.</p>
