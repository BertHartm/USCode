<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) uninterrupted continuation of services over Rock Island lines is dependent on adequate employee protection provisions covering Rock Island Railroad employees who are not hired by other railroads;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for those Rock Island Railroad employees not hired by other rail carriers, there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to <!-- PDFPage:235 -->meet the necessary costs of such employee protection that are assumed by the Rock Island Railroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a cessation of necessary operations of the Rock Island Railroad would have serious repercussions on the economies of the States in which such railroad principally operates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) premature cessation of services over lines which are the subject of pending purchase application would result in harm to the shipping public and could imperil continuation of vital commuter service.</p>
