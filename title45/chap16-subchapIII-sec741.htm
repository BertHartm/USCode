The Corporation shall be deemed a rail carrier subject to part A of subtitle IV of title 49, shall be subject to the provisions of this Act and, to the extent not inconsistent with such Act and subtitle IV of title 49, shall be subject to applicable State law. The principal office of the Corporation or of its principal railroad operating subsidiary shall be located in Philadelphia in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Incorporators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The members of the executive committee of the Association shall be the incorporators of the Corporation and shall take whatever steps are necessary to establish the Corporation, including the filing of articles of incorporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, after February 5, 1976, the members of the executive committee of the Association (including duly authorized representatives of members who are authorized by this chapter to be represented) and the chief executive officer and chief operating officer of the Corporation shall adopt the bylaws of the Corporation and serve as the Board of Directors of the Corporation until all members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation have been selected in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. The chief executive officer shall serve as chairman of such Board until a chairman thereof is selected pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, after which time such chairman shall serve at the pleasure of such Board.</p>
