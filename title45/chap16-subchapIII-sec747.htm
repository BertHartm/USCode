Any such audit may be conducted under such rules and regulations as the Comptroller General may prescribe.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amounts and causes of deviations, if any, from the financial projections of the final system plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount of Federal funds made available to the Corporation and a clear description of the uses of such funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the projected financial needs of the Corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the projected sources from which such financial needs are likely to be met; and</p>

On or before the end of such 90-day period, the Association shall submit to the Congress such methodological information and additional information which the Association deems necessary or appropriate to further the purpose of this subchapter.</p>
