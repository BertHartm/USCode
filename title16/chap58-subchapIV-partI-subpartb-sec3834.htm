<p class="statutory-body">(1) In making cost sharing payments to an owner or operator under a contract entered into under this subpart, the Secretary shall pay 50 percent of the cost of establishing water quality and conservation measures and practices required under such contracts for which the Secretary determines that cost-sharing is appropriate and in the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may permit owners or operators who contract to devote at least 10 acres of land to the production of hardwood trees under this subpart to extend the planting of such trees over a 3-year period if at least one-third of such trees are planted in each of the first 2 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An owner or operator shall not be eligible to receive or retain cost share assistance under this subsection if such owner or operator receives any other Federal cost share assistance with respect to such land under any other provision of law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In determining the amount of annual rental payments to be paid to owners and operators for converting highly erodible cropland normally devoted to the production of an agricultural commodity to less intensive use, the Secretary may consider, among other things, the amount necessary to encourage owners or operators of highly erodible cropland to participate in the program established by this subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amounts payable to owners or operators in the form of rental payments under contracts entered into under this subpart may be determined through&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other means as the Secretary determines are appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining the acceptability of contract offers, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) take into consideration the extent to which enrollment of the land that is the subject of the contract offer would improve soil resources, water quality, wildlife habitat, or provide other environmental benefits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish different criteria in various States and regions of the United States based <!-- PDFPage:2066 -->upon the extent to which water quality or wildlife habitat may be improved or erosion may be abated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of acreage enrolled in the conservation reserve established under this subpart that is to be devoted to hardwood trees, the Secretary may consider bids for contracts under this subsection on a continuous basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may be made in advance of determination of performance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If such payment is made with in-kind commodities, such payment shall be made by the Commodity Credit Corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by delivery of the commodity involved to the owner or operator at a warehouse or other similar facility located in the county in which the highly erodible cropland is located or at such other location as is agreed to by the Secretary and the owner or operator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by the transfer of negotiable warehouse receipts; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) by such other method, including the sale of the commodity in commercial markets, as is determined by the Secretary to be appropriate to enable the owner or operator to receive efficient and expeditious possession of the commodity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If stocks of a commodity acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation are not readily available to make full payment in kind to the owner or operator, the Secretary may substitute full or partial payment in cash for payment in kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Payments to a producer under a special conservation reserve enhancement program described in subsection (f)(4) of this section shall be in the form of cash only.</p>
