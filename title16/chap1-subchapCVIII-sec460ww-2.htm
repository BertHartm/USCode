When any tract of land is only partly within such boundaries, the Secretary may acquire all or any portion of the land outside of such boundaries in order to minimize the payment of severance costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Lands, waters and interests therein within the recreation area which are administered by any other agency of the United States and which are not identified under section 460ww&ndash;1 of this title as directly related to the Summersville project and essential to the operation of that project shall be transferred without reimbursement to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection of existing project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this Act shall impair or affect the requirements of section 1102 of Public Law 99&ndash;662 or otherwise affect the authorities of any department or agency of the United States to carry out the project purposes of the Summersville project, including recreation. In releasing water from such project, in order to protect public health and safety and to provide for enjoyment of the resources within the recreation area, other departments and agencies of the United States shall cooperate with the Secretary to facilitate and enhance whitewater recreational use and other recreational use of the recreation area.</p>
