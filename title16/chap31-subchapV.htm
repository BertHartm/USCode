<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the Marine Mammal Commission, and individuals with knowledge and experience in marine science, marine mammal science, marine mammal veterinary and husbandry practices, and marine conservation, including stranding network participants, establish a program to be known as the &ldquo;Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the Program shall be to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) facilitate the collection and dissemination of reference data on the health of marine mammals and health trends of marine mammal populations in the wild;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) correlate the health of marine mammals and marine mammal populations, in the wild, with available data on physical, chemical, and biological environmental parameters; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) coordinate effective responses to unusual mortality events by establishing a process in the Department of Commerce in accordance with section 1421c of this title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 3002 of Pub. L. 102&ndash;587 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Current stranding network participants have performed an undeniably valuable and ceaseless job of responding to marine mammal strandings over the last 15 years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Insufficient understanding of the connection between marine mammal health and the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of their environment prevents an adequate understanding of the causes of marine mammal unusual mortality events.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) An accurate assessment of marine mammal health, health trends in marine mammal populations in the wild, and causes of marine mammal unusual mortality events cannot be made without adequate reference data on marine mammals and the environment in which they live.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) A systematic assessment of the sources, presence, levels, and effects of potentially harmful contaminants on marine mammals would provide a better understanding of some of the causes of marine mammal unusual mortality events and may serve as an indicator of the general health of our coastal and marine environments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Responses to marine mammal unusual mortality events are often uncoordinated, due to the lack of sufficient contingency planning.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Standardized methods for the reporting of dying, dead, or otherwise incapacitated marine mammals in the wild would greatly assist in the determination of the causes of marine mammal unusual mortality events and enhance general knowledge of marine mammal species.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) A formal system for collection, preparation, and archiving of, and providing access to, marine mammal tissues will enhance efforts to investigate the health of marine mammals and health trends of marine mammal populations, and to develop reference data.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Information on marine mammals, including results of analyses of marine mammal tissues, should be broadly available to the scientific community, including stranding network participants, through a marine mammal data base.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) determining, after an unusual mortality event has begun, if response actions with respect to that event are no longer necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) developing the contingency plan in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, to assist the Secretary in responding to unusual mortality events.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 App. U.S.C.) shall not apply to the marine mammal unusual mortality event working group established under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) within 24 hours after receiving notification from a stranding network participant that an unusual mortality event might be occurring, contact as many members as is possible of the unusual mortality event working group for guidance; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1531 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) within 48 hours after receiving such notification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) make a determination as to whether an unusual mortality event is occurring;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The contingency plan required under this subsection shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a list of persons, including stranding network participants, at a regional, State, and local level, who can assist the Secretary in implementing a coordinated and effective response to an unusual mortality event;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the types of marine mammal tissues and analyses necessary to assist in diagnosing causes of unusual mortality events;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An Onsite Coordinator so designated shall be one or more appropriate Regional Directors of the National Marine Fisheries Service or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or their designees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If, because of the wide geographic distribution, multiple species of marine mammals involved, or magnitude of an unusual mortality event, more than one Onsite Coordinator is designated, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, designate which of the Onsite Coordinators shall have primary responsibility with respect to the event.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Functions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An Onsite Coordinator designated under this subsection shall coordinate and direct the activities of all persons responding to an unusual mortality event in accordance with the contingency plan issued under subsection (b) of this section, except that&mdash;</p>
