<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Review of civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under this subsection may obtain review in the United States district court for the appropriate district by filing a complaint in such court not later than 30 days after the date of such order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Collection of penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty under this section after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Presumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this section there is a rebuttable presumption that all sanctuary resources found on board a vessel that is used or seized in connection with a violation of this chapter or of any regulation or permit issued under this chapter were taken or retained in violation of this chapter or of a regulation or permit issued under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of storage, care, and other costs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Expenditures</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) pay a reward to any person who furnishes information leading to an assessment of a civil penalty, or to a forfeiture of property, for a violation of this chapter or any regulation or permit issued under this chapter; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Liability for costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person assessed a civil penalty for a violation of this chapter or of any regulation or permit issued under this chapter, and any claimant in a forfeiture action brought for such a violation, shall be liable for the reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary in storage, care, and maintenance of any sanctuary resource or other property seized in connection with the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Subpoenas</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use of resources of State and other Federal agencies</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Injunctive relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that there is an imminent risk of destruction or loss of or injury to a sanctuary resource, or that there has been actual destruction or loss of, or injury to, a sanctuary resource which may give rise to liability under section 1443 of this title, the Attorney General, upon request of the Secretary, shall seek to obtain such relief as may be necessary to abate such risk or actual destruction, loss, or injury, or to restore or replace the sanctuary resource, or both. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction in such a case to order such relief as the public interest and the equities of the case may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Area of application and enforceability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The area of application and enforceability of this chapter includes the territorial sea of the United States, as described in Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988, which is subject to the sovereignty of the United States, and the United States exclusive economic zone, consistent with international law.</p>
