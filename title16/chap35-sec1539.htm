<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any taking otherwise prohibited by section 1538(a)(1)(B) of this title if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No permit may be issued by the Secretary authorizing any taking referred to in paragraph (1)(B) unless the applicant therefor submits to the Secretary a conservation plan that specifies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the impact which will likely result from such taking;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) what steps the applicant will take to minimize and mitigate such impacts, and the funding that will be available to implement such steps;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) what alternative actions to such taking the applicant considered and the reasons why such alternatives are not being utilized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) such other measures that the Secretary may require as being necessary or appropriate for purposes of the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary finds, after opportunity for public comment, with respect to a permit application and the related conservation plan that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the taking will be incidental;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) substantial economic loss to persons who, for the year prior to the notice of consideration of such species as an endangered species, derived a substantial portion of their income from the lawful taking of any listed species, which taking would be made unlawful under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) curtailment of subsistence taking made unlawful under this chapter by persons (i) not reasonably able to secure other sources of subsistence; and (ii) dependent to a substantial extent upon hunting and fishing for subsistence; and (iii) who must engage in such curtailed taking for subsistence purposes.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Alaska natives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection the provisions of this chapter shall not apply with respect to the taking of any endangered species or threatened species, or the importation of any such species taken pursuant to this section, by&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, whenever the Secretary determines that any species of fish or wildlife which is subject to taking under the provisions of this subsection is an endangered species or threatened species, and that such taking materially and negatively affects the threatened or endangered species, he may prescribe regulations upon the taking of such species by any such Indian, Aleut, Eskimo, or non-Native Alaskan resident of an Alaskan native village. Such regulations may be established with reference to species, geographical description of the area included, the season for taking, or any other factors related to the reason for establishing such regulations and consistent with the policy of this chapter. Such regulations shall be prescribed after a notice and hearings in the affected judicial districts of Alaska and as otherwise required by section 1373 of this title, and shall be removed as soon as the Secretary determines that the need for their impositions has disappeared.</p>
