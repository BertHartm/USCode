<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3142. Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain resource assessment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to provide for a comprehensive and continuing inventory and assessment of the fish and wildlife resources of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; an analysis of the impacts of oil and gas exploration, development, and production, and to authorize exploratory activity within the coastal plain in a manner that avoids significant adverse effects on the fish and wildlife and other resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;coastal plain&rdquo; means that area identified as such in the map entitled &ldquo;Arctic National Wildlife Refuge&rdquo;, dated August 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;exploratory activity&rdquo; means surface geological exploration or seismic exploration, or both, for oil and gas within the coastal plain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Baseline study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with the Governor of the State, Native Village and Regional Corporations, and the North Slope Borough within the study area and interested persons, shall conduct a continuing study of the fish and wildlife (with special emphasis on caribou, wolves, wolverines, grizzly bears, migratory waterfowl, musk oxen, and polar bears) of the coastal plain and their habitat. In conducting the study, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) assess the size, range, and distribution of the populations of the fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determine the extent, location and carrying capacity of the habitats of the fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) assess the impacts of human activities and natural processes on the fish and wildlife and their habitats;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) analyze the potential impacts of oil and gas exploration, development, and production on such wildlife and habitats; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) analyze the potential effects of such activities on the culture and lifestyle (including subsistence) of affected Native and other people.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Within eighteen months after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall publish the results of the study as of that date and shall thereafter publish such revisions thereto as are appropriate as new information is obtained.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within two years after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall by regulation establish initial guidelines governing the carrying out of exploratory activities. The guidelines shall be based upon the results of the study required under subsection (c) of this section and such other information as may be available to the Secretary. The guidelines shall include such prohibitions, restrictions, and conditions on the carrying out of exploratory activities as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate to ensure that exploratory activities do not significantly adversely affect the fish and wildlife, their habitats, or the environment, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a prohibition on the carrying out of exploratory activity during caribou calving and immediate post-calving seasons or during any other period in which human activity may have adverse effects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) temporary or permanently closing of appropriate areas to such activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specification of the support facilities, equipment and related manpower that is appropriate in connection with exploratory activity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) requirements that exploratory activities be coordinated in such a manner as to avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The initial guidelines prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection shall be accompanied by an environmental impact statement on exploratory activities. The initial guidelines shall thereafter be revised to reflect changes made in the baseline study and other appropriate information made available to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exploration plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After the initial guidelines are prescribed under subsection (d) of this section, any person including the United States Geological Survey may submit one or more plans for exploratory activity (hereinafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;exploration plans&rdquo;) to the Secretary for approval. An exploration plan must set forth such information as the Secretary may require in order to determine whether the plan is consistent with the guidelines, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description and schedule of the exploratory activity proposed to be undertaken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of the equipment, facilities, and related manpower that would be used in carrying out the activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the area in which the activity would be undertaken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a statement of the anticipated effects that the activity may have on fish and wildlife, their habitats and the environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon receiving any exploration plan for approval, the Secretary shall promptly publish notice of the application and the text of the plan in the Federal Register and newspapers of general circulation in the State. The Secretary shall determine, within one hundred and twenty <!-- PDFPage:1700 -->days after any plan is submitted for approval, if the plan is consistent with the guidelines established under subsection (d) of this section. If the Secretary determines that the plan is so consistent, he shall approve the plan: except that no plan shall be approved during the two-year period following December 2, 1980. Before making the determination, the Secretary shall hold at least one public hearing in the State for purposes of receiving the comments and views of the public on the plan. The Secretary shall not approve of any plan submitted by the United States Geological Survey unless he determines that (1) no other person has submitted a plan for the area involved which meets established guidelines and (2) the information which would be obtained is needed to make an adequate report under subsection (h) of this section. The Secretary, as a condition of approval of any plan under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may require that such modifications be made to the plan as he considers necessary and appropriate to make it consistent with the guidelines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall require that all data and information (including processed, analyzed and interpreted information) obtained as a result of carrying out the plan shall be submitted to the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall make such data and information available to the public except that any processed, analyzed and interpreted data or information shall be held confidential by the Secretary for a period of not less than two years following any lease sale including the area from which the information was obtained and: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall prohibit by regulation any person who obtains access to such data and information from the Secretary or from any person other than a permittee from participation in any lease sale which includes the areas from which the information was obtained and from any commercial use of the information. The Secretary shall require that any permittee shall make available such data to any person at fair cost.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Modification to exploration plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If at any time while exploratory activity is being carried out under an exploration plan approved under subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary, on the basis of information available to him, determines that continuation of further activities under the plan or permit will significantly adversely affect fish or wildlife, their habitat, or the environment, the Secretary may suspend the carrying out of activities under the plan or permit for such time, make such modifications to the plan or to the terms and conditions of the permit (or both suspend and so modify) as he determines necessary and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Civil penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have violated any provision of a plan approved under subsection (e) of this section or any term or condition of a permit issued under subsection (f) of this section, or to have committed any act prohibited under subsection (d) of this section shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $10,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited act committed, and, with respect to the violator, the history of any prior offenses, his demonstrated good faith in attempting to achieve timely compliance after being cited for the violation, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under paragraph (1) may obtain review thereof in the appropriate district court of the United States by filing a notice of appeal in such court within thirty days from the date of such order and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such penalty imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court if they are not found to be supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2)(E) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty against him under paragraph (1) after it has become final, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under this subsection unless the matter is pending in court for judicial review or recovery of assessment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not earlier than five years after December 2, 1980, and not later than five years and nine months after such date, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to Congress a report containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the identification by means other than drilling of exploratory wells of those areas within the coastal plain that have oil and gas production potential and estimate of the volume of the oil and gas concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the description of the fish and wildlife, their habitats, and other resources that are within the areas identified under paragraph (1);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Canada has discovered commercial quantities of oil and gas in the Amalagak region of the Northwest Territory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Canada is exploring alternatives for transporting the oil from the Amalagak field to markets in Asia and the Far East;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) one of the options the Canadian Government is exploring involves transshipment of oil from the Amalagak field across the Beaufort Sea to tankers which would transport the oil overseas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the tankers would traverse the American Exclusive Economic Zone through the Beaufort Sea into the Chuckchi Sea and then through the Bering Straits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the Beaufort and Chuckchi Seas are vital to Alaska's Native people, providing them with subsistence in the form of walrus, seals, fish, and whales;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the Secretary of the Interior has conducted Outer Continental Shelf lease sales in the Beaufort and Chuckchi Seas and oil and gas exploration is ongoing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) an oil spill in the Arctic Ocean, if not properly contained and cleaned up, could have significant impacts on the indigenous people <!-- PDFPage:1702 -->of Alaska's North Slope and on the Arctic environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) there are no international contingency plans involving our two governments concerning containment and cleanup of an oil spill in the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Governor of Alaska, shall conduct a study of the issues of recovery of damages, contingency plans, and coordinated actions in the event of an oil spill in the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall, no later than January 31, 1991, transmit a report to the Congress on the findings and conclusions reached as the result of the study carried out under this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment; restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish, pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], an oil and gas leasing program on the Federal lands of Alaska not subject to the study required by section 3141 of this title, other than lands included in the National Petroleum Reserve&mdash;Alaska. Such program shall not be undertaken by the Secretary on those lands where applicable law prohibits such leasing or on those units of the National Wildlife Refuge System where the Secretary determines, after having considered the national interest in producing oil and gas from such lands, that the exploration for and development of oil or gas would be incompatible with the purpose for which such unit was established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Study of oil and gas potential and impact of development and production; permits; consultations; State studies; reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In such areas as the Secretary deems favorable for the discovery of oil or gas, he shall conduct a study, or studies, or collect and analyze information obtained by permittees authorized to conduct studies under this section, of the oil and gas potential of such lands and those environmental characteristics and wildlife resources which would be affected by the exploration for and development of such oil and gas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary is authorized to issue permits for study, including geological, geophysical, and other assessment activities, if such activities can be conducted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes for which each affected area is managed under applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Energy regarding the national interest involved in exploring for and developing oil and gas from such lands and shall seek the views of the Governor of the State of Alaska, Alaskan local governments, Native Regional and Village Corporations, the Alaska Land Use Council, representatives of the oil and gas industry, conservation groups, and other interested groups and individuals in determining which land should be studied and/or leased for the exploration and development of oil and gas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall encourage the State to undertake similar studies on lands associated, either through geological or other land values or because of possible transportation needs, with Federal lands. The Secretary shall integrate these studies, to the maximum extent practicable, with studies on Federal lands so that needs for cooperation between the Federal Government and the State of Alaska in managing energy and other natural resources, including fish and wildlife, can be established early in the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall report to the Congress by October 1, 1981, and yearly thereafter, on his efforts pursuant to this Act regarding the leasing of, and exploration and development activities on, such lands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 100&ndash;203, title V, &sect;5105(1), Dec. 22, 1987, 101 Stat. 1330&ndash;259</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Issuance of leases; competitive bidding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], the Secretary is authorized to issue leases, on the Federal lands described in this section, under such terms and conditions as he may, by regulation, prescribe.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exploration plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to any exploration activities on a lease issued pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall require the lessee to describe exploration activities in an exploration plan. He shall approve such plan if such activities can be conducted in conformity with such requirements as may be made by the Secretary for the protection and use of the land for the purpose for which it is managed under applicable law.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1704 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Development and production plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsequent to a discovery of oil or gas in paying quantities, and prior to developing and producing such oil and gas, the Secretary shall require the lessee to describe development and production activities in a development and production plan. He shall approve such plan if such activities may be conducted in conformity with such requirements as may be made by the Secretary for the protection and use of the land for the purpose for which it is managed under applicable law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Revised development and production plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall monitor the performance of the lessee and, if he determines that due to significant changes in circumstances regarding that operation, including environmental or economic changes, new requirements are needed, he may require a revised development and production plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Suspension and cancellation of lease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that immediate and irreparable damage will result from continuation in force of a lease, that the threat will not disappear and that the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuation in force of a lease, he shall suspend operations for up to five years. If such a threat persists beyond such five-year suspension period, he shall cancel a lease and provide compensation to the lease under such terms as the Secretary establishes, by regulation, to be appropriate.</p>
