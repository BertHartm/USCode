<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction of temporary roadways in connection with timber contracts, and other permits or leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the necessity for a permanent road is set forth in the forest development road system plan, any road constructed on land of the National Forest System in connection with a timber contract or other permit or lease shall be designed with the goal of reestablishing vegetative cover on the roadway and areas where the vegetative cover has been disturbed by the construction of the road, within ten years after the termination of the contract, permit, or lease either through artificial or natural means. Such action shall be taken unless it is later determined that the road is needed for use as a part of the National Forest Transportation System.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standards of roadway construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Roads constructed on National Forest System lands shall be designed to standards appropriate for the intended uses, considering safety, cost of transportation, and impacts on land and resources.</p>
