<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a producer that implements a land management practice, or develops a comprehensive nutrient management plan, in accordance with this part shall be eligible to receive incentive payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Practices and term</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A contract under this part may apply to 1 or more structural practices, land management practices, and comprehensive nutrient management practices.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Term</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A contract under this part shall have a term that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at a minimum, is equal to the period beginning on the date on which the contract is entered into and ending on the date that is 1 year after the date on which all practices under the contract have been implemented; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed 10 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Bidding down</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that the environmental values of 2 or more applications for cost-share payments or incentive payments are comparable, the Secretary shall not assign a higher priority to the application only because it would present the least cost to the program established under the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cost-share payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the cost-share payments provided to a producer <!-- PDFPage:2104 -->proposing to implement 1 or more practices under the program shall be not more than 75 percent of the cost of the practice, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limited resource and beginning farmers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may increase the amount provided to a producer under paragraph (1) to not more than 90 percent if the producer is a limited resource or beginning farmer or rancher, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cost-share assistance from other sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), any cost-share payments received by a producer from a State or private organization or person for the implementation of 1 or more practices on eligible land of the producer shall be in addition to the payments provided to the producer under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer shall not be eligible for cost-share payments for practices on eligible land under the program if the producer receives cost-share payments or other benefits for the same practice on the same land under part I of this subchapter and the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Incentive payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make incentive payments in an amount and at a rate determined by the Secretary to be necessary to encourage a producer to perform 1 or more land management practices.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount and rate of incentive payments, the Secretary may accord great significance to a practice that promotes residue, nutrient, pest, invasive species, or air quality management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Modification or termination of contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Voluntary modification or termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may modify or terminate a contract entered into with a producer under this part if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the producer agrees to the modification or termination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines that the modification or termination is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Involuntary termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may terminate a contract under this part if the Secretary determines that the producer violated the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Allocation of funding</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Funding for federally recognized Native American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into alternative funding arrangements with federally recognized Native American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations (including their affiliated membership organizations) if the Secretary determines that the goals and objectives of the program will be met by such arrangements, and that statutory limitations regarding contracts with individual producers as defined under this subchapter will not be exceeded by any Tribal or Native Corporation member.</p>
