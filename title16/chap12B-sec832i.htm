<p class="note-body">In subsecs. (a) and (b), &ldquo;chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1949, as amended&rdquo; on authority of Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 631, the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of the second and fourth sentences of subsec. (b) which authorized the Administrator to fix the compensation of laborers, mechanics and workmen without regard to the Classification Act of 1923, and any other laws, rules, or regulations relating to the payment of employees of the United States and which authorized the Administrator, the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Energy to fix the compensation of experts without regard to the Classification Act of 1923, were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this subsection because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). [But see <em>Abell v. United States</em>, 1975, 518 F.2d 1369, cert. denied 429 U.S. 817, and <em>Columbia Power Trades Council v. United States Department of Energy</em>, 1980, 496 F.Supp. 186.] The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Act Sept. 6, 1966, Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;8(a), 80 Stat. 632 (the first section of which revised and enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, into law). Section 5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.</p>
