<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The lands covered by this section include important resources and values, including wildlife habitat, clean water, open space, and opportunities for solitude.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) These lands also include areas that are suitable for recreational uses, including use of snowmobiles in times of adequate snow cover as well as use of other motorized and nonmotorized mechanical devices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) These lands should be managed in a way that affords permanent protection to their resources and values while permitting continued recreational uses in appropriate locales and subject to appropriate regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is to provide for management of certain lands in the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest in a manner consistent with the 1997 Revised Land and Resources Management Plan for this forest in order to protect the natural qualities of these areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The approximately 16,000 acres of land in the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest generally depicted on the map entitled &ldquo;Proposed James Peak Protection Area&rdquo;, dated September 2001, are hereby designated as the James Peak Protection Area (hereafter in this Act referred to as the &ldquo;Protection Area&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Map and boundary description</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after August 21, 2002, the Secretary shall file with the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a map and a boundary description of the Protection Area. The map and boundary description shall have the same force and effect as if included in this Act, except that the Secretary may correct clerical and typographical errors in the map and boundary description. The map and boundary description shall be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Chief of the Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, and in the office of the Forest Supervisor of the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Management</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Protection Area shall be managed and administered by the Secretary in the same manner as the management area prescription designations identified for these lands in the 1997 Revision of the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest and the Pawnee National Grasslands. Such management and administration shall be in accordance with the following:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Grazing</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the operation of the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws, and all amendments thereto.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to affect discretionary authority of the Secretary under other Federal laws to grant, issue, or renew rights-of-way or other land use authorizations consistent with the other provisions of this Act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Motorized and mechanized travel</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Review and inventory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than two years after August 21, 2002, the Secretary, in consultation with interested parties, shall complete a review and inventory of all roads and trails in the Protection Area on which use was allowed on September 10, 2001, except those lands managed under the management prescription referred to in subparagraph (F). During the review and inventory, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) connect existing roads and trails in the inventoried area to other existing roads and trails in the inventoried area for the purpose of mechanized and other nonmotorized use on any lands within the Protection Area as long as there is no net gain in the total mileage of either roads or trails open for public use within the Protection Area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) close or remove roads or trails within the Protection Area that the Secretary determines to be undesirable, except those roads or trails managed pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection or subsection (e)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) After completion of inventory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">After completion of the review and inventory required by clause (i), the Secretary shall ensure that motorized and mechanized travel within the Protection Area shall be permitted only on those roads and trails identified as open to use in the inventory or established pursuant to subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) New roads and trails</h4>

Such maintenance may include vegetation management, road maintenance, ground stabilization, and motorized vehicle access.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Permanent Federal ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All right, title, and interest of the United States, held on or acquired after August 21, 2002, to lands within the boundaries of the Protection Area shall be retained by the United States.</p>
