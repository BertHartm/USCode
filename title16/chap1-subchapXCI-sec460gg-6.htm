<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acquisition without consent of owners; limitations; scenic easements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is further authorized to acquire by purchase with donated or appropriated funds such lands or interests in lands without the consent of the owner only if (1) he deems that all reasonable efforts to acquire such lands or interests therein by negotiation have failed, and (2) the total acreage of all other lands within the recreation area to which he has acquired fee simple title or, lesser interests therein without the consent of the owner is less than 5 per centum of the total acreage which is privately owned within the recreation area on December 31, 1975: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may acquire scenic easements in lands without the consent of the owner and without restriction to such 5 per centum limitation: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary may only acquire scenic easements in lands without the consent of the owner after the date of publication of the regulations required by section 460gg&ndash;7 of this title when he determines that such lands are being used, or are in imminent danger of being used, in a manner incompatible with such regulations.</p>
