<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Statement of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assure the preservation for this and future generations of the outstanding natural <!-- PDFPage:78 -->and scenic features of the area commonly known as the Mineral King Valley and previously designated as the Sequoia National Game Refuge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) enhance the ecological values and public enjoyment of such area by adding such area to the Sequoia National Park.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Drawing copy, availability; boundary revisions: notification of Congressional committees, publication in Federal Register; abolition and transfer of Sequoia National Game Refuge to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to add to the Sequoia National Park (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;park&rdquo;) a certain area known as Mineral King Valley possessing unique natural and scenic values, there is hereby established as part of such park all lands, waters, and interests therein, constituting approximately sixteen thousand two hundred acres designated before November 10, 1978, as the Sequoia National Game Refuge and as depicted on the drawing entitled &ldquo;Boundary Map, Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park&rdquo;, numbered 102&ndash;90,000 and dated April 1975. A copy of such drawing shall be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Director, National Park Service, Department of the Interior. After advising the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate in writing, the Secretary is authorized to make minor revisions of the boundaries of the park when necessary by publication of a revised drawing or other boundary description in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Sequoia National Game Refuge is hereby abolished and the Secretary of Agriculture shall transfer, without consideration, to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary, the area constituting such refuge, and any unexpended funds available for purposes of management of the refuge shall be available for purposes of management of the park.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acquisition of property; place and manner; owner's right of use and occupancy for fixed term of years or life; election of term; fair market value; termination; notification; incompatible commercial uses; unitary parcels; access road, right-of-way, and protective measures; hardship sale offers; limitation of authority; State donated lands; report to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within the boundaries of the area added to the park pursuant to this section, the Secretary may acquire lands and interests in lands by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange, or transfer from other Federal departments or agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Where the private use of any property acquired pursuant to this subsection would, in the judgment of the Secretary, be compatible with the purposes of this section, the Secretary may, as a condition of such acquisition, permit the owner or owners of such property to retain for themselves and their successors or assigns rights of use and occupancy. The owner shall reserve such rights and elect the term to be reserved on the date of acquisition of the property. Except for so much of the property as is donated, the Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of its acquisition, less the fair market value on that date of the right retained by the owner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A right of use and occupancy retained pursuant to paragraph (2) may be terminated by the Secretary upon his determination that the property or any portion thereof is being used in a manner which is incompatible with the purposes of this section. Such right shall terminate by operation of law upon notification by the Secretary to the holder of the right of such determination and tendering to him the amount equal to the fair market value of that portion which remains unexpired as of the date of such tender. In the case of any property which was used for noncommercial purposes during the ten calendar years immediately preceding November 10, 1978, the commercial use of such property subsequent to November 10, 1978, shall be treated as incompatible with the purposes of this section. In the case of any property which was used for commercial purposes at any time during the ten calendar years immediately preceding November 10, 1978, any substantial change or expansion of such commercial use subsequent to November 10, 1978, without the express approval of the Secretary shall be treated as incompatible with such purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In exercising his authority to acquire property under this section, the Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by an individual owning property within the park to sell such property if such individual notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership of such property is causing, or would result in, undue hardship. Nothing in this section, or in any other provision of law, shall prevent the Secretary from exercising his authority to acquire property referred to in this subsection at any time after November 10, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If any individual tract or parcel of land acquired is partly inside and partly outside the boundaries of the park the Secretary may, in order to minimize the payment of severance damages, acquire the whole of the tract or parcel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If the management plan prepared under subsection (e) of this section provides for improved access to the area added to the park under this section, the Secretary is authorized to acquire, by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange or transfer from other Federal departments or agencies, the area comprising the road from State Route 198 to, and within, the Mineral King Valley together with a right-of-way for such road of a width sufficient to include improvements to the road and all bridges, ditches, cuts, and fills appurtenant thereto, but not exceeding a maximum average width of two hundred feet. Property acquired from the State or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired by donation only. With regard to routes of access to and within the Mineral King Valley, the Secretary shall take such measures as are necessary to protect against the effects of siltation on the ecosystem of the park.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall report to the committees of the Congress named in subsection (b)(1) <!-- PDFPage:79 -->of this section the action taken by him pursuant to this subsection. Such report shall contain information sufficient to inform such committees of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the acquisitions made by him pursuant to this subsection during the period covered by such report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) his reasons why all of such property authorized to be acquired and not so acquired as of the date of such report, if any, have not been acquired; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) his schedule of a timetable for the acquisition of such property referred to in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such report shall be submitted before the expiration of the second fiscal year beginning after the date on which the comprehensive management plan is submitted to the committees of Congress pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The area added to the park by this section shall be administered in accordance with this section and the provisions of law generally applicable to units of the National Park System including sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 41, and 43 of this title. Any other statutory authority available to the Secretary for the conservation and management of wildlife, wildlife habitat, and natural resources may be utilized to the extent he finds such authority will further the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except in the case of a lease or permit which the Secretary determines to be incompatible with the administration of the park pursuant to this section, any lease or permit on Federal land within the area added to the park under this section which is in effect immediately before November 10, 1978, shall continue in effect pursuant to its terms and conditions following the expansion of the park under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a lease or permit which is continued under subparagraph (A), upon notice to the Secretary by the lessee or permittee of his intention to seek renewal or extension of such lease or permit, the lease or permit shall be reviewed by the Secretary, and may be renewed or extended for an additional period of five years. Any such lease or permit shall be reviewed at the end of such renewal or extension period and may also be renewed or extended in the same manner for additional five-year periods thereafter. Any renewals or extensions of leases or permits shall be granted only to those persons who were lessees or permittees of record on November 10, 1978, and to their heirs, successors, and assigns, and any such lease or permit shall provide that the lease or permit may be terminated by the Secretary at any time if the Secretary determines that such lease or permit is incompatible with the administration of the park pursuant to this section or that the land is needed for park purposes.</p>

In the preparation of such plan, the Secretary shall give appropriate consideration to the need for the development of additional recreational opportunities and other public uses which are consistent with sound environmental management of the area and the policies of the National Park Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In preparing the comprehensive management plan required by this subsection and in preparing any subsequent revision of such plan, the Secretary shall provide for full public participation and shall consider the comments and views of all interested agencies, organizations, and individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of insuring such full public participation, the Secretary shall provide reasonable advance notice to State and local governments, interested Federal agencies, private organizations, and the general public of hearings, workshops, meetings, and other opportunities available for such participation. Such notice shall be published in newspapers of general circulation in the localities affected by the development and management of the park, published in the Federal Register, and communicated by other appropriate means. The Western Regional Advisory Committee of the National Park Service (or a subcommittee thereof) shall also be utilized for purposes of facilitating public involvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretaries or Directors of all Federal departments, agencies, and commissions having a relevant expertise are hereby authorized and directed to cooperate with the Secretary in his development of such plan and to make such studies as the Secretary may request on a cost reimbursable basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In preparing the comprehensive management plan required by this subsection, the Secretary shall consider technical information and other pertinent data assembled or produced by field studies or investigations conducted separately or jointly by the technical and administrative personnel of the Federal and State agencies involved in order to insure the permanent conservation of wildlife within the area added to the park by this section. Except in emergencies, rules and regulations pertaining to the management of wildlife within the area added to the park by this section shall be put into effect only after consultation with the State of California.</p>
