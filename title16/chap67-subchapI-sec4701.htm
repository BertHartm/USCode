<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the discharge of untreated water in the ballast tanks of vessels and through other means results in unintentional introductions of nonindigenous species to fresh, brackish, and saltwater environments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when environmental conditions are favorable, nonindigenous species, such as the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), become established and may disrupt the aquatic environment and economy of affected coastal areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the zebra mussel was unintentionally introduced into the Great Lakes and, if left uncontrolled, is expected to infest over two-thirds of the continental United States through the unintentional transportation of larvae and adults by vessels operating in inland waters; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the potential economic disruption to communities affected by the zebra mussel due to its colonization of water pipes, boat hulls and other hard surfaces has been estimated at $5,000,000,000 by the year 2000, and the potential disruption to the diversity and abundance of native fish and other species could be severe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to prevent unintentional introduction and dispersal of nonindigenous species into waters of the United States through ballast water management and other requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to coordinate federally conducted, funded or authorized research, prevention&nbsp;<sup><a href="#4701_1_target" name="4701_1">1</a></sup> control, information dissemination and other activities regarding the zebra mussel and other aquatic nuisance species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to develop and carry out environmentally sound control methods to prevent, monitor and control unintentional introductions of nonindigenous species from pathways other than ballast water exchange;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to understand and minimize economic and ecological impacts of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species that become established, including the zebra mussel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish a program of research and technology development and assistance to States in the management and removal of zebra mussels.</p>
