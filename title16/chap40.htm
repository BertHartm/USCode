<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress, in its concern for sustained use of the resource base,<sup><a href="#2001_1_target" name="2001_1">1</a></sup> of the United States, <!-- PDFPage:1620 -->has ensured that the Department of Agriculture possesses information, technical expertise, and a delivery system for providing assistance to land users with respect to conservation and use of soils; plants; woodlands; watershed protection and flood prevention; the conservation, development, utilization, and disposal of water; animal husbandry; fish and wildlife management; recreation; community development; and related resource uses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Resource appraisal is basic to effective soil and water conservation. Since individual and governmental decisions concerning soil and water resources often transcend administrative boundaries and affect other programs and decisions, a coordinated appraisal and program framework are essential.</p>
