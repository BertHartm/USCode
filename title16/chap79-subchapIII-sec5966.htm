<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria for issuance of authorizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority of this section may be used only to authorize provision of services that the Secretary determines will have minimal impact on resources and values of the unit of the National Park System and are consistent with the purpose for which the unit was established and with all applicable management plans and park policies and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Elements of authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require payment of a reasonable fee for issuance of an authorization under this section, such fees to remain available without further appropriation to be used, at a minimum, to recover associated management and administrative costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require that the provision of services under such an authorization be accomplished in a manner consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of park resources and values;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take appropriate steps to limit the liability of the United States arising from the provision of services under such an authorization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) have no authority under this section to issue more authorizations than are consistent with the preservation and proper management of park resources and values, and shall establish such other conditions for issuance of such an authorization as the Secretary determines appropriate for the protection of visitors, provision of adequate and appropriate visitor services, and protection and proper management of the resources and values of the park.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any authorization issued under this section shall be limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) commercial operations with annual gross receipts of not more than $25,000 resulting from services originating and provided solely within a unit of the National Park System pursuant to such authorization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the incidental use of resources of the unit by commercial operations which provide services originating and terminating outside of the boundaries of the unit; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nonprofit institutions are not required to obtain commercial use authorizations unless taxable income is derived by the institution from the authorized use.</p>
