<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Studies on introduction of aquatic nuisance species by vessels</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Ballast exchange study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Task Force shall conduct a study&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to assess the environmental effects of ballast water exchange on the diversity and abundance of native species in receiving estuarine, marine, and fresh waters of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to identify areas within the waters of the United States and the exclusive economic zone, if any, where the exchange of ballast water does not pose a threat of infestation or spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes and other waters of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Biological study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Task Force shall conduct a study to determine whether aquatic nuisance species threaten the ecological characteristics and economic uses of waters of the United States other than the Great Lakes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Shipping study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall conduct a study to determine the need for controls on vessels entering waters of the United States, other than the Great Lakes, to minimize the risk of unintentional introduction and dispersal of aquatic nuisance species in those waters. The study shall include an examination of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the degree to which shipping may be a major pathway of transmission of aquatic nuisance species in those waters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) possible alternatives for controlling introduction of those species through shipping; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the feasibility of implementing regional versus national control measures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Task Force shall cooperate in conducting their respective studies under this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1871 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Ballast exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 18 months after November 29, 1990, and prior to the effective date of the regulations issued under section 4711(b) of this title, the Task Force shall submit a report to the appropriate Committees that presents the results of the study required under subsection (a)(1) of this section and makes recommendations with respect to such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Biological and shipping studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 18 months after November 29, 1990, the Secretary and the Task Force shall each submit to the appropriate Committees a report on the results of their respective studies under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, working through the International Maritime Organization, is encouraged to enter into negotiations with the governments of foreign countries concerning the planning and implementation of measures aimed at the prevention and control of unintentional introductions of aquatic nuisance species in coastal waters.</p>
