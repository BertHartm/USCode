<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Over 12,000 women die each year from ovarian cancer and 44,500 women die from breast cancer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Taxol, a drug made from the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), has been successful in treating ovarian cancer in clinical trials and shows promise in the treatment of breast cancer and other types of cancer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The production of small amounts of taxol currently requires the use of large numbers of Pacific yew.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Pacific yew is a slow-growing tree species found in the Western United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Significant numbers of Pacific yew trees are found in old-growth forests on Federal lands in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1953 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Before the importance of taxol was discovered, the Pacific yew was considered a trash tree and was often burned in slash piles after timber operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Remaining Pacific yew resources must be carefully managed in order to ensure a steady supply of taxol for the treatment of cancer, while also providing for the long-term conservation of the species.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Appropriate management guidelines must be implemented promptly in order to prevent any wasting of the Pacific yew in current and future timber sales on Federal lands, while successful and affordable alternative methods of manufacturing taxol are being developed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are to contribute to the successful treatment of cancer by ensuring that Pacific yew trees located on lands of the National Forest System and on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management are managed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide for the efficient collection and utilization of those parts of the Pacific yew that can be used in the manufacture of taxol for the treatment of cancer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for the sale of Pacific yew from such lands for the commercial production and subsequent sale of taxol at a reasonable cost to cancer patients;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure the long-term conservation of the Pacific yew; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) prevent the wasting of Pacific yew resources while successful and affordable alternative methods of manufacturing taxol are being developed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Secretary concerned&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter, the term &ldquo;Secretary concerned&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to lands and interests in lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to lands and interests in lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Pacific yew policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior shall pursue a conservation and management policy with respect to lands and interests in lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management, which contain the Pacific yew in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide for the sustainable harvest of Pacific yew, or Pacific yew parts, in accordance with relevant land and resource management plans for the manufacture of taxol; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for the long-term conservation of the Pacific yew in the wild.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Content of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The conservation and management policy required by subsection (a) of this section shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in planning harvests of the Pacific yew, priority be given first to areas in which timber has been cut but Pacific yew trees have not been removed, second to areas in which timber is already sold but remains uncut, third to areas scheduled for timber sale in the near future, and fourth to those other areas where commercial and salvage timber sales are allowed under existing laws;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) individual Pacific yew trees are utilized with little or no waste;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent that timber harvesters&rsquo; health and safety will not be jeopardized, the bark is harvested from Pacific yew trees in timber sale areas before the harvest of other timber resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whenever Pacific yew trees are harvested, they are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) cut using methods designed to allow for resprouting from the stump; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) replanted where necessary to maintain the species in the ecosystem; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) timber management and harvest activities are carried out in a manner that will minimize any adverse effects on the survival and regeneration of Pacific yew trees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application of policy to timber harvesting</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary concerned shall ensure that timber sales awarded after August 7, 1992, and timber sales completed before August 7, 1992, but still unharvested on August 7, 1992, are conducted in accordance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the policy expressed in subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the relevant land and resource management plans of the Secretary concerned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consultation under Endangered Species Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary concerned foresees the need to harvest Pacific yew in an area for which an opinion issued under subsection (b)(3)(A) of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536) has concluded that a commercial timber sale is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat identified for the species under that Act [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.], the Secretary concerned shall immediately initiate consultation under that section to determine the effect on endangered and threatened species and critical habitat of harvesting only Pacific yew trees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Inventory of Pacific yew</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 6 months after August 7, 1992, each Secretary concerned shall complete the ongoing inventory of Pacific yew on lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Enforcement and access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary concerned shall ensure the development, implementation, and enforcement of processes for the collection and sale of Pacific yew resources that will minimize the illegal harvest and sale of such resources. The Secretary shall also ensure that access to Pacific yew resources is allowed in a timely manner such that collection of Pacific yew parts can occur before the taxol properties of such parts are degraded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Negotiated sales</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Forest Service sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 472a of this title, the Secretary of Agriculture may negotiate sales of Pacific yew on lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service at not less than appraised value, to parties manufacturing taxol in the United States in accordance with section 355 of title 21 for use in humans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Bureau of Land Management sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the Materials Act of 1947 (30 U.S.C. 601&ndash;604), the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and Act of August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C. 1181a&ndash;1181f), the Secretary of the Interior may negotiate sales of Pacific yew on lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management at not less than appraised value, to parties manufacturing taxol in the United States in accordance with section 355 of title 21 for use in humans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disposition of unutilized material</h4>
