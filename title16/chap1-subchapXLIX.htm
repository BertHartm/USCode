<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) open space near Grand Teton National Park continues to decline;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as the population continues to grow in Teton County, Wyoming, undeveloped land near the Park becomes more scarce;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the loss of open space around Teton Park has negative impacts on wildlife migration routes in the <!-- PDFPage:250 -->area and on visitors to the Park, and its repercussions can be felt throughout the entire region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) a few ranches make up Teton Valley's remaining open space, and the ranches depend on grazing in Grand Teton National Park for summer range to maintain operations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Act that created Grand Teton National Park [act Feb. 26, 1929, ch. 331, 45 Stat. 1314, 16 U.S.C. former 406 to 406d] allowed several permittees to continue livestock grazing in the Park for the life of a designated heir in the family;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) some of the last remaining heirs have died, and as a result the open space around the Park will most likely be subdivided and developed;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) in order to develop the best solution to protect open space immediately adjacent to Grand Teton National Park, the Park Service should conduct a study of open space in the region; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the study should develop workable solutions that are fiscally responsible and acceptable to the National Park Service, the public, local government, and landowners in the area.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a study concerning grazing use and open space in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, and associated use of certain agricultural and ranch lands within and adjacent to the Park, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) base land having appurtenant grazing privileges within Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, remaining after January 1, 1990, under the Act entitled &lsquo;An Act to establish a new Grand Teton National Park in the State of Wyoming, and for other purposes&rsquo;, approved September 14, 1950 (16 U.S.C. 406d&ndash;1 et seq.); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) any ranch and agricultural land adjacent to the Park, the use and disposition of which may affect accomplishment of the purposes of the Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The study shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) assess the significance of the ranching use and pastoral character of the land (including open vistas, wildlife habitat, and other public benefits);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) assess the significance of that use and character to the purposes for which the Park was established and identify any need for preservation of, and practicable means of, preserving the land that is necessary to protect that use and character;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) estimate the costs of implementing any recommendations made for the preservation of the land.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Participation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In conducting the study, the Secretary of the Interior shall seek participation from the Governor of the State of Wyoming, the Teton County Commissioners, the Secretary of Agriculture, affected land owners, and other interested members of the public.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 3 years from the date funding is available for the purposes of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a report to Congress that contains the findings of the study under subsection (a) and makes recommendations to Congress regarding action that may be taken with respect to the land described in subsection (a).</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of the Interior shall reinstate and extend for the duration of the study described in section 2(a) and until such time as the recommendations of the study are implemented, the grazing privileges described in section 2(a)(1), under the same terms and conditions as were in effect prior to the expiration of the privileges.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Change in Land Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, during the period of the study or until such time as the recommendations of the study are implemented, any portion of the land described in section 2(a)(1) is disposed of in a manner that would result in the land no longer being used for ranching or other agricultural purposes, the Secretary of the Interior shall cancel the extension described in subsection (a).&rdquo;</p>
