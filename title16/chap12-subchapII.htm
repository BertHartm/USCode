<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal regulation of transmission and sale of electric energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared that the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest, and that Federal regulation of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter and of that part of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is necessary in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use or sale of electric energy in interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, but except as provided in paragraph (2) shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy or deprive a State or State commission of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line. The Commission shall have jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy, but shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter, over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce, or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy consumed wholly by the transmitter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of sections 824i, 824j, and 824k of this title shall apply to the entities described in such provisions, and such entities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for purposes of carrying out such provisions and for purposes of applying the enforcement authorities of this chapter with respect to such provisions. Compliance with any order of the Commission under the provisions of section 824i or 824j of this title, shall not make an electric utility or other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for any purposes other than the purposes specified in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Electric energy in interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this subchapter, electric energy shall be held to be transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a State and consumed at any point outside thereof; but only insofar as such transmission takes place within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Sale of electric energy at wholesale&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;sale of electric energy at wholesale&rdquo; when used in this subchapter, means a sale of electric energy to any person for resale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Public utility&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; when used in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter means any person who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter (other than facilities subject to such jurisdiction solely by reason of section 824i, 824j, or 824k of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) United States, State, political subdivision of a State, or agency or instrumentality thereof exempt</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision in this subchapter shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a State, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of <!-- PDFPage:1110 -->any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, or employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific reference thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Books and records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon written order of a State commission, a State commission may examine the books, accounts, memoranda, contracts, and records of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an electric utility company subject to its regulatory authority under State law,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any exempt wholesale generator selling energy at wholesale to such electric utility, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any electric utility company, or holding company thereof, which is an associate company or affiliate of an exempt wholesale generator which sells electric energy to an electric utility company referred to in subparagraph (A),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">wherever located, if such examination is required for the effective discharge of the State commission's regulatory responsibilities affecting the provision of electric service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Where a State commission issues an order pursuant to paragraph (1), the State commission shall not publicly disclose trade secrets or sensitive commercial information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any United States district court located in the State in which the State commission referred to in paragraph (1) is located shall have jurisdiction to enforce compliance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) preempt applicable State law concerning the provision of records and other information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any way limit rights to obtain records and other information under Federal law, contracts, or otherwise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection the terms &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo;, &ldquo;associate company&rdquo;, &ldquo;electric utility company&rdquo;, &ldquo;holding company&rdquo;, &ldquo;subsidiary company&rdquo;, and &ldquo;exempt wholesale generator&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as when used in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 [15 U.S.C. 79 et seq.].</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regional districts; establishment; notice to State commissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of assuring an abundant supply of electric energy throughout the United States with the greatest possible economy and with regard to the proper utilization and conservation of natural resources, the Commission is empowered and directed to divide the country into regional districts for the voluntary interconnection and coordination of facilities for the generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy, and it may at any time thereafter, upon its own motion or upon application, make such modifications thereof as in its judgment will promote the public interest. Each such district shall embrace an area which, in the judgment of the Commission, can economically be served by <!-- PDFPage:1111 -->such interconnection and coordinated electric facilities. It shall be the duty of the Commission to promote and encourage such interconnection and coordination within each such district and between such districts. Before establishing any such district and fixing or modifying the boundaries thereof the Commission shall give notice to the State commission of each State situated wholly or in part within such district, and shall afford each such State commission reasonable opportunity to present its views and recommendations, and shall receive and consider such views and recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sale or exchange of energy; establishing physical connections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission, upon application of any State commission or of any person engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy, and after notice to each State commission and public utility affected and after opportunity for hearing, finds such action necessary or appropriate in the public interest it may by order direct a public utility (if the Commission finds that no undue burden will be placed upon such public utility thereby) to establish physical connection of its transmission facilities with the facilities of one or more other persons engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy, to sell energy to or exchange energy with such persons: <em>Provided</em>, That the Commission shall have no authority to compel the enlargement of generating facilities for such purposes, nor to compel such public utility to sell or exchange energy when to do so would impair its ability to render adequate service to its customers. The Commission may prescribe the terms and conditions of the arrangement to be made between the persons affected by any such order, including the apportionment of cost between them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to any of them.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary connection and exchange of facilities during emergency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged, or whenever the Commission determines that an emergency exists by reason of a sudden increase in the demand for electric energy, or a shortage of electric energy or of facilities for the generation or transmission of electric energy, or of fuel or water for generating facilities, or other causes, the Commission shall have authority, either upon its own motion or upon complaint, with or without notice, hearing, or report, to require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest. If the parties affected by such order fail to agree upon the terms of any arrangement between them in carrying out such order, the Commission, after hearing held either before or after such order takes effect, may prescribe by supplemental order such terms as it finds to be just and reasonable, including the compensation or reimbursement which should be paid to or by any such party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Temporary connection during emergency by persons without jurisdiction of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the continuance of any emergency requiring immediate action, any person engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy and not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission may make such temporary connections with any public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or may construct such temporary facilities for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce as may be necessary or appropriate to meet such emergency, and shall not become subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission by reason of such temporary connection or temporary construction: <em>Provided</em>, That such temporary connection shall be discontinued or such temporary construction removed or otherwise disposed of upon the termination of such emergency: <em>Provided further</em>, That upon approval of the Commission permanent connections for emergency use only may be made hereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transmission of electric energy to foreign country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After six months from August 26, 1935, no person shall transmit any electric energy from the United States to a foreign country without first having secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so. The Commission shall issue such order upon application unless, after opportunity for hearing, it finds that the proposed transmission would impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or would impede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commission may by its order grant such application in whole or in part, with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate, and may from time to time, after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown, make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may find necessary or appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transmission or sale at wholesale of electric energy; regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The ownership or operation of facilities for the transmission or sale at wholesale of electric energy which is (a) generated within a State and transmitted from the State across an international boundary and not thereafter transmitted into any other State, or (b) generated in a foreign country and transmitted across an international boundary into a State and not thereafter transmitted into any other State, shall not make a person a public utility subject to regulation as such under other provisions of this subchapter. The State within which any such facilities are located may regulate any such transaction insofar as such State regulation does not conflict with the exercise of the Commission's powers under or relating to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Continuance of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to insure continuity of service to customers of public utilities, the Commission shall require, by rule, each public utility to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) report promptly to the Commission and any appropriate State regulatory authorities <!-- PDFPage:1112 -->any anticipated shortage of electric energy or capacity which would affect such utility's capability of serving its wholesale customers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) submit to the Commission, and to any appropriate State regulatory authority, and periodically revise, contingency plans respecting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shortages of electric energy or capacity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) circumstances which may result in such shortages, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) accommodate any such shortages or circumstances in a manner which shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) give due consideration to the public health, safety, and welfare, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide that all persons served directly or indirectly by such public utility will be treated, without undue prejudice or disadvantage.</p>

The Secretary may accept, and expend, for purposes of such acquisition, amounts from any such person before acquiring a property interest to be transferred to such person under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If no payment is made by a permit holder under paragraph (1), within a reasonable time, the Secretary shall offer such rights-of-way to the original owner for reacquisition at the original price paid by the Secretary.

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any such new schedule is filed the Commission shall have authority, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, at once, and, if it so orders, without answer or formal pleading by the public utility, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, charge, classification, or service; and, pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the Commission, upon filing with such schedules and delivering to the public utility affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, charge, classification, or service, but not for a longer period than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearings, either completed before or after the rate, charge, classification, or service goes into effect, the Commission may make such orders with reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after it had become effective. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made at the expiration of such five months, the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service shall go into effect at the end of such period, but in case of a proposed increased rate or charge, the Commission may by order require the interested public utility or public utilities to keep accurate account in detail of all amounts received by reason of such increase, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts are paid, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may by further order require such public utility or public utilities to refund, with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of such increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found not justified. At any hearing involving a rate or charge sought to be increased, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or charge is just and reasonable shall be upon the public utility, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1121 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Review of automatic adjustment clauses and public utility practices; action by Commission; &ldquo;automatic adjustment clause&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 2 years after November 9, 1978, and not less often than every 4 years thereafter, the Commission shall make a thorough review of automatic adjustment clauses in public utility rate schedules to examine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether or not each such clause effectively provides incentives for efficient use of resources (including economical purchase and use of fuel and electric energy), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether any such clause reflects any costs other than costs which are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) subject to periodic fluctuations and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not susceptible to precise determinations in rate cases prior to the time such costs are incurred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such review may take place in individual rate proceedings or in generic or other separate proceedings applicable to one or more utilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not less frequently than every 2 years, in rate proceedings or in generic or other separate proceedings, the Commission shall review, with respect to each public utility, practices under any automatic adjustment clauses of such utility to insure efficient use of resources (including economical purchase and use of fuel and electric energy) under such clauses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may, on its own motion or upon complaint, after an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing, order a public utility to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) modify the terms and provisions of any automatic adjustment clause, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) cease any practice in connection with the clause,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if such clause or practice does not result in the economical purchase and use of fuel, electric energy, or other items, the cost of which is included in any rate schedule under an automatic adjustment clause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;automatic adjustment clause&rdquo; means a provision of a rate schedule which provides for increases or decreases (or both), without prior hearing, in rates reflecting increases or decreases (or both) in costs incurred by an electric utility. Such term does not include any rate which takes effect subject to refund and subject to a later determination of the appropriate amount of such rate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Unjust or preferential rates, etc.; statement of reasons for changes; hearing; specification of issues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affected such rate, charge, or classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order. Any complaint or motion of the Commission to initiate a proceeding under this section shall state the change or changes to be made in the rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract then in force, and the reasons for any proposed change or changes therein. If, after review of any motion or complaint and answer, the Commission shall decide to hold a hearing, it shall fix by order the time and place of such hearing and shall specify the issues to be adjudicated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Refund effective date; preferential proceedings; statement of reasons for delay; burden of proof; scope of refund order; refund orders in cases of dilatory behavior; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission institutes a proceeding under this section, the Commission shall establish a refund effective date. In the case of a proceeding instituted on complaint, the refund effective date shall not be earlier <!-- PDFPage:1122 -->than the date 60 days after the filing of such complaint nor later than 5 months after the expiration of such 60-day period. In the case of a proceeding instituted by the Commission on its own motion, the refund effective date shall not be earlier than the date 60 days after the publication by the Commission of notice of its intention to initiate such proceeding nor later than 5 months after the expiration of such 60-day period. Upon institution of a proceeding under this section, the Commission shall give to the decision of such proceeding the same preference as provided under section 824d of this title and otherwise act as speedily as possible. If no final decision is rendered by the refund effective date or by the conclusion of the 180-day period commencing upon initiation of a proceeding pursuant to this section, whichever is earlier, the Commission shall state the reasons why it has failed to do so and shall state its best estimate as to when it reasonably expects to make such decision. In any proceeding under this section, the burden of proof to show that any rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential shall be upon the Commission or the complainant. At the conclusion of any proceeding under this section, the Commission may order the public utility to make refunds of any amounts paid, for the period subsequent to the refund effective date through a date fifteen months after such refund effective date, in excess of those which would have been paid under the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract which the Commission orders to be thereafter observed and in force: <em>Provided</em>, That if the proceeding is not concluded within fifteen months after the refund effective date and if the Commission determines at the conclusion of the proceeding that the proceeding was not resolved within the fifteen-month period primarily because of dilatory behavior by the public utility, the Commission may order refunds of any or all amounts paid for the period subsequent to the refund effective date and prior to the conclusion of the proceeding. The refunds shall be made, with interest, to those persons who have paid those rates or charges which are the subject of the proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Refund considerations; shifting costs; reduction in revenues; &ldquo;electric utility companies&rdquo; and &ldquo;registered holding company&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, in a proceeding commenced under this section involving two or more electric utility companies of a registered holding company, refunds which might otherwise be payable under subsection (b) of this section shall not be ordered to the extent that such refunds would result from any portion of a Commission order that (1) requires a decrease in system production or transmission costs to be paid by one or more of such electric companies; and (2) is based upon a determination that the amount of such decrease should be paid through an increase in the costs to be paid by other electric utility companies of such registered holding company: <em>Provided</em>, That refunds, in whole or in part, may be ordered by the Commission if it determines that the registered holding company would not experience any reduction in revenues which results from an inability of an electric utility company of the holding company to recover such increase in costs for the period between the refund effective date and the effective date of the Commission's order. For purposes of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;electric utility companies&rdquo; and &ldquo;registered holding company&rdquo; shall have the same meanings as provided in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended [15 U.S.C. 79 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investigation of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission upon its own motion, or upon the request of any State commission whenever it can do so without prejudice to the efficient and proper conduct of its affairs, may investigate and determine the cost of the production or transmission of electric energy by means of facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission in cases where the Commission has no authority to establish a rate governing the sale of such energy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">An order under section 824j of this title shall require the transmitting utility subject to the order to provide wholesale transmission services at rates, charges, terms, and conditions which permit the recovery by such utility of all the costs incurred in connection with the transmission services and necessary associated services, including, but not limited to, an appropriate share, if any, of legitimate, verifiable and economic costs, including taking into account any benefits to the transmission system of providing the transmission service, and the costs of any enlargement of transmission facilities. Such rates, charges, terms, and conditions shall promote the economically efficient transmission and generation of electricity and shall be just and reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Rates, charges, terms, and conditions for transmission services provided pursuant to an order under section 824j of this title shall ensure that, to the extent practicable, costs incurred in providing the wholesale transmission services, and properly allocable to the provision of such services, are recovered from the applicant for such order and not from a transmitting utility's existing wholesale, retail, and transmission customers.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Issuance of proposed order; agreement by parties to terms and conditions of order; approval by Commission; inclusion in final order; failure to agree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before issuing an order under section 824i of this title or subsection (a) or (b) of section 824j of this title, the Commission shall issue a proposed order and set a reasonable time for parties to the proposed interconnection or transmission order to agree to terms and conditions under which such order is to be carried out, including the apportionment of costs between them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to any of them. Such proposed order shall not be reviewable or enforceable in any court. The time set for such parties to agree to such terms and conditions may be shortened if the Commission determines that delay would jeopardize the attainment of the purposes of any proposed order. Any terms and conditions agreed to by the parties shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the parties agree as provided in paragraph (1) within the time set by the Commission and the Commission approves such agreement, the terms and conditions shall be included in the final order.

<p class="statutory-body">(1) No provision of section 824i, 824j, 824m of this title, or this section shall be treated as requiring any person to utilize the authority of any such section in lieu of any other authority of law. Except as provided in section 824i, 824j, 824m of this title, or this section, such sections shall not be construed as limiting or impairing any authority of the Commission under any other provision of law.</p>

Within 60 days following the issuance by the Commission of any order under section 824i or of section 824j of this title requiring the TVA to enter into any contract for the sale or delivery of power, the Commission may on its own motion initiate, or upon petition of any aggrieved person shall initiate, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not such sale or delivery would result in violation of the third sentence of section 15d(a) of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 (16 U.S.C. 831n&ndash;4), hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the TVA Act [16 U.S.C. 831 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon initiation of any evidentiary hearing under paragraph (1), the Commission shall give notice thereof to any applicant who applied for and obtained the order from the Commission, to any electric utility or other entity subject to such order, and to the public, and shall promptly make the determination referred to in paragraph (1). Upon initiation of such hearing, the Commission shall stay the effectiveness of the order under section 824i or 824j of this title until whichever of the following dates is applicable&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any determination under paragraph (1) shall be reviewable only in the appropriate court of the United States upon petition filed by any aggrieved person or municipality within 60 days <!-- PDFPage:1128 -->after such determination, and such court shall have jurisdiction to grant appropriate relief. Any applicant who applied for and obtained the order under section 824i or 824j of this title, and any electric utility or other entity subject to such order shall have the right to intervene in any such proceeding in such court. Except for review by such court (and any appeal or other review by an appellate court of the United States), no court shall have jurisdiction to consider any action brought by any person to enjoin the carrying out of any order of the Commission under section 824i or section 824j of this title requiring the TVA to take any action on the grounds that such action requires a specific authorization of the Congress pursuant to the third sentence of section 15d(a) of the TVA Act [16 U.S.C. 831n&ndash;4(a)].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall have authority pursuant to section 824i of this title, section 824j of this title, this section, and section 824<em>l</em> of this title to (A) order the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration to provide transmission service and (B) establish the terms and conditions of such service. In applying such sections to the Federal Columbia River Transmission System, the Commission shall assure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the provisions of otherwise applicable Federal laws shall continue in full force and effect and shall continue to be applicable to the system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the rates for the transmission of electric power on the system shall be governed only by such otherwise applicable provisions of law and not by any provision of section 824i of this title, section 824j of this title, this section, or section 824<em>l</em> of this title, except that no rate for the transmission of power on the system shall be unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory or preferential, as determined by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter with respect to the procedures for the determination of terms and conditions for transmission service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration either (i) in response to a written request for specific transmission service terms and conditions does not offer the requested terms and conditions, or (ii) proposes to establish terms and conditions of general applicability for transmission service on the Federal Columbia River Transmission System, then the Administrator may provide opportunity for a hearing and, in so doing, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) give notice in the Federal Register and state in such notice the written explanation of the reasons why the specific terms and conditions for transmission services are not being offered or are being proposed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) adhere to the procedural requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3) of section 839e(i) of this title, except that the hearing officer shall, unless the hearing officer becomes unavailable to the agency, make a recommended decision to the Administrator that states the hearing officer's findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis thereof, on all material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) make a determination, setting forth the reasons for reaching any findings and conclusions which may differ from those of the hearing officer, based on the hearing record, consideration of the hearing officer's recommended decision, section 824j of this title and this section, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the provisions of law as preserved in this section; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if application is made to the Commission under section 824j of this title for transmission service under terms and conditions different than those offered by the Administrator, or following the denial of a request for transmission service by the Administrator, and such application is filed within 60 days of the Administrator's final determination and in accordance with Commission procedures, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the event the Administrator has conducted a hearing as herein provided for (I) accord parties to the Administrator's hear<!-- PDFPage:1129 -->ing the opportunity to offer for the Commission record materials excluded by the Administrator from the hearing record, (II) accord such parties the opportunity to submit for the Commission record comments on appropriate terms and conditions, (III) afford those parties the opportunity for a hearing if and to the extent that the Commission finds the Administrator's hearing record to be inadequate to support a decision by the Commission, and (IV) establish terms and conditions for or deny transmission service based on the Administrator's hearing record, the Commission record, section 824j of this title and this section, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the provisions of law as preserved in this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the event the Administrator has not conducted a hearing as herein provided for, determine whether to issue an order for transmission service in accordance with section 824j of this title and this section, including providing the opportunity for a hearing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding those provisions of section 825<em>l</em>(b) of this title which designate the court in which review may be obtained, any party to a proceeding concerning transmission service sought to be furnished by the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration seeking review of an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding shall obtain a review of such order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Pacific Northwest, as that region is defined by section 839a(14) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the extent the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration cannot be required under section 824j of this title, as a result of the Administrator's other statutory mandates, either to (A) provide transmission service to an applicant which the Commission would otherwise order, or (B) provide such service under rates, terms, and conditions which the Commission would otherwise require, the applicant shall not be required to provide similar transmission services to the Administrator or to provide such services under similar rates, terms, and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission shall not issue any order under section 824i of this title, section 824j of this title, this section, or section 824<em>l</em> of this title requiring the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration to provide transmission service if such an order would impair the Administrator's ability to provide such transmission service to the Administrator's power and transmission customers in the Pacific Northwest, as that region is defined in section 839a(14) of this title, as is needed to assure adequate and reliable service to loads in that region.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Equitability within territory restricted electric systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to an electric utility which is prohibited by Federal law from being a source of power supply, either directly or through a distributor of its electric energy, outside an area set forth in such law, no order issued under section 824j of this title may require such electric utility (or a distributor of such electric utility) to provide transmission services to another entity if the electric energy to be transmitted will be consumed within the area set forth in such Federal law, unless the order is in furtherance of a sale of electric energy to that electric utility: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the foregoing provision shall not apply to any area served at retail by an electric transmission system which was such a distributor on October 24, 1992, and which before October 1, 1991, gave its notice of termination under its power supply contract with such electric utility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) ERCOT utilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any order under section 824j of this title requiring provision of transmission services in whole or in part within ERCOT shall provide that any ERCOT utility which is not a public utility and the transmission facilities of which are actually used for such transmission service is entitled to receive compensation based, insofar as practicable and consistent with subsection (a) of this section, on the transmission ratemaking methodology used by the Public Utility Commission of Texas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
