<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal regulation of transmission and sale of electric energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared that the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest, and that Federal regulation of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter and of that part of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is necessary in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use or sale of electric energy in interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, but except as provided in paragraph (2) shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy or deprive a State or State commission of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line. The Commission shall have jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy, but shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter, over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce, or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy consumed wholly by the transmitter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, the provisions of sections 824b(a)(2), 824e(e), 824i, 824j, 824j&ndash;1, 824k, 824<em>o</em>, 824p, 824q, 824r, 824s, 824t, 824u, and 824v of this title shall apply to the entities described in such provisions, and such entities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for purposes of carrying out such provisions and for purposes of applying the enforcement authorities of this chapter with respect to such provisions. Compliance with any order or rule of the Commission under the provisions of section 824b(a)(2), 824e(e), 824i, 824j, 824j&ndash;1, 824k, 824<em>o</em>, 824p, 824q, 824r, 824s, 824t, 824u, or 824v of this title, shall not make an electric utility or other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for any purposes other than the purposes specified in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Electric energy in interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this subchapter, electric energy shall be held to be transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a State and consumed at any point outside thereof; but only insofar as such transmission takes place within the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1281 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Sale of electric energy at wholesale&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;sale of electric energy at wholesale&rdquo; when used in this subchapter, means a sale of electric energy to any person for resale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Public utility&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; when used in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter means any person who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter (other than facilities subject to such jurisdiction solely by reason of section 824e(e), 824e(f),<sup><a href="#824_1_target" name="824_1">1</a></sup> 824i, 824j, 824j&ndash;1, 824k, 824<em>o</em>, 824p, 824q, 824r, 824s, 824t, 824u, or 824v of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) United States, State, political subdivision of a State, or agency or instrumentality thereof exempt</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision in this subchapter shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a State, an electric cooperative that receives financing under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) or that sells less than 4,000,000 megawatt hours of electricity per year, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, or employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific reference thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Books and records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon written order of a State commission, a State commission may examine the books, accounts, memoranda, contracts, and records of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Where a State commission issues an order pursuant to paragraph (1), the State commission shall not publicly disclose trade secrets or sensitive commercial information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any United States district court located in the State in which the State commission referred to in paragraph (1) is located shall have jurisdiction to enforce compliance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) preempt applicable State law concerning the provision of records and other information; or</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;824a. Interconnection and coordination of facilities; emergencies; transmission to foreign countries</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regional districts; establishment; notice to State commissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of assuring an abundant supply of electric energy throughout the United States with the greatest possible economy and with regard to the proper utilization and conservation of natural resources, the Commission is empowered and directed to divide the country into regional districts for the voluntary interconnection and coordination of facilities for the generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy, and it may at any time thereafter, upon its own motion or upon application, make such modifications thereof as in its judgment will promote the public interest. Each such district shall embrace an area which, in the judgment of the Commission, can economically be served by such interconnection and coordinated electric facilities. It shall be the duty of the Commission to promote and encourage such interconnection and coordination within each such district and between such districts. Before establishing any such district and fixing or modifying the boundaries thereof the Commission shall give notice to the State commission of each State situated wholly or in part within such district, and shall afford each such State commission reasonable opportunity to present its views and recommendations, and shall receive and consider such views and recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sale or exchange of energy; establishing physical connections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission, upon application of any State commission or of any person engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy, and after notice to each State commission and public utility affected and after opportunity for hearing, finds such action necessary or appropriate in the public interest it may by order direct a public utility (if the Commission finds that no undue burden will be placed upon such public utility thereby) to establish physical connection of its transmission facilities with the facilities of one or more other persons engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy, to sell energy to or exchange energy with such persons: <em>Provided</em>, That the Commission shall have no authority to compel the enlargement of generating facilities for such purposes, nor to compel such public utility to sell or exchange energy when to do so would impair its ability to render adequate service to its customers. The Commission may prescribe the terms and conditions of the arrangement to be made between the persons affected by any such order, including the apportionment of cost between them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to any of them.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary connection and exchange of facilities during emergency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged, or whenever the Commission determines that an emergency exists by reason of a sudden increase in the demand for electric energy, or a shortage of electric energy or of facilities for the generation or transmission of electric energy, or of fuel or water for generating facilities, or other causes, the Commission shall have authority, either upon its own motion or upon complaint, with or without notice, hearing, or report, to require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest. If the parties affected by such order fail to agree upon the terms of any arrangement between them in carrying out such order, the Commission, after hearing held either before or after such order takes effect, may prescribe by supplemental order such terms as it finds to be just and reasonable, including the compensation or reimbursement which should be paid to or by any such party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Temporary connection during emergency by persons without jurisdiction of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the continuance of any emergency requiring immediate action, any person engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy and not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission may make such temporary connections with any public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or may construct such temporary facilities for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce as may be necessary or appropriate to meet such emergency, and shall not become subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission by reason of such temporary connection or temporary construction: <em>Provided</em>, That such temporary connection shall be discontinued or such temporary construction removed or otherwise disposed of upon the termination of such emergency: <em>Provided further</em>, That upon approval of the Commission permanent connections for emergency use only may be made hereunder.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1283 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transmission of electric energy to foreign country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After six months from August 26, 1935, no person shall transmit any electric energy from the United States to a foreign country without first having secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so. The Commission shall issue such order upon application unless, after opportunity for hearing, it finds that the proposed transmission would impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or would impede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commission may by its order grant such application in whole or in part, with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate, and may from time to time, after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown, make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may find necessary or appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transmission or sale at wholesale of electric energy; regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The ownership or operation of facilities for the transmission or sale at wholesale of electric energy which is (a) generated within a State and transmitted from the State across an international boundary and not thereafter transmitted into any other State, or (b) generated in a foreign country and transmitted across an international boundary into a State and not thereafter transmitted into any other State, shall not make a person a public utility subject to regulation as such under other provisions of this subchapter. The State within which any such facilities are located may regulate any such transaction insofar as such State regulation does not conflict with the exercise of the Commission's powers under or relating to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Continuance of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to insure continuity of service to customers of public utilities, the Commission shall require, by rule, each public utility to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) report promptly to the Commission and any appropriate State regulatory authorities any anticipated shortage of electric energy or capacity which would affect such utility's capability of serving its wholesale customers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) submit to the Commission, and to any appropriate State regulatory authority, and periodically revise, contingency plans respecting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shortages of electric energy or capacity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) circumstances which may result in such shortages, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) accommodate any such shortages or circumstances in a manner which shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) give due consideration to the public health, safety, and welfare, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide that all persons served directly or indirectly by such public utility will be treated, without undue prejudice or disadvantage.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Subsection (j) shall not apply to the project if the application for license or exemption for the project was filed, and accepted for filing by the Commission, before the enactment of this Act [Oct. 16, 1986].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Paragraphs (1) and (3) of such subsection (j) shall not apply if the application for the license or exemption for the project was filed before the enactment of this Act [Oct. 16, 1986] and accepted for filing by the Commission (in accordance with the Commission's regulations and procedures in effect on January 1, 1986, including those relating to the requirement for environmental consultation) within 3 years after such enactment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(4)(A) Paragraph (3) of subsection (j) shall not apply for projects where the license or exemption application was filed after enactment of this Act [Oct. 16, 1986] if, based on a petition filed by the applicant for such project within 18 months after such enactment, the Commission determines (after public notice and opportunity for public comment of at least 45 days) that the applicant has demonstrated that he had committed (prior to the enactment of this Act) substantial monetary resources directly related to the development of the project and to the diligent and timely completion of all requirements of the Commission for filing an acceptable application for license or exemption. Such petition shall be publicly available and shall be filed in such form as the Commission shall require by rule issued within 120 days after the enactment of this Act. The public notice required under this subparagraph shall include written notice by the petitioner to affected Federal and State agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) In the case of any petition referred to in subparagraph (A), if the applicant had a preliminary permit and had completed environmental consultations (required by Commission regulations and procedures in effect on January 1, 1986) prior to enactment, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such applicant had committed substantial monetary resources prior to enactment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(C) The applicant for a license or exemption for a project described in subparagraph (A) may petition the Commission for an initial determination under paragraph (1) of section 210(j) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 [16 U.S.C. 824a&ndash;3(j)(1)] prior to the time the license or exemption is issued. If the Commission initially finds that the project will have substantial adverse effects on the environment within the meaning of such paragraph (1), prior to making a final finding under that paragraph the Commission shall afford the applicant a reasonable opportunity to provide for mitigation of such adverse effects. The Commission shall make a final finding under such paragraph (1) at the time the license or exemption is issued. If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has notified the State of its initial finding and the State has not taken any action described in paragraph (2) of section 210(j) before such final finding, the failure to take such action shall be the basis for a rebuttable presumption that there is not a substantial adverse effect on the environment related to natural, recreational, cultural, or scenic attributes for purposes of such finding.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(D) If a petition under subparagraph (A) is denied, all provisions of section 210(j) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 [16 U.S.C. 824a&ndash;3(j)] shall apply to the project regardless of when the license or exemption is issued.&rdquo;</p>

The Commission shall provide expedited review for such transactions. The Commission shall grant or deny any other application for approval of a transaction not later than 180 days after the application is filed.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No public utility shall issue any security, or assume any obligation or liability as guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person, unless and until, and then only to the extent that, upon application by the public utility, the Commission by order authorizes such issue or assumption of liability. The Commission shall make such order only if it finds that such issue or assumption (a) is for some lawful object, within the corporate purposes of the applicant and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the applicant of service as a public utility and which will not impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes. The provisions of this section shall be effective six months after August 26, 1935.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application approval or modification; supplemental orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, after opportunity for hearing, may grant any application under this section in whole or in part, and with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as it may find necessary or appropriate, and may from time to time, after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown, make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may find necessary or appropriate, and may by any such supplemental order modify the provisions of any previous order as to the particular purposes, uses, and extent to which, or the conditions under which, any security so theretofore authorized or the proceeds thereof may be applied, subject always to the requirements of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compliance with order of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No public utility shall, without the consent of the Commission, apply any security or any proceeds thereof to any purpose not specified in the Commission's order, or supplemental order, or to any purpose in excess of the amount allowed for such purpose in such order, or otherwise in contravention of such order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of capitalization not to exceed amount paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall not authorize the capitalization of the right to be a corporation or of any franchise, permit, or contract for consolidation, merger, or lease in excess of the amount (exclusive of any tax or annual charge) actually paid as the consideration for such right, franchise, permit, or contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to the issue or renewal of, or assumption of li<!-- PDFPage:1293 -->ability on, a note or draft maturing not more than one year after the date of such issue, renewal, or assumption of liability, and aggregating (together with all other then outstanding notes and drafts of a maturity of one year or less on which such public utility is primarily or secondarily liable) not more than 5 per centum of the par value of the other securities of the public utility then outstanding. In the case of securities having no par value, the par value for the purpose of this subsection shall be the fair market value as of the date of issue. Within ten days after any such issue, renewal, or assumption of liability, the public utility shall file with the Commission a certificate of notification, in such form as may be prescribed by the Commission, setting forth such matters as the Commission shall by regulation require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Public utility securities regulated by State not affected</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Just and reasonable rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preference or advantage unlawful</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No public utility shall, with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, (1) make or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage, or (2) maintain any unreasonable difference in rates, charges, service, facilities, or in any other respect, either as between localities or as between classes of service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Schedules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, every public utility shall file with the Commission, within such time and in such form as the Commission may designate, and shall keep open in convenient form and place for public inspection schedules showing all rates and charges for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such rates and charges, together with all contracts which in any manner affect or relate to such rates, charges, classifications, and services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice required for rate changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the Commission otherwise orders, no change shall be made by any public utility in any such rate, charge, classification, or service, or in any rule, regulation, or contract relating thereto, except after sixty days&rsquo; notice to the Commission and to the public. Such notice shall be given by filing with the Commission and keeping open for public inspection new schedules stating plainly the change or changes to be made in the schedule or schedules then in force and the time when the change or changes will go into effect. The Commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect without requiring the sixty days&rsquo; notice herein provided for by an order specifying the changes so to be made and the time when they shall take effect and the manner in which they shall be filed and published.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Suspension of new rates; hearings; five-month period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any such new schedule is filed the Commission shall have authority, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, at once, and, if it so orders, without answer or formal pleading by the public utility, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, charge, classification, or service; and, pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the Commission, upon filing with such schedules and delivering to the public utility affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, charge, classification, or service, but not for a longer period than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearings, either completed before or after the rate, charge, classification, or service goes into effect, the Commission may make such orders with reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after it had become effective. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made at the expiration of such five months, the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service shall go into effect at the end of such period, but in case of a proposed <!-- PDFPage:1294 -->increased rate or charge, the Commission may by order require the interested public utility or public utilities to keep accurate account in detail of all amounts received by reason of such increase, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts are paid, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may by further order require such public utility or public utilities to refund, with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of such increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found not justified. At any hearing involving a rate or charge sought to be increased, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or charge is just and reasonable shall be upon the public utility, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Review of automatic adjustment clauses and public utility practices; action by Commission; &ldquo;automatic adjustment clause&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 2 years after November 9, 1978, and not less often than every 4 years thereafter, the Commission shall make a thorough review of automatic adjustment clauses in public utility rate schedules to examine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether or not each such clause effectively provides incentives for efficient use of resources (including economical purchase and use of fuel and electric energy), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether any such clause reflects any costs other than costs which are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) subject to periodic fluctuations and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not susceptible to precise determinations in rate cases prior to the time such costs are incurred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such review may take place in individual rate proceedings or in generic or other separate proceedings applicable to one or more utilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not less frequently than every 2 years, in rate proceedings or in generic or other separate proceedings, the Commission shall review, with respect to each public utility, practices under any automatic adjustment clauses of such utility to insure efficient use of resources (including economical purchase and use of fuel and electric energy) under such clauses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may, on its own motion or upon complaint, after an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing, order a public utility to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) modify the terms and provisions of any automatic adjustment clause, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) cease any practice in connection with the clause,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if such clause or practice does not result in the economical purchase and use of fuel, electric energy, or other items, the cost of which is included in any rate schedule under an automatic adjustment clause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;automatic adjustment clause&rdquo; means a provision of a rate schedule which provides for increases or decreases (or both), without prior hearing, in rates reflecting increases or decreases (or both) in costs incurred by an electric utility. Such term does not include any rate which takes effect subject to refund and subject to a later determination of the appropriate amount of such rate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Unjust or preferential rates, etc.; statement of reasons for changes; hearing; specification of issues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission, after a hearing held upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting such rate, charge, or classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order. Any complaint or motion of the Commission to initiate a proceeding under this section shall state the change or changes to be made in the rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract then in force, and the reasons for any proposed change or changes therein. If, after review of any motion or complaint and answer, the Commission shall decide to hold a hearing, it shall fix by order the time and place of such hearing and shall specify the issues to be adjudicated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Refund effective date; preferential proceedings; statement of reasons for delay; burden of proof; scope of refund order; refund orders in cases of dilatory behavior; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission institutes a proceeding under this section, the Commission shall establish a refund effective date. In the <!-- PDFPage:1295 -->case of a proceeding instituted on complaint, the refund effective date shall not be earlier than the date of the filing of such complaint nor later than 5 months after the filing of such complaint. In the case of a proceeding instituted by the Commission on its own motion, the refund effective date shall not be earlier than the date of the publication by the Commission of notice of its intention to initiate such proceeding nor later than 5 months after the publication date. Upon institution of a proceeding under this section, the Commission shall give to the decision of such proceeding the same preference as provided under section 824d of this title and otherwise act as speedily as possible. If no final decision is rendered by the conclusion of the 180-day period commencing upon initiation of a proceeding pursuant to this section, the Commission shall state the reasons why it has failed to do so and shall state its best estimate as to when it reasonably expects to make such decision. In any proceeding under this section, the burden of proof to show that any rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential shall be upon the Commission or the complainant. At the conclusion of any proceeding under this section, the Commission may order refunds of any amounts paid, for the period subsequent to the refund effective date through a date fifteen months after such refund effective date, in excess of those which would have been paid under the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract which the Commission orders to be thereafter observed and in force: <em>Provided</em>, That if the proceeding is not concluded within fifteen months after the refund effective date and if the Commission determines at the conclusion of the proceeding that the proceeding was not resolved within the fifteen-month period primarily because of dilatory behavior by the public utility, the Commission may order refunds of any or all amounts paid for the period subsequent to the refund effective date and prior to the conclusion of the proceeding. The refunds shall be made, with interest, to those persons who have paid those rates or charges which are the subject of the proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Refund considerations; shifting costs; reduction in revenues; &ldquo;electric utility companies&rdquo; and &ldquo;registered holding company&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, in a proceeding commenced under this section involving two or more electric utility companies of a registered holding company, refunds which might otherwise be payable under subsection (b) of this section shall not be ordered to the extent that such refunds would result from any portion of a Commission order that (1) requires a decrease in system production or transmission costs to be paid by one or more of such electric companies; and (2) is based upon a determination that the amount of such decrease should be paid through an increase in the costs to be paid by other electric utility companies of such registered holding company: <em>Provided</em>, That refunds, in whole or in part, may be ordered by the Commission if it determines that the registered holding company would not experience any reduction in revenues which results from an inability of an electric utility company of the holding company to recover such increase in costs for the period between the refund effective date and the effective date of the Commission's order. For purposes of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;electric utility companies&rdquo; and &ldquo;registered holding company&rdquo; shall have the same meanings as provided in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.<sup><a href="#824e_1_target" name="824e_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investigation of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission upon its own motion, or upon the request of any State commission whenever it can do so without prejudice to the efficient and proper conduct of its affairs, may investigate and determine the cost of the production or transmission of electric energy by means of facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission in cases where the Commission has no authority to establish a rate governing the sale of such energy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Short-term sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;short-term sale&rdquo; means an agreement for the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce that is for a period of 31 days or less (excluding monthly contracts subject to automatic renewal).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;applicable Commission rule&rdquo; means a Commission rule applicable to sales at wholesale by public utilities that the Commission determines after notice and comment should also be applicable to entities subject to this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an entity described in section 824(f) of this title voluntarily makes a short-term sale of electric energy through an organized market in which the rates for the sale are established by Commission-approved tariff (rather than by contract) and the sale violates the terms of the tariff or applicable Commission rules in effect at the time of the sale, the entity shall be subject to the refund authority of the Commission under this section with respect to the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any entity that sells in total (including affiliates of the entity) less than 8,000,000 megawatt hours of electricity per year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an electric cooperative.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Commission shall have refund authority under paragraph (2) with respect to a voluntary short term sale of electric energy by the Bonneville Power Administration only if the sale is at an unjust and unreasonable rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission may order a refund under subparagraph (A) only for short-term sales made by the Bonneville Power Administration at rates that are higher than the highest just and reasonable rate charged by any other entity for a short-term sale of electric energy in the same geographic market for the same, or most nearly comparable, period as the sale by the Bonneville Power Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of any Federal power marketing agency or the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Commission shall not assert or exercise any regulatory authority or power under paragraph <!-- PDFPage:1296 -->(2) other than the ordering of refunds to achieve a just and reasonable rate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;824j&ndash;1. Open access by unregulated transmitting utilities</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definition of unregulated transmitting utility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;unregulated transmitting utility&rdquo; means an entity that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) owns or operates facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is an entity described in section 824(f) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transmission operation services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 824k(h) of this title, the Commission may, by rule or order, require an <!-- PDFPage:1300 -->unregulated transmitting utility to provide transmission services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at rates that are comparable to those that the unregulated transmitting utility charges itself; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) on terms and conditions (not relating to rates) that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself and that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall exempt from any rule or order under this section any unregulated transmitting utility that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sells not more than 4,000,000 megawatt hours of electricity per year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) does not own or operate any transmission facilities that are necessary for operating an interconnected transmission system (or any portion of the system); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) meets other criteria the Commission determines to be in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Local distribution facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to facilities used in local distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exemption termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission, after an evidentiary hearing held on a complaint and after giving consideration to reliability standards established under section 824<em>o</em> of this title, finds on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence that any exemption granted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section unreasonably impairs the continued reliability of an interconnected transmission system, the Commission shall revoke the exemption granted to the transmitting utility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Application to unregulated transmitting utilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rate changing procedures applicable to public utilities under subsections (c) and (d) of section 824d of this title are applicable to unregulated transmitting utilities for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Remand</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In exercising authority under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Commission may remand transmission rates to an unregulated transmitting utility for review and revision if necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Other requests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provision of transmission services under subsection (b) of this section does not preclude a request for transmission services under section 824j of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may not require a State or municipality to take action under this section that would violate a private activity bond rule for purposes of section 141 of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Transfer of control of transmitting facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section authorizes the Commission to require an unregulated transmitting utility to transfer control or operational control of its transmitting facilities to a Transmission Organization that is designated to provide nondiscriminatory transmission access.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rates, charges, terms, and conditions for wholesale transmission services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order under section 824j of this title shall require the transmitting utility subject to the order to provide wholesale transmission services at rates, charges, terms, and conditions which permit the recovery by such utility of all the costs incurred in connection with the transmission services and necessary associated services, including, but not limited to, an appropriate share, if any, of legitimate, verifiable and economic costs, including taking into account any benefits to the transmission system of providing the transmission service, and the costs of any enlargement of transmission facilities. Such rates, charges, terms, and conditions shall promote the economically efficient transmission and generation of electricity and shall be just and reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Rates, charges, terms, and conditions for transmission services provided pursuant to an order under section 824j of this title shall ensure that, to the extent practicable, costs incurred in providing the wholesale transmission services, and properly allocable to the provision of such services, are recovered from the applicant for such order and not from a transmitting utility's existing wholesale, retail, and transmission customers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Repealed. Pub. L. 102&ndash;486, title VII, &sect;722(1), Oct. 24, 1992, 106 Stat. 2916</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Issuance of proposed order; agreement by parties to terms and conditions of order; approval by Commission; inclusion in final order; failure to agree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before issuing an order under section 824i of this title or subsection (a) or (b) of section 824j of this title, the Commission shall issue a proposed order and set a reasonable time for parties to the proposed interconnection or transmission order to agree to terms and conditions under which such order is to be carried out, including the apportionment of costs between them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to any of them. Such proposed order shall not be reviewable or enforceable in any court. The time set for such parties to agree to such terms and conditions may be shortened if the Commission determines that delay would jeopardize the attainment of the purposes of any proposed order. Any terms and conditions agreed to by the parties shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the parties agree as provided in paragraph (1) within the time set by the Commission and the Commission approves such agreement, the terms and conditions shall be included in the final order. In the case of an order under section 824i of this title, if the parties fail to agree <!-- PDFPage:1301 -->within the time set by the Commission or if the Commission does not approve any such agreement, the Commission shall prescribe such terms and conditions and include such terms and conditions in the final order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of any order applied for under section 824j of this title, if the parties fail to agree within the time set by the Commission, the Commission shall prescribe such terms and conditions in the final order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Statement of reasons for denial</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission does not issue any order applied for under section 824i or 824j of this title, the Commission shall, by order, deny such application and state the reasons for such denial.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Savings provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No provision of section 824i, 824j, 824m of this title, or this section shall be treated as requiring any person to utilize the authority of any such section in lieu of any other authority of law. Except as provided in section 824i, 824j, 824m of this title, or this section, such sections shall not be construed as limiting or impairing any authority of the Commission under any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Sections 824i, 824j, 824<em>l</em>, 824m of this title, and this section, shall not be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the antitrust laws. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;antitrust laws&rdquo; has the meaning given in subsection (a) of the first sentence of section 12 of title 15, except that such term includes section 45 of title 15 to the extent that such section relates to unfair methods of competition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effective date of order; hearing; notice; review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No order under section 824i or 824j of this title requiring the Tennessee Valley Authority (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;TVA&rdquo;) to take any action shall take effect for 60 days following the date of issuance of the order. Within 60 days following the issuance by the Commission of any order under section 824i or of section 824j of this title requiring the TVA to enter into any contract for the sale or delivery of power, the Commission may on its own motion initiate, or upon petition of any aggrieved person shall initiate, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not such sale or delivery would result in violation of the third sentence of section 15d(a) of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 (16 U.S.C. 831n&ndash;4), hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the TVA Act [16 U.S.C. 831 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon initiation of any evidentiary hearing under paragraph (1), the Commission shall give notice thereof to any applicant who applied for and obtained the order from the Commission, to any electric utility or other entity subject to such order, and to the public, and shall promptly make the determination referred to in paragraph (1). Upon initiation of such hearing, the Commission shall stay the effectiveness of the order under section 824i or 824j of this title until whichever of the following dates is applicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which there is a final determination (including any judicial review thereof under paragraph (3)) that no such violation would result from such order, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which a specific authorization of the Congress (within the meaning of the third sentence of section 15d(a) of the TVA Act [16 U.S.C. 831n&ndash;4(a)]) takes effect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any determination under paragraph (1) shall be reviewable only in the appropriate court of the United States upon petition filed by any aggrieved person or municipality within 60 days after such determination, and such court shall have jurisdiction to grant appropriate relief. Any applicant who applied for and obtained the order under section 824i or 824j of this title, and any electric utility or other entity subject to such order shall have the right to intervene in any such proceeding in such court. Except for review by such court (and any appeal or other review by an appellate court of the United States), no court shall have jurisdiction to consider any action brought by any person to enjoin the carrying out of any order of the Commission under section 824i or section 824j of this title requiring the TVA to take any action on the grounds that such action requires a specific authorization of the Congress pursuant to the third sentence of section 15d(a) of the TVA Act [16 U.S.C. 831n&ndash;4(a)].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prohibition on orders inconsistent with retail marketing areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No order may be issued under this chapter which is inconsistent with any State law which governs the retail marketing areas of electric utilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prohibition on mandatory retail wheeling and sham wholesale transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No order issued under this chapter shall be conditioned upon or require the transmission of electric energy:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) directly to an ultimate consumer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to, or for the benefit of, an entity if such electric energy would be sold by such entity directly to an ultimate consumer, unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such entity is a Federal power marketing agency; the Tennessee Valley Authority; a State or any political subdivision of a State (or an agency, authority, or instrumentality of a State or a political subdivision); a corporation or association that has ever received a loan for the purposes of providing electric service from the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 [7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.]; a person having an obligation arising under State or local law (exclusive of an obligation arising solely from a contract entered into by such person) to provide electric service to the public; or any corporation or association which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such entity was providing electric service to such ultimate consumer on October 24, 1992, or would utilize transmission or distribution facilities that it owns or controls to deliver all such electric energy to such electric consumer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this subsection shall affect any authority of any State or local government under State law concerning the transmission of electric energy directly to an ultimate consumer.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1302 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Laws applicable to Federal Columbia River Transmission System</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall have authority pursuant to section 824i of this title, section 824j of this title, this section, and section 824<em>l</em> of this title to (A) order the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration to provide transmission service and (B) establish the terms and conditions of such service. In applying such sections to the Federal Columbia River Transmission System, the Commission shall assure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the provisions of otherwise applicable Federal laws shall continue in full force and effect and shall continue to be applicable to the system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the rates for the transmission of electric power on the system shall be governed only by such otherwise applicable provisions of law and not by any provision of section 824i of this title, section 824j of this title, this section, or section 824<em>l</em> of this title, except that no rate for the transmission of power on the system shall be unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory or preferential, as determined by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter with respect to the procedures for the determination of terms and conditions for transmission service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration either (i) in response to a written request for specific transmission service terms and conditions does not offer the requested terms and conditions, or (ii) proposes to establish terms and conditions of general applicability for transmission service on the Federal Columbia River Transmission System, then the Administrator may provide opportunity for a hearing and, in so doing, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) give notice in the Federal Register and state in such notice the written explanation of the reasons why the specific terms and conditions for transmission services are not being offered or are being proposed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) adhere to the procedural requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3) of section 839e(i) of this title, except that the hearing officer shall, unless the hearing officer becomes unavailable to the agency, make a recommended decision to the Administrator that states the hearing officer's findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis thereof, on all material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) make a determination, setting forth the reasons for reaching any findings and conclusions which may differ from those of the hearing officer, based on the hearing record, consideration of the hearing officer's recommended decision, section 824j of this title and this section, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the provisions of law as preserved in this section; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if application is made to the Commission under section 824j of this title for transmission service under terms and conditions different than those offered by the Administrator, or following the denial of a request for transmission service by the Administrator, and such application is filed within 60 days of the Administrator's final determination and in accordance with Commission procedures, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the event the Administrator has conducted a hearing as herein provided for (I) accord parties to the Administrator's hearing the opportunity to offer for the Commission record materials excluded by the Administrator from the hearing record, (II) accord such parties the opportunity to submit for the Commission record comments on appropriate terms and conditions, (III) afford those parties the opportunity for a hearing if and to the extent that the Commission finds the Administrator's hearing record to be inadequate to support a decision by the Commission, and (IV) establish terms and conditions for or deny transmission service based on the Administrator's hearing record, the Commission record, section 824j of this title and this section, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the provisions of law as preserved in this section, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding those provisions of section 825<em>l</em>(b) of this title which designate the court in which review may be obtained, any party to a proceeding concerning transmission service sought to be furnished by the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration seeking review of an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding shall obtain a review of such order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Pacific Northwest, as that region is defined by section 839a(14) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the extent the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration cannot be required under section 824j of this title, as a result of the Administrator's other statutory mandates, either to (A) provide transmission service to an applicant which the Commission would otherwise order, or (B) provide such service under rates, terms, and conditions which the Commission would otherwise require, the applicant shall not be required to provide similar transmission services to the Administrator or to provide such services under similar rates, terms, and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission shall not issue any order under section 824i of this title, section 824j of this title, this section, or section 824<em>l</em> of this title requiring the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration to provide transmission service if such an order would impair the Administrator's ability to provide such transmission service to the Administrator's power and transmission customers in the Pacific Northwest, as that region is defined in section 839a(14) of this title, as is needed to assure adequate and reliable service to loads in that region.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1303 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Equitability within territory restricted electric systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to an electric utility which is prohibited by Federal law from being a source of power supply, either directly or through a distributor of its electric energy, outside an area set forth in such law, no order issued under section 824j of this title may require such electric utility (or a distributor of such electric utility) to provide transmission services to another entity if the electric energy to be transmitted will be consumed within the area set forth in such Federal law, unless the order is in furtherance of a sale of electric energy to that electric utility: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the foregoing provision shall not apply to any area served at retail by an electric transmission system which was such a distributor on October 24, 1992, and which before October 1, 1991, gave its notice of termination under its power supply contract with such electric utility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The term &ldquo;cybersecurity incident&rdquo; means a malicious act or suspicious event that disrupts, or was an attempt to disrupt, the operation of those programmable electronic devices and communication networks including hardware, software and data that are essential to the reliable operation of the bulk power system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Jurisdiction and applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall have jurisdiction, within the United States, over the ERO certified by the Commission under subsection (c) of this section, any regional entities, and all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system, including but not limited to the entities described in section 824(f) of this title, for purposes of approving reliability standards established under this section and enforcing compliance with this section. All users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system shall comply with reliability standards that take effect under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall issue a final rule to implement the requirements of this section not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Following the issuance of a Commission rule under subsection (b)(2) of this section, any person may submit an application to the Commission for certification as the Electric Reliability Organization. The Commission may certify one such ERO if the Commission determines that such ERO&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has the ability to develop and enforce, subject to subsection (e)(2) of this section, re<!-- PDFPage:1305 -->liability standards that provide for an adequate level of reliability of the bulk-power system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has established rules that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assure its independence of the users and owners and operators of the bulk-power system, while assuring fair stakeholder representation in the selection of its directors and balanced decisionmaking in any ERO committee or subordinate organizational structure;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) provide for taking, after certification, appropriate steps to gain recognition in Canada and Mexico.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reliability standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Electric Reliability Organization shall file each reliability standard or modification to a reliability standard that it proposes to be made effective under this section with the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may approve, by rule or order, a proposed reliability standard or modification to a reliability standard if it determines that the standard is just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest. The Commission shall give due weight to the technical expertise of the Electric Reliability Organization with respect to the content of a proposed standard or modification to a reliability standard and to the technical expertise of a regional entity organized on an Interconnection-wide basis with respect to a reliability standard to be applicable within that Interconnection, but shall not defer with respect to the effect of a standard on competition. A proposed standard or modification shall take effect upon approval by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Electric Reliability Organization shall rebuttably presume that a proposal from a regional entity organized on an Interconnection-wide basis for a reliability standard or modification to a reliability standard to be applicable on an Interconnection-wide basis is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall remand to the Electric Reliability Organization for further consideration a proposed reliability standard or a modification to a reliability standard that the Commission disapproves in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission, upon its own motion or upon complaint, may order the Electric Reliability Organization to submit to the Commission a proposed reliability standard or a modification to a reliability standard that addresses a specific matter if the Commission considers such a new or modified reliability standard appropriate to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The final rule adopted under subsection (b)(2) of this section shall include fair processes for the identification and timely resolution of any conflict between a reliability standard and any function, rule, order, tariff, rate schedule, or agreement accepted, approved, or ordered by the Commission applicable to a transmission organization. Such transmission organization shall continue to comply with such function, rule, order, tariff, rate schedule or agreement accepted, approved, or ordered by the Commission until&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Commission finds a conflict exists between a reliability standard and any such provision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Commission orders a change to such provision pursuant to section 824e of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the ordered change becomes effective under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Commission determines that a reliability standard needs to be changed as a result of such a conflict, it shall order the ERO to develop and file with the Commission a modified reliability standard under paragraph (4) or (5) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The ERO may impose, subject to paragraph (2), a penalty on a user or owner or operator of the bulk-power system for a violation of a reliability standard approved by the Commission under subsection (d) of this section if the ERO, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) finds that the user or owner or operator has violated a reliability standard approved by the Commission under subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) files notice and the record of the proceeding with the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A penalty imposed under paragraph (1) may take effect not earlier than the 31st day after the ERO files with the Commission notice of the penalty and the record of proceedings. Such penalty shall be subject to review by the Commission, on its own motion or upon application by the user, owner or operator that is the subject of the penalty filed within 30 days after the date such notice is filed with the Commission. Application to the Commission for review, or the initiation of review by the Commission on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay of such penalty unless the Commission otherwise orders upon its own motion or upon application by the user, owner or operator that is the subject of such penalty. In any proceeding to review a penalty imposed under paragraph (1), the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of the record before the ERO and opportunity for the presentation of supporting reasons to affirm, modify, or set aside the penalty), shall by order affirm, set aside, reinstate, or modify the penalty, and, if appropriate, remand to the ERO for further proceedings. The Commission shall implement expedited procedures for such hearings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On its own motion or upon complaint, the Commission may order compliance with a reli<!-- PDFPage:1306 -->ability standard and may impose a penalty against a user or owner or operator of the bulk-power system if the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the user or owner or operator of the bulk-power system has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices that constitute or will constitute a violation of a reliability standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall issue regulations authorizing the ERO to enter into an agreement to delegate authority to a regional entity for the purpose of proposing reliability standards to the ERO and enforcing reliability standards under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the regional entity is governed by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) an independent board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a balanced stakeholder board; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) a combination independent and balanced stakeholder board.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the regional entity otherwise satisfies the provisions of subsection (c)(1) and (2) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the agreement promotes effective and efficient administration of bulk-power system reliability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission may modify such delegation. The ERO and the Commission shall rebuttably presume that a proposal for delegation to a regional entity organized on an Interconnection-wide basis promotes effective and efficient administration of bulk-power system reliability and should be approved. Such regulation may provide that the Commission may assign the ERO's authority to enforce reliability standards under paragraph (1) directly to a regional entity consistent with the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission may take such action as is necessary or appropriate against the ERO or a regional entity to ensure compliance with a reliability standard or any Commission order affecting the ERO or a regional entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any penalty imposed under this section shall bear a reasonable relation to the seriousness of the violation and shall take into consideration the efforts of such user, owner, or operator to remedy the violation in a timely manner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Changes in Electric Reliability Organization rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Electric Reliability Organization shall file with the Commission for approval any proposed rule or proposed rule change, accompanied by an explanation of its basis and purpose. The Commission, upon its own motion or complaint, may propose a change to the rules of the ERO. A proposed rule or proposed rule change shall take effect upon a finding by the Commission, after notice and opportunity for comment, that the change is just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, is in the public interest, and satisfies the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reliability reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The ERO shall conduct periodic assessments of the reliability and adequacy of the bulk-power system in North America.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Coordination with Canada and Mexico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is urged to negotiate international agreements with the governments of Canada and Mexico to provide for effective compliance with reliability standards and the effectiveness of the ERO in the United States and Canada or Mexico.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Savings provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The ERO shall have authority to develop and enforce compliance with reliability standards for only the bulk-power system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not authorize the ERO or the Commission to order the construction of additional generation or transmission capacity or to set and enforce compliance with standards for adequacy or safety of electric facilities or services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt any authority of any State to take action to ensure the safety, adequacy, and reliability of electric service within that State, as long as such action is not inconsistent with any reliability standard, except that the State of New York may establish rules that result in greater reliability within that State, as long as such action does not result in lesser reliability outside the State than that provided by the reliability standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within 90 days of the application of the Electric Reliability Organization or other affected party, and after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission shall issue a final order determining whether a State action is inconsistent with a reliability standard, taking into consideration any recommendation of the ERO.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission, after consultation with the ERO and the State taking action, may stay the effectiveness of any State action, pending the Commission's issuance of a final order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Regional advisory bodies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall establish a regional advisory body on the petition of at least two-thirds of the States within a region that have more than one-half of their electric load served within the region. A regional advisory body shall be composed of one member from each participating State in the region, appointed by the Governor of each State, and may include representatives of agencies, States, and provinces outside the United States. A regional advisory body may provide advice to the Electric Reliability Organization, a regional entity, or the Commission regarding the governance of an existing or proposed regional entity within the same region, whether a standard proposed to apply within the region is just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest, whether fees proposed to be assessed within the region are just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest and any other responsibilities requested by the Commission. The Commission may give deference to the advice of any such regional advisory body if that body is organized on an Interconnection-wide basis.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Designation of national interest electric transmission corridors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005, and every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary of Energy (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;), in consultation with affected States, shall conduct a study of electric transmission congestion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After considering alternatives and recommendations from interested parties (including an opportunity for comment from affected States), the Secretary shall issue a report, based on the study, which may designate any geographic area experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers as a national interest electric transmission corridor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall conduct the study and issue the report in consultation with any appropriate regional entity referred to in section 824<em>o</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In determining whether to designate a national interest electric transmission corridor under paragraph (2), the Secretary may consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the economic vitality and development of the corridor, or the end markets served by the corridor, may be constrained by lack of adequate or reasonably priced electricity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) economic growth in the corridor, or the end markets served by the corridor, may be jeopardized by reliance on limited sources of energy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a diversification of supply is warranted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the energy independence of the United States would be served by the designation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the designation would be in the interest of national energy policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the designation would enhance national defense and homeland security.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction permit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, the Commission may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue one or more permits for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section if the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) a State in which the transmission facilities are to be constructed or modified does not have authority to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) approve the siting of the facilities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) consider the interstate benefits expected to be achieved by the proposed construction or modification of transmission facilities in the State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the applicant for a permit is a transmitting utility under this chapter but does not qualify to apply for a permit or siting approval for the proposed project in a State because the applicant does not serve end-use customers in the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a State commission or other entity that has authority to approve the siting of the facilities has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) withheld approval for more than 1 year after the filing of an application seeking approval pursuant to applicable law or 1 year after the designation of the relevant national interest electric transmission corridor, whichever is later; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) conditioned its approval in such a manner that the proposed construction or modification will not significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce or is not economically feasible;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the facilities to be authorized by the permit will be used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;distribution utility&rdquo; means an electric utility that has a service obligation to end-users or to a State utility or electric cooperative that, directly or indirectly, through one or more additional State utilities or electric cooperatives, provides electric service to end-users.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;load-serving entity&rdquo; means a distribution utility or an electric utility that has a service obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;service obligation&rdquo; means a requirement applicable to, or the exercise of authority granted to, an electric utility under Federal, State, or local law or under long-term contracts to provide electric service to end-users or to a distribution utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;State utility&rdquo; means a State or any political subdivision of a State, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or a corporation that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, competent to carry on the business of developing, transmitting, utilizing, or distributing power.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Meeting service obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Paragraph (2) applies to any load-serving entity that, as of August 8, 2005&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) owns generation facilities, markets the output of Federal generation facilities, or holds rights under one or more wholesale contracts to purchase electric energy, for the purpose of meeting a service obligation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by reason of ownership of transmission facilities, or one or more contracts or service agreements for firm transmission service, holds firm transmission rights for delivery of the output of the generation facilities or the purchased energy to meet the service obligation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any load-serving entity described in paragraph (1) is entitled to use the firm transmission rights, or, equivalent tradable or financial transmission rights, in order to deliver the output or purchased energy, or the output of other generating facilities or purchased energy to the extent deliverable using the rights, to the extent required to meet the service obligation of the load-serving entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) To the extent that all or a portion of the service obligation covered by the firm transmission rights or equivalent tradable or financial transmission rights is transferred to another load-serving entity, the successor load-serving entity shall be entitled to use the firm transmission rights or equivalent tradable or financial transmission rights associated with the transferred service obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subsequent transfers to another load-serving entity, or back to the original load-serving entity, shall be entitled to the same rights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall exercise the authority of the Commission under this chapter in a manner that facilitates the planning and expansion of transmission facilities to meet the reasonable needs of load-serving entities to satisfy the service obligations of the load-serving entities, and enables load-serving entities to secure firm transmission rights (or equivalent tradable or financial rights) on a long-term basis for long-term power supply arrangements made, or planned, to meet such needs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of transmission rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section shall affect any existing or future methodology employed by a Transmission Organization for allocating or auctioning transmission rights if such Transmission Organization was authorized by the Commission to allocate or auction financial transmission rights on its system as of January 1, 2005, and the Commission determines that any future allocation or auction is just, reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential, provided, however, that if such a Transmission Organization never allocated financial transmission rights on its system that pertained to a period before January 1, 2005, with respect to any application by such Transmission Organization that would change its methodology the Commission shall exercise its authority in a manner consistent with the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#824q_1_target" name="824q_1">1</a></sup> chapter and that takes into account the policies expressed in subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section as applied to firm transmission rights held by a load-serving entity as of January 1, 2005, to the extent the associated generation ownership or power purchase arrangements remain in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certain transmission rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may exercise authority under this chapter to make transmission rights not used to meet an obligation covered by subsection (b) of this section available to other entities in a manner determined by the Commission to be just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Obligation to build</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter relieves a load-serving entity from any obligation under State or local law to build transmission or distribution facilities adequate to meet the service obligations of the load-serving entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall provide a basis for abrogating any contract or service agree<!-- PDFPage:1311 -->ment for firm transmission service or rights in effect as of August 8, 2005. If an ISO in the Western Interconnection had allocated financial transmission rights prior to August 8, 2005, but had not done so with respect to one or more load-serving entities&rsquo; firm transmission rights held under contracts to which the preceding sentence applies (or held by reason of ownership or future ownership of transmission facilities), such load-serving entities may not be required, without their consent, to convert such firm transmission rights to tradable or financial rights, except where the load-serving entity has voluntarily joined the ISO as a participating transmission owner (or its successor) in accordance with the ISO tariff.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Water pumping facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall ensure that any entity described in section 824(f) of this title that owns transmission facilities used predominately to support its own water pumping facilities shall have, with respect to the facilities, protections for transmission service comparable to those provided to load-serving entities pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) ERCOT</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply within the area referred to in section 824k(k)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not authorize the Commission to take any action not otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) TVA area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section, a load-serving entity that is located within the service area of the Tennessee Valley Authority and that has a firm wholesale power supply contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority shall be considered to hold firm transmission rights for the transmission of the power provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection affects the requirements of section 824k(j) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall not issue an order on the basis of this subsection that is contrary to the purposes of section 824k(j) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Effect of exercising rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An entity that to the extent required to meet its service obligations exercises rights described in subsection (b) of this section shall not be considered by such action as engaging in undue discrimination or preference under this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;824t. Electricity market transparency rules</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission is directed to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale and transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, having due regard for the public interest, the integrity of those markets, fair competition, and the protection of consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may prescribe such rules as the Commission determines necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section. The rules shall provide for the dissemination, on a timely basis, of information about the availability and prices of wholesale electric energy and transmission service to the Commission, State commissions, buyers and sellers of wholesale electric energy, users of transmission services, and the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) obtain the information described in paragraph (2) from any market participant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) rely on entities other than the Commission to receive and make public the information, subject to the disclosure rules in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In carrying out this section, the Commission shall consider the degree of price transparency provided by existing price publishers and providers of trade processing services, and shall rely on such publishers and services to the maximum extent possible. The Commission may establish an electronic information system if it determines that existing price publications are not adequately providing price discovery or market transparency. Nothing in this section, however, shall affect any electronic information filing requirements in effect under this chapter as of August 8, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemption of information from disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Rules described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, if adopted, shall exempt from disclosure information the Commission determines would, if disclosed, be detrimental to the operation of an effective market or jeopardize system security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the information to be made available under this section and time to make the information available, the Commission shall seek to ensure that consumers and competitive markets are protected from the adverse effects of potential collusion or other anticompetitive behaviors that can be facilitated by untimely public disclosure of transaction-specific information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Information sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 180 days of August 8, 2005, the Commission shall conclude a memorandum of understanding with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission relating to information sharing, which shall include, among other things, provisions ensuring that information requests to markets within the respective jurisdiction of each agency are properly coordinated to minimize duplicative information requests, and provisions regarding the treatment of proprietary trading information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section may be construed to limit or affect the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exemption from reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall not require entities who have a de minimis market presence to comply with the reporting requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Penalties for violations occurring before notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall be subject to any civil penalty under this section with respect to any violation occurring more than 3 years before the date on which the person is provided notice of the proposed penalty under section 825<em>o</em>&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any case in which the Commission finds that a seller that has entered into a contract for the sale of electric energy at wholesale or transmission service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission has engaged in fraudulent market manipulation activities materially affecting the contract in violation of section 824v of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) ERCOT utilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to a transaction for the purchase or sale of wholesale electric energy or transmission services within the area described in section 824k(k)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
