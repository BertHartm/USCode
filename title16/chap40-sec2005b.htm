<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) private grazing land constitutes nearly 1/2 of the non-Federal land of the United States and is basic to the environmental, social, and economic stability of rural communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private grazing land contains a complex set of interactions among soil, water, air, plants, and animals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) grazing land constitutes the single largest watershed cover type in the United States and contributes significantly to the quality and quantity of water available for all of the many uses of the land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) private grazing land constitutes the most extensive wildlife habitat in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) private grazing land can provide opportunities for improved nutrient management from land application of animal manures and other by-product nutrient resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) owners and managers of private grazing land need to continue to recognize conservation problems when the problems arise and receive sound technical assistance to improve or conserve grazing land resources to meet ecological and economic demands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) new science and technology must continually be made available in a practical manner so owners and managers of private grazing land may make informed decisions concerning vital grazing land resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) agencies of the Department with private grazing land responsibilities are the agencies that have the expertise and experience to provide technical assistance, education, and research to owners and managers of private grazing land for the long-term productivity and ecological health of grazing land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) although competing demands on private grazing land resources are greater than ever before, assistance to private owners and managers of private grazing land is currently limited and does not meet the demand and basic need for adequately sustaining or enhancing the private grazing land resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) private grazing land can be enhanced to provide many benefits to all citizens of the United States through voluntary cooperation among owners and managers of the land, local conservation districts, and the agencies of the Department responsible for providing assistance to owners and managers of land and to conservation districts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section to authorize the Secretary to provide a coordinated technical, educational, and related assistance program to conserve and enhance private grazing land resources and provide related benefits to all citizens of the United States by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establishing a coordinated and cooperative Federal, State, and local grazing conservation program for management of private grazing land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) strengthening technical, educational, and related assistance programs that provide assistance to owners and managers of private grazing land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) conserving and improving wildlife habitat on private grazing land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) conserving and improving fish habitat and aquatic systems through grazing land conservation treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) protecting and improving water quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) improving the dependability and consistency of water supplies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) identifying and managing weed, noxious weed, and brush encroachment problems on private grazing land; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) integrating conservation planning and management decisions by owners and managers of private grazing land, on a voluntary basis.</p>
