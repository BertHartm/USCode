<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any fishery management plan prepared, and any regulation promulgated to implement any such plan, pursuant to this subchapter shall be consistent with the following national standards for fishery conservation and management:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the United States fishing industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Conservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the extent practicable, an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Conservation and management measures shall not discriminate between residents of different States. If it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various United States fishermen, such allocation shall be (A) fair and equitable to all such fishermen; (B) reasonably calculated to promote conservation; and (C) carried out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, consider efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources; except that no such measure shall have economic allocation as its sole purpose.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1842 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Conservation and management measures shall take into account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, fishery resources, and catches.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Conservation and management measures shall, consistent with the conservation requirements of this chapter (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data that meet the requirements of paragraph (2), in order to (A) provide for the sustained participation of such communities, and (B) to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, (A) minimize bycatch and (B) to the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such bycatch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, promote the safety of human life at sea.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish advisory guidelines (which shall not have the force and effect of law), based on the national standards, to assist in the development of fishery management plans.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the spouse, minor child, or partner of that individual; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Secretary, in consultation with the Councils and by not later than one year from October 11, 1996, shall promulgate regulations which prohibit an affected individual from voting in accordance with subparagraph (A), and which allow for the making of determinations under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1870 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Preparation and implementation of secretarial plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection also applies to a plan prepared and implemented by the Secretary under section 1854(c) or 1854(g) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Characteristics</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A limited access privilege established after January 12, 2007, is a permit issued for a period of not more than 10 years that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be renewed before the end of that period, unless it has been revoked, limited, or modified as provided in this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will be revoked, limited, or modified if the holder is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing under section 554 of title 5, to have failed to comply with any term of the plan identified in the plan as cause for revocation, limitation, or modification of a permit, which may include conservation requirements established under the plan;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Secretary does not notify a Council within 30 days of the end of the comment period of the approval, disapproval, or partial approval of a plan or amendment, then such plan or amendment shall take effect as if approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary disapproves or partially approves a plan or amendment, the Council may submit a revised plan or amendment to the Secretary for review under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, the term &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; means on or before the 5th day after the day on which a Council transmits to the Secretary a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulation that the Council characterizes as final.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon transmittal by the Council to the Secretary of proposed regulations prepared under section 1853(c) of this title, the Secretary shall immediately initiate an evaluation of the proposed regulations to determine whether they are consistent with the fishery management plan, plan amendment, this chapter and other applicable law.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Establishment of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall by regulation establish the level of any fees which are authorized to be charged pursuant to section 1853(b)(1) of this title. The Secretary may enter into a cooperative agreement with the States concerned under which the States administer the permit system and the agreement may provide that all or part of the fees collected under the system shall accrue to the States. The level of fees charged under this subsection shall not exceed the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary is authorized and shall collect a fee to recover the actual costs directly related to the management, data collection, and enforcement of any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) limited access privilege program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) community development quota program that allocates a percentage of the total allowable catch of a fishery to such program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such fee shall not exceed 3 percent of the ex-vessel value of fish harvested under any such program, and shall be collected at either the time of the landing, filing of a landing report, or sale of such fish during a fishing season or in the last quarter of the calendar year in which the fish is harvested.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rebuilding overfished fisheries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall report annually to the Congress and the Councils on the status of fisheries within each Council's geographical area of authority and identify those fisheries that are overfished or are approaching a condition of being overfished. For those fisheries managed under a fishery management plan or international agreement, the status shall be determined using the criteria for overfishing specified in such plan or agreement. A fishery shall be classified as approaching a condition of being overfished if, based on trends in fishing effort, fishery resource size, and other appropriate factors, the Secretary estimates that the fishery will become overfished within two years.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1873 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines at any time that a fishery is overfished, the Secretary shall immediately notify the appropriate Council and request that action be taken to end overfishing in the fishery and to implement conservation and management measures to rebuild affected stocks of fish. The Secretary shall publish each notice under this paragraph in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within one year of an identification under paragraph (1) or notification under paragraphs (2) or (7), the appropriate Council (or the Secretary, for fisheries under section 1852(a)(3) of this title) shall prepare a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations for the fishery to which the identification or notice applies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to end overfishing in the fishery and to rebuild affected stocks of fish; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prevent overfishing from occurring in the fishery whenever such fishery is identified as approaching an overfished condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For a fishery that is overfished, any fishery management plan, amendment, or proposed regulations prepared pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (5) for such fishery shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify a time period for ending overfishing and rebuilding the fishery that shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be as short as possible, taking into account the status and biology of any overfished stocks of fish, the needs of fishing communities, recommendations by international organizations in which the United States participates, and the interaction of the overfished stock of fish within the marine ecosystem; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not exceed 10 years, except in cases where the biology of the stock of fish, other environmental conditions, or management measures under an international agreement in which the United States participates dictate otherwise;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) allocate both overfishing restrictions and recovery benefits fairly and equitably among sectors of the fishery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for fisheries managed under an international agreement, reflect traditional participation in the fishery, relative to other nations, by fishermen of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, within the one-year period beginning on the date of identification or notification that a fishery is overfished, the Council does not submit to the Secretary a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary shall prepare a fishery management plan or plan amendment and any accompanying regulations to stop overfishing and rebuild affected stocks of fish within 9 months under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) During the development of a fishery management plan, a plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by this subsection, the Council may request the Secretary to implement interim measures to reduce overfishing under section 1855(c) of this title until such measures can be replaced by such plan, amendment, or regulations. Such measures, if otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, may be implemented even though they are not sufficient by themselves to stop overfishing of a fishery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall review any fishery management plan, plan amendment, or regulations required by this subsection at routine intervals that may not exceed two years. If the Secretary finds as a result of the review that such plan, amendment, or regulations have not resulted in adequate progress toward ending overfishing and rebuilding affected fish stocks, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a fishery to which section 1852(a)(3) of this title applies, immediately make revisions necessary to achieve adequate progress; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for all other fisheries, immediately notify the appropriate Council. Such notification shall recommend further conservation and management measures which the Council should consider under paragraph (3) to achieve adequate progress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Fisheries under authority of more than one Council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3),<sup><a href="#1854_1_target" name="1854_1">1</a></sup> if any fishery extends beyond the geographical area of authority of any one Council, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) designate which Council shall prepare the fishery management plan for such fishery and any amendment to such plan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may require that the plan and amendment be prepared jointly by the Councils concerned.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as extending or diminishing the jurisdiction or authority of any State within its boundaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the jurisdiction and authority of a State shall extend&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to any pocket of waters that is adjacent to the State and totally enclosed by lines delimiting the territorial sea of the United States pursuant to the Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone or any successor convention to which the United States is a party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the body of water commonly known as Nantucket Sound, to the pocket of water west of the seventieth meridian west of Greenwich; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to the waters of southeastern Alaska (for the purpose of regulating fishing for other than any species of crab) that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) north of the line representing the international boundary at Dixon Entrance and the westward extension of that line; east of 138 degrees west longitude; and not more than three nautical miles seaward from the coast, from the lines extending from headland to headland across all bays, inlets, straits, passes, sounds, and entrances, and from any island or group of islands, including the islands of the Alexander Archipelago (except Forrester Island); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) between the islands referred to in clause (i) (except Forrester Island) and the mainland.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State may regulate a fishing vessel outside the boundaries of the State in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The fishing vessel is registered under the law of that State, and (i) there is no fishery <!-- PDFPage:1887 -->management plan or other applicable Federal fishing regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is operating; or (ii) the State's laws and regulations are consistent with the fishery management plan and applicable Federal fishing regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is operating.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The fishery management plan for the fishery in which the fishing vessel is operating delegates management of the fishery to a State and the State's laws and regulations are consistent with such fishery management plan. If at any time the Secretary determines that a State law or regulation applicable to a fishing vessel under this circumstance is not consistent with the fishery management plan, the Secretary shall promptly notify the State and the appropriate Council of such determination and provide an opportunity for the State to correct any inconsistencies identified in the notification. If, after notice and opportunity for corrective action, the State does not correct the inconsistencies identified by the Secretary, the authority granted to the State under this subparagraph shall not apply until the Secretary and the appropriate Council find that the State has corrected the inconsistencies. For a fishery for which there was a fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996 that did not delegate management of the fishery to a State as of that date, the authority provided by this subparagraph applies only if the Council approves the delegation of management of the fishery to the State by a three-quarters majority vote of the voting members of the Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The fishing vessel is not registered under the law of the State of Alaska and is operating in a fishery in the exclusive economic zone off Alaska for which there was no fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996, and the Secretary and the North Pacific Council find that there is a legitimate interest of the State of Alaska in the conservation and management of such fishery. The authority provided under this subparagraph shall terminate when a fishery management plan under this chapter is approved and implemented for such fishery.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the fishing in a fishery, which is covered by a fishery management plan implemented under this chapter, is engaged in predominately within the exclusive economic zone and beyond such zone; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any State has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, the results of which will substantially and adversely affect the carrying out of such fishery management plan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall promptly notify such State and the appropriate Council of such finding and of his intention to regulate the applicable fishery within the boundaries of such State (other than its internal waters), pursuant to such fishery management plan and the regulations promulgated to implement such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary, pursuant to this subsection, assumes responsibility for the regulation of any fishery, the State involved may at any time thereafter apply to the Secretary for reinstatement of its authority over such fishery. If the Secretary finds that the reasons for which he assumed such regulation no longer prevail, he shall promptly terminate such regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the State involved requests that a hearing be held pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall conduct such hearing prior to taking any action under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception regarding foreign fish processing in internal waters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A foreign fishing vessel may engage in fish processing within the internal waters of a State if, and only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the vessel is qualified for purposes of this paragraph pursuant to paragraph (4)(C) or has received a permit under section 1824(d) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owner or operator of the vessel applies to the Governor of the State for, and (subject to paragraph (2)) is granted, permission for the vessel to engage in such processing and the application specifies the species to be processed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the owner or operator of the vessel submits reports on the tonnage of fish received from vessels of the United States and the locations from which such fish were harvested, in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary by regulation shall prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Governor of a State may not grant permission for a foreign fishing vessel to engage in fish processing under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for a fishery which occurs in the waters of more than one State or in the exclusive economic zone, except after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) consulting with the appropriate Council and Marine Fisheries Commission, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) considering any comments received from the Governor of any other State where the fishery occurs; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Governor determines that fish processors within the State have adequate capacity, and will utilize such capacity, to process all of the United States harvested fish from the fishery concerned that are landed in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection may be construed as relieving a foreign fishing vessel from the duty to comply with all applicable Federal and State laws while operating within the internal waters of a State incident to permission obtained under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;fish processing&rdquo; includes, in addition to processing, the performance of any other activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, or transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The phrase &ldquo;internal waters of a State&rdquo; means all waters within the boundaries of a State except those seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A foreign fishing vessel shall be treated as qualified for purposes of paragraph (1) if the foreign nation under which it is flagged will be a party to (i) a governing international fishery agreement or (ii) a treaty described in section <!-- PDFPage:1888 -->1821(b) of this title during the time the vessel will engage in the fish processing for which permission is sought under paragraph (1)(B).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assessment of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have committed an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary, or his designee, by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, and such other matters as justice may require. In assessing such penalty the Secretary may also consider any information provided by the violator relating to the ability of the violator to pay, <em>Provided</em>, That the information is served on the Secretary at least 30 days prior to an administrative hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review of civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under subsection (a) of this section or against whom a permit sanction is imposed under subsection (g) of this section (other than a permit suspension for nonpayment of penalty or fine) may obtain review thereof in the United States district court for the appropriate district by filing a complaint against the Secretary in such court within 30 days from the date of such order. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such penalty imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court if they are not found to be supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action upon failure to pay assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appro<!-- PDFPage:1892 -->priate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) In rem jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fishing vessel (including its fishing gear, furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used in the commission of an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title shall be liable in rem for any civil penalty assessed for such violation under this section and may be proceeded against in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof. Such penalty shall constitute a maritime lien on such vessel which may be recovered in an action in rem in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction over the vessel.</p>

Before making funds available for an activity authorized under this section, the Secretary shall make a determination that such activity will not expand the size or scope of the commercial fishery failure in that fishery or into other fisheries or other geographic regions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Federal share of the cost of any activity carried out under the authority of this subsection shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of that activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as are necessary for each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2013.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fishing capacity reduction program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, at the request of the appropriate Council for fisheries under the authority of such Council, the Governor of a State for fisheries under State authority, or a majority of permit holders in the fishery, may conduct a voluntary fishing capacity reduction program (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;program&rdquo;) in a fishery if the Secretary determines that the program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is necessary to prevent or end overfishing, rebuild stocks of fish, or achieve measurable and significant improvements in the conservation and management of the fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is consistent with the Federal or State fishery management plan or program in effect for such fishery, as appropriate, and that the fishery management plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will prevent the replacement of fishing capacity removed by the program through a moratorium on new entrants, practicable restrictions on vessel upgrades, and other effort control measures, taking into account the full potential fishing capacity of the fleet; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) establishes a specified or target total allowable catch or other measures that trigger closure of the fishery or adjustments to reduce catch; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is cost-effective and, in the instance of a program involving an industry fee system, prospectively capable of repaying any debt obligation incurred under section 53735 of title 46.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The objective of the program shall be to obtain the maximum sustained reduction in fishing capacity at the least cost and in a minimum period of time. To achieve that objective, the Secretary is authorized to pay&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the owner of a fishing vessel, if the permit authorizing the participation of the vessel in the fishery is surrendered for permanent revocation and the vessel owner and permit holder relinquish any claim associated with the vessel or permit that could qualify such owner or holder for any present or future limited access system permit in the fishery for which the program is established or in any other fishery and such vessel is (i) scrapped, or (ii) through the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, subjected to title restrictions (including loss of the vessel's fisheries endorsement) that permanently prohibit and effectively prevent its use in fishing in federal&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1861a_1_target" name="1861a_1">1</a></sup> or state&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1861a_1_target" name="1861a_1">1</a></sup> waters, or fishing on the high seas or in the waters of a foreign nation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the holder of a permit authorizing participation in the fishery, if such permit is surrendered for permanent revocation, and such holder relinquishes any claim associated with the permit and vessel used to harvest fishery resources under the permit that could qualify such holder for any present or future limited access system permit in the fishery for which the program was established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Participation in the program shall be voluntary, but the Secretary shall ensure compliance by all who do participate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The harvester proponents of each program and the Secretary shall consult, as appropriate and practicable, with Councils, Federal agencies, State and regional authorities, affected fishing communities, participants in the fishery, conservation organizations, and other interested parties throughout the development and implementation of any program under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Payment condition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not make a payment under paragraph (2) with respect to a vessel that will not be scrapped unless the Secretary certifies that the vessel will not be used for fishing in the waters of a foreign nation or fishing on the high seas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Report.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary shall, within 12 months after January 12, 2007, submit to the Congress a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) identifying and describing the 20 fisheries in United States waters with the most severe examples of excess harvesting capacity in the fisheries, based on value of each fishery and the amount of excess harvesting capacity as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) recommending measures for reducing such excess harvesting capacity, including the retirement of any latent fishing permits that could contribute to further excess harvesting capacity in those fisheries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) potential sources of funding for such measures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Basis for recommendations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall base the recommendations made with respect to a fishery on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the most cost effective means of achieving voluntary reduction in capacity for the fishery using the potential for industry financing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) including measures to prevent the capacity that is being removed from the fish<!-- PDFPage:1900 -->ery from moving to other fisheries in the United States, in the waters of a foreign nation, or on the high seas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The program may be funded by any combination of amounts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) available under clause (iv) of section 713c&ndash;3(b)(1)(A) of title 15;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) appropriated for the purposes of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provided by an industry fee system established under subsection (d) of this section and in accordance with section 53735 of title 46; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All funds for the program, including any fees established under subsection (d) of this section, shall be paid into the fishing capacity reduction fund established under section 53735 of title 46.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Industry fee system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) If an industry fee system is necessary to fund the program, the Secretary may conduct a referendum on such system. Prior to the referendum, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) identify, to the extent practicable, and notify all permit or vessel owners who would be affected by the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) make available to such owners information about the industry fee system describing the schedule, procedures, and eligibility requirements for the referendum, the proposed program, and the amount and duration and any other terms and conditions of the proposed fee system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The industry fee system shall be considered approved if the referendum votes which are cast in favor of the proposed system constitute at least a majority of the permit holders in the fishery, or 50 percent of the permitted allocation of the fishery, who participated in the fishery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding section 1854(d) of this title and consistent with an approved industry fee system, the Secretary is authorized to establish such a system to fund the program and repay debt obligations incurred pursuant to section 53735 of title 46. The fees for a program established under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be determined by the Secretary and adjusted from time to time as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to repay such debt obligations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not exceed 5 percent of the ex-vessel value of all fish harvested from the fishery for which the program is established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be deducted by the first ex-vessel fish purchaser from the proceeds otherwise payable to the seller and accounted for and forwarded by such fish purchasers to the Secretary in such manner as the Secretary may establish, unless the Secretary determines that such fees should be collected from the seller; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be in effect only until such time as the debt obligation has been fully paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Implementation plan</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Framework regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall propose and adopt framework regulations applicable to the implementation of all programs under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Program regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall implement each program under this section by promulgating regulations that, together with the framework regulations, establish each program and control its implementation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Harvester proponents&rsquo; implementation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not propose implementation regulations for a program to be paid for by an industry fee system until the harvester proponents of the program provide to the Secretary a proposed implementation plan that, among other matters&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) proposes the types and numbers of vessels or permits that are eligible to participate in the program and the manner in which the program shall proceed, taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the requirements of the framework regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the characteristics of the fishery and affected fishing communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the requirements of the applicable fishery management plan and any amendment that such plan may require to support the proposed program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the general needs and desires of harvesters in the fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) the need to minimize program costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) other matters, including the manner in which such proponents propose to fund the program to ensure its cost effectiveness, as well as any relevant factors demonstrating the potential for, or necessary to obtain, the support and general cooperation of a substantial number of affected harvesters in the fishery (or portion of the fishery) for which the program is intended; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) proposes procedures for program participation (such as submission of owner bids under an auction system or fair market-value assessment), including any terms and conditions for participation, that the harvester proponents deem to be reasonably necessary to meet the program's proposed objectives.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Participation contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall contract with each person participating in a program, and each such contract shall, in addition to including such other matters as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to effectively implement each program (including penalties for contract non-performance) be consistent with the framework and implementing regulations and all other applicable law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reduction auctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each program not involving fair market assessment shall involve a reduction auction that scores the reduction price of each bid offer by the data relevant to each bidder under an appropriate fisheries productivity factor. If the Secretary accepts bids, the Secretary shall <!-- PDFPage:1901 -->accept responsive bids in the rank order of their bid scores, starting with the bid whose reduction price is the lowest percentage of the productivity factor, and successively accepting each additional responsive bid in rank order until either there are no more responsive bids or acceptance of the next bid would cause the total value of bids accepted to exceed the amount of funds available for the program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Bid invitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each program shall proceed by the Secretary issuing invitations to bid setting out the terms and conditions for participation consistent with the framework and implementing regulations. Each bid that the Secretary receives in response to the invitation to bid shall constitute an irrevocable offer from the bidder.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) comprehensive commercial insurance is available for all fishing vessels and United States fish processors required to have observers under the provisions of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such comprehensive commercial insurance will provide a greater measure of coverage at a lower cost to each participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Bycatch reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In implementing section 1853(a)(11) of this title and this section, the North Pacific Council shall submit conservation and management measures to lower, on an annual basis for a period of not less than four years, the total amount of economic discards occurring in the fisheries under its jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Bycatch reduction incentives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding section 1854(d) of this title, the North Pacific Council may submit, and the Secretary may approve, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, a system of fines in a fishery to provide incentives to reduce bycatch and bycatch rates; except that such fines shall not exceed $25,000 per vessel per season. Any fines collected shall be deposited in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund, and may be made available by the Secretary to offset costs related to the reduction of bycatch in the fishery from which such fines were derived, including conservation and management measures and research, and to the State of Alaska to offset costs incurred by the State in the fishery from which such penalties were derived or in fisheries in which the State is directly involved in management or enforcement and which are directly affected by the fishery from which such penalties were derived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding section 1853(d) of this title, and in addition to the authority provided in section 1853(b)(10) of this title, the North Pacific Council may submit, and the Secretary may approve, conservation and management measures which provide allocations of regulatory discards to individual fishing vessels as an incentive to reduce per vessel bycatch and bycatch rates in a fishery, <em>Provided</em>, That&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such allocations may not be transferred for monetary consideration and are made only on an annual basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any such conservation and management measures will meet the requirements of subsection (h) of this section and will result in an actual reduction in regulatory discards in the fishery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The North Pacific Council may submit restrictions in addition to the restriction imposed by clause (i) of subparagraph (A) on the transferability of any such allocations, and the Secretary may approve such recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Catch measurement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) By June 1, 1997 the North Pacific Council shall submit, and the Secretary may approve, consistent with the other provisions of this chapter, conservation and management measures to ensure total catch measurement in each fishery under the jurisdiction of such Council. Such measures shall ensure the accurate enumeration, at a minimum, of target species, economic discards, and regulatory discards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the extent the measures submitted under paragraph (1) do not require United States fish processors and fish processing vessels (as defined in chapter 21 of title 46) to weigh fish, the North Pacific Council and the Secretary shall submit a plan to the Congress by January 1, 1998, to allow for weighing, including recommendations to assist such processors and processing vessels in acquiring necessary equipment, unless the Council determines that such weighing is not necessary to meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Full retention and utilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The North Pacific Council shall submit to the Secretary by October 1, 1998 a report on the advisability of requiring the full retention by fishing vessels and full utilization by United States fish processors of economic discards in fisheries under its jurisdiction if such economic discards, or the mortality of such economic discards, cannot be avoided. The report shall address the projected impacts of such requirements on participants in the fishery and describe any full retention and full utilization requirements that have been implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The report shall address the advisability of measures to minimize processing waste, including standards setting minimum percentages which must be processed for human consumption. For the purpose of the report, &ldquo;processing waste&rdquo; means that portion of any fish which is processed and which could be used for human consumption or other commercial use, but which is not so used.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab rationalization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) By not later than January 1, 2005, the Secretary shall approve and hereafter&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1862_2_target" name="1862_2">2</a></sup> implement by regulation the Voluntary Three-Pie Cooperative Program for crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands approved by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council between June 2002 and April 2003, and all trailing amendments <!-- PDFPage:1904 -->including those reported to Congress on May 6, 2003. This section shall not preclude the Secretary from approving by January 1, 2005, and implementing any subsequent program amendments approved by the Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in carrying out paragraph (1) the Secretary shall approve all parts of the Program referred to in such paragraph. Further, no part of such Program may be implemented if, as approved by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, individual fishing quotas, processing quotas, community development quota allocation, voluntary cooperatives, binding arbitration, regional landing and processing requirements, community protections, economic data collection, or the loan program for crab fishing vessel captains and crew members, is invalidated subject to a judicial determination not subject to judicial appeal. If the Secretary determines that a processor has leveraged its Individual Processor Quota shares to acquire a harvesters open-delivery &ldquo;B shares&rdquo;, the processor's Individual Processor Quota shares shall be forfeited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subsequent to implementation pursuant to paragraph (1), the Council may submit and the Secretary may implement changes to or repeal of conservation and management measures, including measures authorized in this section, for crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands in accordance with applicable law, including this chapter as amended by this subsection, to achieve on a continuing basis the purposes identified by the Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The loan program referred to in paragraph (2) shall be carried out pursuant to the authority of sections 53735 and 53702(b) of title 46.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of implementing this section $1,000,000 shall be made available each year until fully implemented from funds otherwise made available to the National Marine Fisheries Service for Alaska fisheries activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this chapter shall constitute a waiver, either express or implied, of the antitrust laws of the United States. The Secretary, in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, shall develop and implement a mandatory information collection and review process to provide any and all information necessary for the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether any illegal acts of anti-competition, anti-trust, or price collusion have occurred among persons receiving individual processing quotas under the Program. The Secretary may revoke any individual processing quota held by any person found to have violated a provision of the antitrust laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) An individual processing quota issued under the Program shall be considered a permit for the purposes of sections 1857, 1858, and 1859 of this title, and may be revoked or limited at any time in accordance with this chapter. Issuance of an individual processing quota under the program shall not confer any right of compensation to the holder of such individual processing quota if it is revoked or limited and shall not create, or be construed to create, any right, title, or interest in or to any fish before the fish is purchased from an individual fishing quota holder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The restriction on the collection of economic data in section 1853 of this title shall not apply with respect to any fish processor who is eligible for, or who has received, individual processing quota under the Program. The restriction on the disclosure of information in section 1881a(b)(1) of this title shall not apply when the information is used to determine eligibility for or compliance with an individual processing quota program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The provisions of sections 1858, 1860, and 1861 of this title shall apply to the processing facilities and fish products of any person holding individual processing quota, and the provisions of subparagraphs (D), (E), and (L) of section 1857(<em>l</em>)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1862_3_target" name="1862_3">3</a></sup> of this title shall apply to any facility owned or controlled by a person holding individual processing quota.</p>
