<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any fishery management plan prepared, and any regulation promulgated to implement any such plan, pursuant to this subchapter shall be consistent with the following national standards for fishery conservation and management:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the United States fishing industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Conservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the extent practicable, an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Conservation and management measures shall not discriminate between residents of different States. If it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various United States fishermen, such allocation shall be (A) fair and equitable to all such fishermen; (B) reasonably calculated to promote conservation; and (C) carried out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, consider efficiency in <!-- PDFPage:1803 -->the utilization of fishery resources; except that no such measure shall have economic allocation as its sole purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Conservation and management measures shall take into account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, fishery resources, and catches.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Conservation and management measures shall, consistent with the conservation requirements of this chapter (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities in order to (A) provide for the sustained participation of such communities, and (B) to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, (A) minimize bycatch and (B) to the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such bycatch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, promote the safety of human life at sea.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish advisory guidelines (which shall not have the force and effect of law), based on the national standards, to assist in the development of fishery management plans.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Processing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under the authority of section 301(a)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1851(a)(4)), the North Pacific Council is directed to recommend for approval by the Secretary conservation and management measures to prevent any particular individual or entity from processing an excessive share of the pollock available to be harvested in the directed pollock fishery. In the event the North Pacific Council recommends and the Secretary approves an excessive processing share that is lower than 17.5 percent, any individual or entity that previously processed a percentage greater than such share shall be allowed to continue to process such percentage, except that their percentage may not exceed 17.5 percent (excluding pollock processed by catcher/processors that was harvested in the directed pollock fishery by catcher vessels eligible under 208(b)) and shall be reduced if their percentage decreases, until their percentage is below such share. In recommending the excessive processing share, the North Pacific Council shall consider the need of catcher vessels in the directed pollock fishery to have competitive buyers for the pollock harvested by such vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Review by maritime administration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the request of the North Pacific Council or the Secretary, any individual or entity believed by such Council or the Secretary to have exceeded the percentage in either paragraph (1) or (2) shall submit such information to the Administrator of the Maritime Administration as the Administrator deems appropriate to allow the Administrator to determine whether such individual or entity has exceeded either such percentage. The Administrator shall make a finding as soon as practicable upon such request and shall submit such finding to the North Pacific Council and the Secretary. For the purposes of this subsection, any entity in which 10 percent or more of the interest is owned or controlled by another individual or entity shall be considered to be the same entity as the other individual or entity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Secretary, in consultation with the Councils and by not later than one year from October 11, 1996, shall promulgate regulations which prohibit an affected individual from voting in accordance with subparagraph (A), and which allow for the making of determinations under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rebuilding overfished fisheries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall report annually to the Congress and the Councils on the status of fisheries within each Council's geographical area of authority and identify those fisheries that are overfished or are approaching a condition of being overfished. For those fisheries managed under a fishery management plan or international agreement, the status shall be determined using the criteria for overfishing specified in such plan or agreement. A fishery shall be classified as approaching a condition of being overfished if, based on trends in fishing effort, fishery resource size, and other appropriate factors, the Secretary estimates that the fishery will become overfished within two years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines at any time that a fishery is overfished, the Secretary shall immediately notify the appropriate Council and request that action be taken to end overfishing in the fishery and to implement conservation and management measures to rebuild affected stocks of fish. The Secretary shall publish each notice under this paragraph in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within one year of an identification under paragraph (1) or notification under paragraphs (2) or (7), the appropriate Council (or the Secretary, for fisheries under section 1852(a)(3) of this title) shall prepare a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations <!-- PDFPage:1827 -->for the fishery to which the identification or notice applies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to end overfishing in the fishery and to rebuild affected stocks of fish; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prevent overfishing from occurring in the fishery whenever such fishery is identified as approaching an overfished condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For a fishery that is overfished, any fishery management plan, amendment, or proposed regulations prepared pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (5) for such fishery shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify a time period for ending overfishing and rebuilding the fishery that shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be as short as possible, taking into account the status and biology of any overfished stocks of fish, the needs of fishing communities, recommendations by international organizations in which the United States participates, and the interaction of the overfished stock of fish within the marine ecosystem; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not exceed 10 years, except in cases where the biology of the stock of fish, other environmental conditions, or management measures under an international agreement in which the United States participates dictate otherwise;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) allocate both overfishing restrictions and recovery benefits fairly and equitably among sectors of the fishery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for fisheries managed under an international agreement, reflect traditional participation in the fishery, relative to other nations, by fishermen of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, within the one-year period beginning on the date of identification or notification that a fishery is overfished, the Council does not submit to the Secretary a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary shall prepare a fishery management plan or plan amendment and any accompanying regulations to stop overfishing and rebuild affected stocks of fish within 9 months under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) During the development of a fishery management plan, a plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by this subsection, the Council may request the Secretary to implement interim measures to reduce overfishing under section 1855(c) of this title until such measures can be replaced by such plan, amendment, or regulations. Such measures, if otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, may be implemented even though they are not sufficient by themselves to stop overfishing of a fishery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall review any fishery management plan, plan amendment, or regulations required by this subsection at routine intervals that may not exceed two years. If the Secretary finds as a result of the review that such plan, amendment, or regulations have not resulted in adequate progress toward ending overfishing and rebuilding affected fish stocks, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a fishery to which section 1852(a)(3) of this title applies, immediately make revisions necessary to achieve adequate progress; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for all other fisheries, immediately notify the appropriate Council. Such notification shall recommend further conservation and management measures which the Council should consider under paragraph (3) to achieve adequate progress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Fisheries under authority of more than one Council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3),<sup><a href="#1854_1_target" name="1854_1">1</a></sup> if any fishery extends beyond the geographical area of authority of any one Council, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) designate which Council shall prepare the fishery management plan for such fishery and any amendment to such plan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may require that the plan and amendment be prepared jointly by the Councils concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No jointly prepared plan or amendment may be submitted to the Secretary unless it is approved by a majority of the voting members, present and voting, of each Council concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall establish the boundaries between the geographical areas of authority of adjacent Councils.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as extending or diminishing the jurisdiction or authority of any State within its boundaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the jurisdiction and authority of a State shall extend&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to any pocket of waters that is adjacent to the State and totally enclosed by lines delimiting the territorial sea of the United States pursuant to the Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone or any successor convention to which the United States is a party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the body of water commonly known as Nantucket Sound, to the pocket of water west of the seventieth meridian west of Greenwich; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to the waters of southeastern Alaska (for the purpose of regulating fishing for other than any species of crab) that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) north of the line representing the international boundary at Dixon Entrance and the westward extension of that line; east of 138 degrees west longitude; and not more than three nautical miles seaward from the coast, from the lines extending from headland to headland across all bays, inlets, straits, passes, sounds, and entrances, and from any island or group of islands, including the islands of the Alexander Archipelago (except Forrester Island); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) between the islands referred to in clause (i) (except Forrester Island) and the mainland.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State may regulate a fishing vessel outside the boundaries of the State in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The fishing vessel is registered under the law of that State, and (i) there is no fishery management plan or other applicable Federal fishing regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is operating; or (ii) the State's laws and regulations are consistent with the fishery management plan and applicable Federal fishing regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is operating.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The fishery management plan for the fishery in which the fishing vessel is operating delegates management of the fishery to a State and the State's laws and regulations are consistent with such fishery management plan. If at any time the Secretary determines that a State law or regulation applicable to a fishing vessel under this circumstance is not <!-- PDFPage:1837 -->consistent with the fishery management plan, the Secretary shall promptly notify the State and the appropriate Council of such determination and provide an opportunity for the State to correct any inconsistencies identified in the notification. If, after notice and opportunity for corrective action, the State does not correct the inconsistencies identified by the Secretary, the authority granted to the State under this subparagraph shall not apply until the Secretary and the appropriate Council find that the State has corrected the inconsistencies. For a fishery for which there was a fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996 that did not delegate management of the fishery to a State as of that date, the authority provided by this subparagraph applies only if the Council approves the delegation of management of the fishery to the State by a three-quarters majority vote of the voting members of the Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The fishing vessel is not registered under the law of the State of Alaska and is operating in a fishery in the exclusive economic zone off Alaska for which there was no fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996, and the Secretary and the North Pacific Council find that there is a legitimate interest of the State of Alaska in the conservation and management of such fishery. The authority provided under this subparagraph shall terminate when a fishery management plan under this chapter is approved and implemented for such fishery.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the fishing in a fishery, which is covered by a fishery management plan implemented under this chapter, is engaged in predominately within the exclusive economic zone and beyond such zone; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any State has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, the results of which will substantially and adversely affect the carrying out of such fishery management plan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall promptly notify such State and the appropriate Council of such finding and of his intention to regulate the applicable fishery within the boundaries of such State (other than its internal waters), pursuant to such fishery management plan and the regulations promulgated to implement such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary, pursuant to this subsection, assumes responsibility for the regulation of any fishery, the State involved may at any time thereafter apply to the Secretary for reinstatement of its authority over such fishery. If the Secretary finds that the reasons for which he assumed such regulation no longer prevail, he shall promptly terminate such regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the State involved requests that a hearing be held pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall conduct such hearing prior to taking any action under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception regarding foreign fish processing in internal waters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A foreign fishing vessel may engage in fish processing within the internal waters of a State if, and only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the vessel is qualified for purposes of this paragraph pursuant to paragraph (4)(C) or has received a permit under section 1824(d) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owner or operator of the vessel applies to the Governor of the State for, and (subject to paragraph (2)) is granted, permission for the vessel to engage in such processing and the application specifies the species to be processed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the owner or operator of the vessel submits reports on the tonnage of fish received from vessels of the United States and the locations from which such fish were harvested, in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary by regulation shall prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Governor of a State may not grant permission for a foreign fishing vessel to engage in fish processing under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for a fishery which occurs in the waters of more than one State or in the exclusive economic zone, except after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) consulting with the appropriate Council and Marine Fisheries Commission, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) considering any comments received from the Governor of any other State where the fishery occurs; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Governor determines that fish processors within the State have adequate capacity, and will utilize such capacity, to process all of the United States harvested fish from the fishery concerned that are landed in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection may be construed as relieving a foreign fishing vessel from the duty to comply with all applicable Federal and State laws while operating within the internal waters of a State incident to permission obtained under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;fish processing&rdquo; includes, in addition to processing, the performance of any other activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, or transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The phrase &ldquo;internal waters of a State&rdquo; means all waters within the boundaries of a State except those seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A foreign fishing vessel shall be treated as qualified for purposes of paragraph (1) if the foreign nation under which it is flagged will be a party to (i) a governing international fishery agreement or (ii) a treaty described in section 1821(b) of this title during the time the vessel will engage in the fish processing for which permission is sought under paragraph (1)(B).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assessment of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have committed an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary, or his designee, by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, and such other matters as justice may require. In assessing such penalty the Secretary may also consider any information provided by the violator relating to the ability of the violator to pay, <em>Provided</em>, That the information is served on the Secretary at least 30 days prior to an administrative hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review of civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under subsection (a) of this section or against whom a permit sanction is imposed under subsection (g) of this section (other than a permit suspension for nonpayment of penalty or fine) may obtain review thereof in the United States district court for the appropriate district by filing a complaint against the Secretary in such court within 30 days from the date of such order. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such penalty imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the discretion of the Secretary or at the request of the Governor of an affected State or a fishing community, the Secretary shall determine whether there is a commercial fishery failure due to a fishery resource disaster as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) natural causes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) man-made causes beyond the control of fishery managers to mitigate through conservation and management measures; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the determination under paragraph (1) that there is a commercial fishery failure, the Secretary is authorized to make sums available to be used by the affected State, fishing community, or by the Secretary in cooperation with the affected State or fishing community for assessing the economic and social effects of the commercial fishery failure, or any activity that the Secretary determines is appropriate to restore the fishery or prevent a similar failure in the future and to assist a fishing community affected by such failure. Before making funds available for an activity authorized under this section, the Secretary shall make a determination that such activity will not expand the size or scope of the commercial fishery failure in that fishery or into other fisheries or other geographic regions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is consistent with the Federal or State fishery management plan or program in effect for such fishery, as appropriate, and that the fishery management plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will prevent the replacement of fishing capacity removed by the program through a moratorium on new entrants, restrictions on vessel upgrades, and other effort control measures, taking into account the full potential fishing capacity of the fleet; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) establishes a specified or target total allowable catch or other measures that trigger closure of the fishery or adjustments to reduce catch; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The objective of the program shall be to obtain the maximum sustained reduction in fishing capacity at the least cost and in a minimum period of time. To achieve that objective, the Secretary is authorized to pay&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the owner of a fishing vessel, if such vessel is (i) scrapped, or (ii) through the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, subjected to title restrictions that permanently prohibit and effectively prevent its use in fishing, and if the permit authorizing the participation of the vessel in the fishery is surrendered for permanent revocation and the owner relinquishes any claim associated with the vessel and permit that could qualify such owner for any present or future limited access system permit in the fishery for which the program is established; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the holder of a permit authorizing participation in the fishery, if such permit is sur<!-- PDFPage:1848 -->rendered for permanent revocation, and such holder relinquishes any claim associated with the permit and vessel used to harvest fishery resources under the permit that could qualify such holder for any present or future limited access system permit in the fishery for which the program was established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Participation in the program shall be voluntary, but the Secretary shall ensure compliance by all who do participate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall consult, as appropriate, with Councils, Federal agencies, State and regional authorities, affected fishing communities, participants in the fishery, conservation organizations, and other interested parties throughout the development and implementation of any program under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be consistent with applicable provisions of law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) take into consideration the operating requirements of the fisheries and the safety of observers and fishermen.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any system of fees established under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide that the total amount of fees collected under this section not exceed the combined cost of (i) stationing observers on board fishing vessels and United States fish processors, (ii) the actual cost of inputting collected data, and (iii) assessments necessary for a risk-sharing pool implemented under subsection (e) of this section, less any amount received for such purpose from another source or from an existing surplus in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund established in subsection (d) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be fair and equitable to all participants in the fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Council, including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide that fees collected not be used to pay any costs of administrative overhead or other costs not directly incurred in carrying out the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) not be used to offset amounts authorized under other provisions of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) be expressed as a percentage, not to exceed 2 percent, of the unprocessed ex-vessel value of fish and shellfish harvested under the jurisdiction of the Council, including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) be assessed against all fishing vessels and United States fish processors, including those not required to carry an observer under the plan, participating in fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Council, including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) provide that fees collected will be deposited in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund established under subsection (d) of this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) meet the requirements of section 9701(b) of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 60 days after receiving a plan or plan amendment from the North Pacific Council under this section, the Secretary shall review such plan or plan amendment and either (A) remand such plan or plan amendment to the Council with comments if it does not meet the requirements of this section, or (B) publish in the Federal Register proposed regulations for implementing such plan or plan amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the 60-day public comment period, the Secretary shall conduct a public hearing in each State represented on the Council for the purpose of receiving public comments on the proposed regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 45 days of the close of the public comment period, the Secretary, in consultation with the Council, shall analyze the public comment received and publish final regulations for implementing such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary remands a plan or plan amendment to the Council for failure to meet the requirements of this section, the Council may resubmit such plan or plan amendment at any time after taking action the Council believes will address the defects identified by the Secretary. Any plan or plan amendment resubmitted to the Secretary will be treated as an original plan submitted to the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fishery Observer Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established in the Treasury a North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund. The Fund shall be available, without appropriation or fiscal year limitation, only to the Secretary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this <!-- PDFPage:1850 -->section, subject to the restrictions in subsection (b)(2) of this section. The Fund shall consist of all monies deposited into it in accordance with this section. Sums in the Fund that are not currently needed for the purposes of this section shall be kept on deposit or invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special provisions regarding observers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the availability of comprehensive commercial insurance for vessel and owner liability against civil suits by observers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines that a risk sharing pool is feasible, the Secretary shall establish such a pool, subject to the provisions of subsection (b)(2) of this section, unless the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) comprehensive commercial insurance is available for all fishing vessels and United States fish processors required to have observers under the provisions of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such comprehensive commercial insurance will provide a greater measure of coverage at a lower cost to each participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Bycatch reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In implementing section 1853(a)(11) of this title and this section, the North Pacific Council shall submit conservation and management measures to lower, on an annual basis for a period of not less than four years, the total amount of economic discards occurring in the fisheries under its jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Bycatch reduction incentives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding section 1854(d) of this title, the North Pacific Council may submit, and the Secretary may approve, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, a system of fines in a fishery to provide incentives to reduce bycatch and bycatch rates; except that such fines shall not exceed $25,000 per vessel per season. Any fines collected shall be deposited in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund, and may be made available by the Secretary to offset costs related to the reduction of bycatch in the fishery from which such fines were derived, including conservation and management measures and research, and to the State of Alaska to offset costs incurred by the State in the fishery from which such penalties were derived or in fisheries in which the State is directly involved in management or enforcement and which are directly affected by the fishery from which such penalties were derived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding section 1853(d) of this title, and in addition to the authority provided in section 1853(b)(10) of this title, the North Pacific Council may submit, and the Secretary may approve, conservation and management measures which provide allocations of regulatory discards to individual fishing vessels as an incentive to reduce per vessel bycatch and bycatch rates in a fishery, <em>Provided</em>, That&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such allocations may not be transferred for monetary consideration and are made only on an annual basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any such conservation and management measures will meet the requirements of subsection (h) of this section and will result in an actual reduction in regulatory discards in the fishery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The North Pacific Council may submit restrictions in addition to the restriction imposed by clause (i) of subparagraph (A) on the transferability of any such allocations, and the Secretary may approve such recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Catch measurement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) By June 1, 1997 the North Pacific Council shall submit, and the Secretary may approve, consistent with the other provisions of this chapter, conservation and management measures to ensure total catch measurement in each fishery under the jurisdiction of such Council. Such measures shall ensure the accurate enumeration, at a minimum, of target species, economic discards, and regulatory discards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the extent the measures submitted under paragraph (1) do not require United States fish processors and fish processing vessels (as defined in chapter 21 of title 46) to weigh fish, the North Pacific Council and the Secretary shall submit a plan to the Congress by January 1, 1998, to allow for weighing, including recommendations to assist such processors and processing vessels in acquiring necessary equipment, unless the Council determines that such weighing is not necessary to meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Full retention and utilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The North Pacific Council shall submit to the Secretary by October 1, 1998 a report on the advisability of requiring the full retention by fishing vessels and full utilization by United States fish processors of economic discards in fisheries under its jurisdiction if such economic discards, or the mortality of such economic discards, cannot be avoided. The report shall address the projected impacts of such requirements on participants in the fishery and describe any full retention and full utilization requirements that have been implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The report shall address the advisability of measures to minimize processing waste, including standards setting minimum percentages which must be processed for human consumption. For the purpose of the report, &ldquo;processing waste&rdquo; means that portion of any fish which is processed and which could be used for human consumption or other commercial use, but which is not so used.</p>
