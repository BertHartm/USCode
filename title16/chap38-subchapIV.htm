<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any fishery management plan prepared, and any regulation promulgated to implement any such plan, pursuant to this subchapter shall be consistent with the following national standards for fishery conservation and management:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the United States fishing industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Conservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the extent practicable, an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Conservation and management measures shall not discriminate between residents of different States. If it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various United States fishermen, such allocation shall be (A) fair and equitable to all such fishermen; (B) reasonably calculated to promote conservation; and (C) carried out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, promote efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources; except that no such measure shall have economic allocation as its sole purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Conservation and management measures shall take into account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, fishery resources, and catches.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish advisory guidelines (which shall not have the force and effect of law), based on the national standards, to assist in the development of fishery management plans.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River Basin: Striped Bass Study</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;589, &sect;5, Nov. 3, 1988, 102 Stat. 2984, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The anadromous stock of striped bass in the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River Basin area of North Carolina sustained important commercial and recreational fisheries as recently as the 1960's and 1970's.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) This stock has been declining for some time and is severely depressed at present, and may soon reach a level from which recovery will be exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The reasons for this decline are thought to include fishing; other human activities and environmental factors, such as unsuitable water flow before, during, and after critical spawning periods; degradation of water quality by pollutants; the impact of eutrophication on the food chain, and the impact of changing land use activities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Current Federal and interstate efforts to conserve the Atlantic striped bass, while effective in identifying factors contributing to the decline of other important Atlantic coastal migratory stocks of striped bass and steps that will be effective in reversing that decline, have not made a major contribution to the protection and restoration of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock of striped bass.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Because the striped bass and the aquatic environment of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin presently are being significantly affected by combined but not fully understood causes, a study should be undertaken to obtain additional biological information to understand the significance of fishing, water flows, and other factors in the decline of the striped bass populations in the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin and, if feasible, develop an effective course of action for restoring these important stocks of striped bass.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Study.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in consultation with the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) immediately undertake a biological study of the striped bass fishery resources and habitats of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin area;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) develop short-term and long-term recommendations for Federal and State government <!-- PDFPage:1588 -->agencies for restoring and conserving such resources and habitats; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) submit the results of such study and such recommendations to the Congress and to the States of North Carolina and Virginia as soon as practicable, but not later than 36 months after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 3, 1988].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents of the study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The study conducted under this subsection shall, to the extent existing data are adequate, use such existing data and shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) a description of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin area, and an investigation and analysis of the effects of land and water use practices on the striped bass population and habitats of the area;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) an investigation and analysis of the abundance and age and geographic distribution of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock of striped bass, including the amount and geographical location of migration and spawning habitat;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) an investigation and analysis of factors that may affect the abundance and age and geographic distribution of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock of striped bass, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) the extent and causes of mortality at successive stages in the life cycle of striped bass, including mortality due to recreational and commercial fishing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) the combined effects of pollution and other natural and human alterations of the physical environment, including the effects of water withdrawals, discharges, and flows, on striped bass migration and spawning and on the viability and condition of eggs and larval fish;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) an investigation and analysis of the status and effectiveness of current striped bass management measures implemented by State and Federal authorities, including State fishing regulations and Federal fish stocking activities, reservoir management and water flow regulation, and an analysis of whether any additional State or Federal measures would be effective in halting the decline and initiating the recovery of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock of striped bass; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) a recommendation of whether conservation of the Albermarle [sic] Sound-Roanoke River stocks of striped bass could be improved by management of these stocks under the provisions of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for Striped Bass and the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act [Pub. L. 98&ndash;613, set out below].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Participation by State Agencies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Director of the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries, the Executive Director of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the Secretary of the Virginia Department of Natural Resources, and the District Engineer for the Wilmington District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers shall be invited to have their agencies participate in conducting the study and developing recommendations pursuant to subsection (b).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To facilitate participation by the agencies referred to in paragraph (1), should they decide to participate, a Memorandum of Understanding will be executed with such officials setting forth the respective responsibilities of the entities involved in conducting the study and developing those recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out the study under subsection (b), the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, other Federal agencies, the Albermarle-Pamlico [sic] Estuarine Study, Dominion Resources, Inc./Virginia Power/North Carolina Power, affected local governments in North Carolina and Virginia, appropriate commercial and recreational fishing interests, and other interests shall be consulted, to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is authorized to be appropriated the sum of $1,000,000 to carry out the requirements of this section. These appropriations will remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) <cap-smallcap>State Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing any State to manage fisheries within the jurisdiction of another State.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(g) <cap-smallcap>Restriction on Use of Other Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization contained in section 7(d) of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 757g(d)) shall not be used to carry out this section.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act [enacting this note and amending section 757g of this title] may be cited as the &lsquo;Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Atlantic striped bass are of historic commercial and recreational importance and economic benefit to the Atlantic coastal States and to the Nation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) As a consequence of increased fishing pressure, environmental pollution, the loss and alteration of habitat, and the inadequacy of fishery conservation and management practices and controls, certain stocks of Atlantic striped bass have been severely reduced in number.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1589 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Because no single government entity has full management authority throughout the range of the Atlantic striped bass, the harvesting and conservation of these fish have been subject to diverse, inconsistent, and intermittent State regulation that has been detrimental to the long-term maintenance of stocks of the species and to the interests of fishermen and the Nation as a whole.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It is in the national interest to implement effective procedures and measures to provide for effective interjurisdictional conservation and management of this species.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in this Act to support and encourage the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective interstate action regarding the conservation and management of the Atlantic striped bass.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 9 months after November 28, 1990, the Secretary shall, after consultation with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, establish by regulation a 3-year program to assess the impact on fishery resources of incidental harvest by the shrimp trawl fishery within the authority of such Councils.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The program established pursuant to paragraph (1) shall provide for the identification of stocks of fish which are subject to significant incidental harvest in the course of normal shrimp trawl fishing activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For stocks of fish identified pursuant to paragraph (2), with priority given to stocks which (based upon the best available scientific information) are considered to be overfished, the Secretary shall conduct&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a program to collect and evaluate data on the nature and extent (including the spatial and temporal distribution) of incidental mortality of such stocks as a direct result of shrimp trawl fishing activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an assessment of the status and condition of such stocks, including collection of information which would allow the estimation of life history parameters with sufficient accuracy and precision to support sound scientific evaluation of the effects of various management alternatives on the status of such stocks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a program of data collection and evaluation for such stocks on the magnitude and distribution of fishing mortality and fishing effort by sources of fishing mortality other than shrimp trawl fishing activity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall, in cooperation with affected interests, commence a program to design, and evaluate the efficacy of, technological devices and other changes in fishing technology for the reduction of incidental mortality of non<!-- PDFPage:1603 -->target fishery resources in the course of shrimp trawl fishing activity. Such program shall take into account local conditions and include evaluation of any reduction in incidental mortality, as well as any reduction or increase in the retention of shrimp in the course of normal fishing activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall, upon completion of the programs required by this subsection, submit a detailed report on the results of such programs to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Except as provided in this paragraph, the Secretary may not implement any measures under this chapter to reduce incidental mortality of nontarget fishery resources in the course of shrimp trawl fishing which would restrict the period during which shrimp are harvested or would require the use of any technological device or other change in fishing technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall cease on April 1, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) This paragraph does not apply to any law or regulation in effect on November 28, 1990, nor does it limit in any way the Secretary's authority to take action, including any limitation on entry permitted by this chapter, for the conservation and management of the shrimp fishery resource.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1858. Civil penalties and permit sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assessment of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have committed an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary, or his designee, by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review of civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review thereof in the United States district court for the appropriate district by filing a complaint in such court within 30 days from the date of such order and by simultaneously serving a copy of such complaint by certified mail on the Secretary, the Attorney General and the appropriate United States Attorney. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such penalty imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court if they are not found to be supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action upon failure to pay assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) In rem jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fishing vessel (including its fishing gear, furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used in the commission of an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title shall be liable in rem for any civil penalty assessed for such violation under this section and may be proceeded against in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof. Such penalty shall constitute a maritime lien on such vessel which may be recovered in an action in rem in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction over the vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Compromise or other action by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Subpenas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of conducting any hearing under this section, the Secretary may issue subpenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, and may administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt or refusal to obey a subpena served upon any person pursuant to this subsection, the district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business, upon application by the United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony before the Secretary or to appear and produce documents before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Permit sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which (A) a vessel has been used in the commission of an act prohibited <!-- PDFPage:1610 -->under section 1857 of this title, (B) the owner or operator of a vessel or any other person who has been issued or has applied for a permit under this chapter has acted in violation of section 1857 of this title, or (C) any civil penalty or criminal fine imposed on a vessel or owner or operator of a vessel or any other person who has been issued or has applied for a permit under any fishery resource law statute enforced by the Secretary has not been paid and is overdue, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) revoke any permit issued with respect to such vessel or person, with or without prejudice to the issuance of subsequent permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) suspend such permit for a period of time considered by the Secretary to be appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) deny such permit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) impose additional conditions and restrictions on any permit issued to or applied for by such vessel or person under this chapter and, with respect to foreign fishing vessels, on the approved application of the foreign nation involved and on any permit issued under that application.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In imposing a sanction under this subsection, the Secretary shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts for which the sanction is imposed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Transfer of ownership of a vessel, by sale or otherwise, shall not extinguish any permit sanction that is in effect or is pending at the time of transfer of ownership. Before executing the transfer of ownership of a vessel, by sale or otherwise, the owner shall disclose in writing to the prospective transferee the existence of any permit sanction that will be in effect or pending with respect to the vessel at the time of the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of any permit that is suspended under this subsection for nonpayment of a civil penalty or criminal fine, the Secretary shall reinstate the permit upon payment of the penalty or fine and interest thereon at the prevailing rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No sanctions shall be imposed under this subsection unless there has been a prior opportunity for a hearing on the facts underlying the violation for which the sanction is imposed, either in conjunction with a civil penalty proceeding under this section or otherwise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any fishing vessel (including its fishing gear, furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used, and any fish (or the fair market value thereof) taken or retained, in any manner, in connection with or as a result of the commission of any act prohibited by section 1857 of this title (other than any act for which the issuance of a citation under section 1861(c) of this title is sufficient sanction) shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States. All or part of such vessel may, and all such fish (or the fair market value thereof) shall, be forfeited to the United States pursuant to a civil proceeding under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Jurisdiction of district courts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any district court of the United States which has jurisdiction under section 1861(d) of this title shall have jurisdiction, upon application by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States, to order any forfeiture authorized under subsection (a) of this section and any action provided for under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judgment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a judgment is entered for the United States in a civil forfeiture proceeding under this section, the Attorney General may seize any property or other interest declared forfeited to the United States, which has not previously been seized pursuant to this chapter or for which security has not previously been obtained under subsection (d) of this section. The provisions of the customs laws relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the seizure, forfeiture, and condemnation of property for violation of the customs law;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedure</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-block">upon the receipt of a satisfactory bond or other security from any person claiming such property. Such bond or other security shall be conditioned upon such person (i) delivering such property to the appropriate court upon order thereof, without any impairment of its value, or (ii) paying the monetary value of such property pursuant to an order of such court. Judgment shall be recoverable on such bond or other security against both the principal and any sureties in the event that any condition thereof is breached, as determined by such court.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the availability of comprehensive commercial insurance for vessel and owner liability against civil suits by observers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
