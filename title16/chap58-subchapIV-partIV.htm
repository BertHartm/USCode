<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the environmental quality incentives program established by this part are to promote agricultural production and environmental quality as compatible goals, and to optimize environmental benefits, by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assisting producers in complying with local, State, and national regulatory requirements concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) soil, water, and air quality;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) avoiding, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for resource and regulatory programs by assisting producers in protecting soil, water, air, and related natural resources and meeting environmental quality criteria established by Federal, State, tribal, and local agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) providing flexible assistance to producers to install and maintain conservation practices that enhance soil, water, related natural resources (including grazing land and wetland), and wildlife while sustaining production of food and fiber;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2130 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) assisting producers to make beneficial, cost effective changes to cropping systems, grazing management, nutrient management associated with livestock, pest or irrigation management, or other practices on agricultural land; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) consolidating and streamlining conservation planning and regulatory compliance processes to reduce administrative burdens on producers and the cost of achieving environmental goals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed 10 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Bidding down</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that the environmental values of 2 or more applications for cost-share payments or incentive payments are comparable, the Secretary shall not assign a higher priority to the application only because it would present the least cost to the program established under the program.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer shall not be eligible for cost-share payments for practices on eligible land under the program if the producer receives cost-share payments or other benefits for the same practice on the same land under part I of this subchapter and the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Incentive payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make incentive payments in an amount and at a rate determined by the Secretary to be necessary to encourage a producer to perform 1 or more land management practices.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount and rate of incentive payments, the Secretary may accord great significance to a practice that promotes residue, nutrient, pest, invasive species, or air quality management.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Voluntary modification or termination</h4>
