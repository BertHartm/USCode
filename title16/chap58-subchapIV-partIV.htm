L. 107&ndash;171, title II, &sect;2301, May 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 253, because of the extensive revision of the chapter's provisions by Pub. L. 107&ndash;171. Such revision did not contain a chapter heading, which was subsequently added by Pub. L. 110&ndash;234, title II, &sect;2501(b), May 22, 2008, 122 Stat. 1058, and Pub.
