<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the commercial use, if any, to be permitted on the land during such term; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may provide for the permanent retirement of any existing cropland base and allotment history for the land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Environmental use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent practicable, not less than one-eighth of land that is placed in the conservation reserve under this subpart during the 1991 through 2002 calendar years shall be devoted to trees, or devoted to shrubs or other noncrop vegetation or water that may provide a permanent habitat for wildlife including migratory waterfowl.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alley cropping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may permit alley cropping of agricultural commodities on land that is subject to contracts entered into under this subpart, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such agricultural commodities will be produced in conjunction with, and in close proximity to, such hardwood trees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the owner or operator of such land agrees to implement appropriate conservation practices concerning such land.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall develop a bid system by which owners and operators may offer to reduce their annual rental payments in exchange for permission to produce agricultural commodities on such land in accordance with this subsection. The Secretary shall not accept offers under this paragraph that provide for less than a 50 percent reduction in such annual payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall ensure that the total annual rental payments over the term of any contract modified under this subsection are not in excess of that specified in the original contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;alley cropping&rdquo; means the practice of planting rows of trees bordered on each side by a narrow strip of groundcover, alternated with wider strips of row crops or grain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner or operator who is a party to a contract entered into under this subpart may not be required to make repayments to the Secretary of amounts received under such contract if the land that is subject to such contract has been foreclosed upon and the Secretary determines that forgiving such repayments is appropriate in order to provide fair and equitable treatment. This subsection shall not void the responsibilities of such an owner or operator under the contract if such owner or operator resumes control over the property that is subject to the contract within the period specified in the contract. Upon the resumption of such control over the property by the owner or operator, the provisions of the contract in effect on the date of the foreclosure shall apply.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enrolling land in the wetland reserve established under this subpart during the 1991 through 2002 calendar years, land shall be eligible to be placed into such reserve if the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior at the local level, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such land is farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with adjacent lands that are functionally dependent on such wetlands, except that converted wetlands where the conversion was not commenced prior to December 23, 1985, shall not be eligible to be enrolled in the program under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the program taking into consideration the cost of such restoration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other eligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the wetland reserve established under this subpart, together with land that is eligible under subsection (c) of this section, land that maximizes wildlife benefits and that is&mdash;</p>
