<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Coastal fishery resources that migrate, or are widely distributed, across the jurisdictional boundaries of two or more of the Atlantic States and of the Federal Government are of substantial commercial and recreational importance and economic benefit to the Atlantic coastal region and the Nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Increased fishing pressure, environmental pollution, and the loss and alteration of habitat have reduced severely certain Atlantic coastal fishery resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Because no single governmental entity has exclusive management authority for Atlantic coastal fishery resources, harvesting of such resources in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5101_1_target" name="5101_1">1</a></sup> frequently subject to disparate, inconsistent, and intermittent State and Federal regulation that has been detrimental to the conservation and sustainable use of such resources and to the interests of fishermen and the Nation as a whole.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The responsibility for managing Atlantic coastal fisheries rests with the States, which carry out a cooperative program of fishery oversight and management through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to support such cooperative interstate management of coastal fishery resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The failure by one or more Atlantic States to fully implement a coastal fishery management plan can affect the status of Atlantic coastal fisheries, and can discourage other States from fully implementing coastal fishery management plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) It is in the national interest to provide for more effective Atlantic State fishery resource conservation and management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this chapter is to support and encourage the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective interstate conservation and management of Atlantic coastal fishery resources.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Coastal fishery management plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall prepare and adopt coastal fishery management plans to provide for the conservation of coastal fishery resources. In preparing a coastal fishery management plan for a fishery that is located in both State waters and the exclusive economic zone, the Commission shall consult with appropriate Councils to determine areas where such coastal fishery management plan may complement Council fishery management plans. The coastal fishery management plan shall specify the requirements necessary for States to be in compliance with the plan. Upon adoption of a coastal fishery management plan, the Commission shall identify each State that is required to implement and enforce that plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 1 year after December 20, 1993, the Commission shall establish standards and procedures to govern the preparation of coastal fishery management plans under this chapter, including standards and procedures to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1882 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such plans promote the conservation of fish stocks throughout their ranges and are based on the best scientific information available; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Commission provides adequate opportunity for public participation in the plan preparation process, including at least four public hearings and procedures for the submission of written comments to the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each State identified under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a coastal fishery management plan shall implement and enforce the measures of such plan within the timeframe established in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 90 days after December 20, 1993, the Commission shall establish a schedule of timeframes within which States shall implement and enforce the measures of coastal fishery management plans in existence before December 20, 1993. No such timeframe shall exceed 12 months after the date on which the schedule is adopted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Commission monitoring of State implementation and enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, at least annually, review each State's implementation and enforcement of coastal fishery management plans for the purpose of determining whether such State is effectively implementing and enforcing each such plan. Upon completion of such reviews, the Commission shall report the results of the reviews to the Secretaries.</p>

The Secretary shall specify the moratorium's effective date, which shall be any date within 6 months after declaration of the moratorium.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If after a moratorium is declared under paragraph (1) the Secretary is notified by the Commission that the Commission is withdrawing under section 5105(c) of this title the determination of noncompliance, the Secretary shall immediately determine whether the State is in compliance with the applicable plan.
