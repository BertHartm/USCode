<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Pinelands area in New Jersey, containing approximately 1,000,000 acres of pine-oak forest, extensive surface and ground water resources of high quality, and a wide diversity of rare plant and animal species, provides significant ecological, natural, cultural, recreational, educational, agricultural, and public health benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a national interest in protecting and preserving these benefits for the residents of and visitors to the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a primary responsibility for protecting and enhancing these benefits resides with the State of New Jersey and the various local units of government having jurisdiction over the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in view of the longstanding Federal practice of assisting the States in creating, pro<!-- PDFPage:748 -->tecting, preserving, and enhancing areas of significant regional and urban importance, and in view of the national significance of this resource, the Federal Government has an interest in assisting the State of New Jersey and its local units of government in fulfilling their responsibilities and in avoiding adverse Federally approved or assisted impacts before these responsibilities can be undertaken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the State of New Jersey and its local units of government have authority to prevent or minimize adverse uses of the land and water resources of the Pinelands area and can, to a great extent, protect the health, safety, and general welfare by the use of such authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is a demonstrated need to protect, preserve and enhance the land and water resources of the Pinelands area through a new program which combines the capabilities and resources of the local, State and Federal governments and the private sector and provides an alternative to large-scale direct Federal acquisition and management in cases where such acquisition and management is inappropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to protect, preserve and enhance the significant values of the land and water resources of the Pinelands area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage and assist the State of New Jersey and its units of local government in the development of a comprehensive management plan for the Pinelands area in order to assure orderly public and private development in the area consistent with the findings of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide, during the development of this comprehensive plan, Federal financial assistance for the acquisition of lands in the Pinelands area that have critical ecological values which are in immediate danger of being adversely affected or destroyed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to encourage and assist the State and its units of local government in developing a governmental mechanism to implement this comprehensive plan, and to provide Federal financial assistance for the acquisition of lands consistent with the comprehensive plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to encourage adequate coordination of all government programs affecting the land and water resources of the Pinelands area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Pinelands National Reserve and Federal Project Review Area; establishment; map, availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established the Pinelands National Reserve which shall consist of the approximately 1,000,000-acre area generally depicted on the map entitled &ldquo;Pinelands National Reserve Boundary Map&rdquo; numbered NPS/80,011A and dated September 1978. Within the Pinelands National Reserve, there is hereby established the Federal Project Review Area, which shall consist of the approximately 486,000 acre area also depicted on the map. The map shall be on file and available for public inspection in the offices of the Department of the Interior in Washington, and in the offices of the State of New Jersey planning entity established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and in locations throughout the Pinelands National Reserve as determined by the planning entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State planning entity for development of comprehensive management plan; membership; representation of interests; assistance and grants to State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within thirty days after November 10, 1978, the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall request the Governor of the State of New Jersey to establish, within ninety days of such request, a planning entity to develop a comprehensive management plan for the Pinelands National Reserve. In order to carry out the purposes of this section, such planning entity shall be composed of fifteen members to be appointed as follows: one member appointed by the Secretary; one member from each of the seven counties in the Pinelands National Reserve to be appointed by the respective governing bodies of each county; and seven members to be appointed by the Governor. The membership of the planning entity shall include residents of the Pinelands National Reserve who represent economic activities such as agriculture in the area, as well as residents of New Jersey who represent conservation interests. The Secretary shall provide technical assistance and grants to the State for the development of the plan or revisions thereof: <em>Provided</em>, That such grants shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of developing the plan, shall be made only upon application of the Governor, on behalf of the planning entity, and shall be subject to such other conditions as the Secretary may deem appropriate to assure State and local interim protection of the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Planning entity consultations; public hearings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the development of the management plan, the planning entity shall:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consult with appropriate officials of any local government or State or Federal agency which has jurisdiction over lands and waters within the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with the officials of any local government which has jurisdiction over lands and waters within areas delineated in accordance with subsection (f)(2)(B) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consult with interested professional, scientific and citizen organizations;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in order to protect certain outstanding examples of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees located in the North and South Calaveras Groves, on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the State of California has established the Calaveras Big Trees State Park;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) for similar purposes, the United States has designated certain adjacent Federal lands, amounting to approximately 379 acres, as the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) this National Forest (managed as part of the Stanislaus National Forest) is the smallest National Forest in the United States and could be more appropriately and efficiently managed as part of the Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this Act is to improve the management of the lands located in the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest, and to protect certain examples of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees, by unifying the management of the lands in such National Forest and in the California Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. LAND CONVEYANCE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Conveyance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to valid existing rights and the provisions of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary&rsquo;) is authorized and directed to convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to lands and interests therein within the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest, as generally depicted on a map numbered 20435 and dated June 5, 1989, prepared by the California Department of Parks and Recreation, to the State of California for inclusion within the Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Map and Description</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As soon as practicable after the enactment of this Act [Oct. 17, 1990], the Secretary shall submit a map and legal description of the lands referred to in subsection (a) to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs [now Committee on Natural Resources] of the United States House of Representatives, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The conveyance shall take place only if within two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 17, 1990], there is concluded an agreement between the State of California and the Secretary whereby the State of California agrees to provide to the United States, in exchange for the lands described in subsection (a) and pursuant to terms and conditions which the Secretary finds acceptable, consideration of approximately equal value. Such consideration shall include either lands in California that the Secretary finds suitable for addition to, and are contiguous to, one or more units of the National Forest System, cash payment, or monetary grants awarded to the United States after June 1, 1990, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) No harvest of timber (except as may be necessary for the control of fire, insects, or disease) and no mining, mineral leasing, or geothermal exploration or development shall be permitted on such lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Any action by the State of California to convey any portion of such lands or interests to any entity other than the United States shall be void ab initio and shall result in the reversion to the United States of all right, title, and interest in such lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Any action by the State of California to permit the use of any portion of such lands for any purpose prohibited by this subsection or any purpose incompatible with the continued ability of such lands to support ponderosa pine, sugar pine, or giant sequoia trees, shall result in the reversion of all right, title, and interest in such lands to the United States. Any such lands which revert to the United States shall be incorporated into the Stanislaus National Forest and managed to preserve and protect the stands of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees located on such lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Secretary, acting through the Forest Service, shall be afforded by appropriate officials of the State of California reasonable opportunities to col<!-- PDFPage:771 -->lect seeds from trees located on such lands for scientific or silvicultural purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Secretary, upon prior notification to the State of California, shall be entitled at any time to enter upon such lands for the purpose of monitoring the management of such lands and the compliance of the State of California with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The conveyance shall be subject to the following reservations or exceptions:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) existing ditches and canals as authorized by the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945); and</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the request of the Secretary, the Attorney General shall bring any action or take any other steps necessary to enforce the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Timing, Value, and Status</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Conveyance of lands to the State of California pursuant to this Act shall occur when the agreement described in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) has been reached. The restrictions and conditions specified in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) of subsection (c) shall be included in the instruments of conveyance of lands to the State of California.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Effective upon the conveyance to the State of California of lands described in subsection (a) of this section, or two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 17, 1990], whichever is sooner, the National Forest designation of such lands shall terminate. Any such lands not conveyed to the State of California shall thereupon be incorporated into the Stanislaus National Forest and managed to preserve and protect the stands of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees located on such lands.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Any lands conveyed to the United States pursuant to this Act shall be deemed national forest lands and managed according to the laws governing the management of the National Forest System.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo;) is authorized to issue permits (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;ski area permits&rdquo;) for the use and occupancy of suitable lands within the National Forest System for nordic and alpine skiing operations and purposes. A ski area permit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may be issued for a term not to exceed 40 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall ordinarily be issued for a term of 40 years (unless the Secretary determines that the facilities or operations are of a scale or nature as are not likely to require long-term financing or operation), or that there are public policy reasons specific to a particular permit for a shorter term;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall encompass such acreage as the Secretary determines sufficient and appropriate to accommodate the permittee's needs for ski operations and appropriate ancillary facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may be renewed at the discretion of the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) may be cancelled by the Secretary in whole or in part for any violation of the permit terms or conditions, for nonpayment of permit fees, or upon the determination by the Secretary in his planning for the uses of the national forests that the permitted area is needed for higher public purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) may be modified from time to time by the Secretary to accommodate changes in plans or operations in accordance with the provisions of applicable law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) shall be subject to such reasonable terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) shall be subject to a permit fee based on fair market value in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Construction with Secretary's duties under other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be deemed to amend, modify or otherwise affect the Secretary's duties under the National Environmental Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.], or the Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act [16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.] as amended by the National Forest Management Act, includ<!-- PDFPage:773 -->ing his duties to involve the public in his decisionmaking and planning for the national forests.</p>

The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the State, shall assess the effects on the populations of such fish in determinations made pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approved plan for mining operations; requirements; review; modification; suspension of activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Because of the large scale of contemplated mining operations and the proximity of such operations to important fishery resources, with respect to mining operations in the Quartz Hill area of the Tongass National Forest, the regulations of the Secretary shall, pursuant to this subsection, include a requirement that all mining operations involving significant surface disturbance shall be in accordance with an approved plan of operations. Before approving any proposed plan or distinct stages of such plan of operations for any such claims when any fishery habitat or fishery value may be affected, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior and the State of Alaska, determine&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary shall review such plan and mining activities on at least an annual basis. With respect to any mining or associated activities, the Secretary, if he determines upon notice and hearing, that the activities are harmful to the continued productivity of anadromous fish, or other foodfish populations or fishery habitat, shall require a modification of the plan to eliminate or mitigate, if necessary, the harmful effects of such activities; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insured and guaranteed loan program for purchasers of national forests materials in Alaska; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized and directed to establish a special program of insured or guaranteed loans to purchasers of national forest materials in Alaska to assist such purchasers in the acquisition of equipment and the implementation of new technologies which lead to the utilization of wood products which might otherwise not be utilized. The Secretary is authorized to promulgate such regulations as he deems appropriate to define eligibility requirements for the participation in the loan program and the terms and conditions applicable to loans made under the program. Except as otherwise provided in this section or regulations promulgated specifically for this loan program, such program shall be carried out in a manner which is consistent with other authorities available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To carry out the special loan program established by this section, there are hereby authorized beginning after the fiscal year 1980 to be appropriated $5,000,000 from National Forest Fund receipts, to be deposited in a special fund in the Treasury of the United States to remain available until expended. Repayments of principal and interest and other recoveries on loans authorized by this section shall be credited to this fund and shall remain available until expended in order to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Study on increase of timber yields on national forest lands in Alaska; transmittal to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within three years after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall prepare and transmit to the Senate and House of Representatives a study of opportunities (consistent with the laws and regulations applicable to the management of the National Forest System) to increase timber yields on national forest lands in Alaska.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Identification of lands not suited for timber production; consideration of economic factors unnecessary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All provisions of section 6(k) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. <!-- PDFPage:791 -->1604(k)) shall apply to the Tongass National Forest except that the Secretary need not consider economic factors in the identification of lands not suited for timber production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Protection of riparian habitat; maintenance of buffer zones in Tongass National Forest; relocation of prior independent sale or released volume</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure protection of riparian habitat, the Secretary shall maintain a buffer zone of no less than one hundred feet in width on each side of all Class I streams in the Tongass National Forest, and on those Class II streams which flow directly into a Class I stream, within which commercial timber harvesting shall be prohibited, except where independent national forest timber sales have already been sold prior to March 1, 1990, or where volume has been released prior to March 1, 1990, to either the Alaska Pulp Corporation or the Ketchikan Pulp Company pursuant to the long-term timber sale contracts numbered 12&ndash;11&ndash;010&ndash;1545 and A10fs&ndash;1042 respectively. If such an independent timber sale or released volume is within the buffer zone, the Secretary shall make every effort to relocate such independent sale or released volume to an area outside of the buffer zone. The Secretary shall use best management practices, as defined in the Region 10 Soil and Water Conservation handbook&nbsp;<sup><a href="#539d_1_target" name="539d_1">1</a></sup> (FSH 2509.22), January 1990, to assure the protection of riparian habitat on streams or portions of streams not protected by such buffer zones.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal lands may be used for the construction of any dam or diversion within the boundaries of the special management area without specific authority of the Congress. In order to protect the natural, cultural, recreational, fishery, and wildlife values of the river segment referred to in this subsection, that segment shall be subject to the provisions of section 1278(a) of this title, in the same manner as if it were designated. Nothing in this Act shall preclude the Kings River Conservation District from conducting studies as it may deem appropriate.</p>
