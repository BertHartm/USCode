<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean has resulted in the deaths of millions of dolphins.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Significant awareness and increased concern for the health and safety of dolphin populations has encouraged a change in fishing methods worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) United States tuna fishing vessels have led the world in the development of fishing methods to reduce dolphin mortalities in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and United States tuna processing companies have voluntarily promoted the marketing of tuna that is dolphin safe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nations harvesting yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have indicated their willingness to participate in appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce, and eventually eliminate, dolphin mortality in that fishery.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) eliminate the marine mammal mortality resulting from the intentional encirclement of dolphins and other marine mammals in tuna purse seine fisheries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) secure appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce, and eventually eliminate, the mortality referred to in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that the market of the United States does not act as an incentive to the harvest of tuna caught in association with dolphins or with driftnets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) secure appropriate multilateral agreements to ensure that United States tuna fishing vessels shall have continued access to productive tuna fishing grounds in the South Pacific Ocean and elsewhere; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) encourage observer coverage on purse seine vessels fishing for tuna outside of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean in a fishery in which the Secretary has determined that a regular and significant association occurs between marine mammals and tuna, and in which tuna is harvested through the use of purse seine nets deployed on or to encircle marine mammals.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, conduct a study of the effect of intentional encirclement (including chase) on dolphins and dolphin stocks incidentally taken in the course of purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The study, which shall commence on October 1, 1997, shall consist of abundance surveys as described in paragraph (2) and stress studies as described in paragraph (3), and shall address the question of whether such encirclement is having a significant adverse impact on any depleted dolphin stock in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Population abundance surveys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The abundance surveys under this subsection shall survey the abundance of such depleted stocks and shall be conducted during each of the calendar years 1998, 1999, and 2000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stress studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The stress studies under this subsection shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a review of relevant stress-related research and a 3-year series of necropsy samples from dolphins obtained by commercial vessels;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an experiment involving the repeated chasing and capturing of dolphins by means of intentional encirclement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No later than 90 days after publishing the finding under subsection (g)(2) of section 1385 of this title, the Secretary shall complete and submit a report containing the results of the research described in this subsection to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the United States House of Representatives Committees on Resources and on Commerce, and to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other research</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to conducting the research described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and in cooperation with the nations participating in the International Dolphin Conservation Program and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, undertake or support appropriate scientific research to further the goals of the International Dolphin Conservation Program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specific areas of research</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Research carried out under paragraph (1) may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) projects to devise cost-effective fishing methods and gear so as to reduce, with the goal of eliminating, the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in connection with commercial purse seine fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) projects to develop cost-effective methods of fishing for mature yellowfin tuna without setting nets on dolphins or other marine mammals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) projects to carry out stock assessments for those marine mammal species and marine mammal stocks taken in the purse seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, including species or stocks not within waters under the jurisdiction of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) projects to determine the extent to which the incidental take of nontarget spe<!-- PDFPage:1525 -->cies, including juvenile tuna, occurs in the course of purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, the geographic location of the incidental take, and the impact of that incidental take on tuna stocks and nontarget species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary the following amounts, to be used by the Secretary to carry out the research described in subsection (a) of this section:</p>
