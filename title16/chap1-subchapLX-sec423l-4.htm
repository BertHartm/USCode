In acquiring lands and interests in lands under sections 423<em>l</em>&ndash;1 to 423<em>l</em>&ndash;6 of this title, the Secretary shall acquire the minimum interest necessary to achieve the purposes for which the battlefield is established.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for private lands</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Outside boundaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may acquire an easement on property outside the boundaries of the battlefield park and around the City of Richmond, with the consent of the owner, if the Secretary determines that the easement is necessary to protect core Civil War resources as identified by the Civil War Sites Advisory Committee. Upon acquisition of the easement, the Secretary shall revise the boundaries of the battlefield park to include the property subject to the easement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inside boundaries</h4>
