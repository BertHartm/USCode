<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The stocks of salmon and steelhead which originate in the rivers of the conservation areas constitute valuable and renewable natural resources. Many groups of commercial, recreational, and treaty fishermen have historically depended upon these stocks of fish for their livelihoods and avocations. These fishery resources contribute to the food supply and economic health of the Pacific Northwest and the Nation as a whole, provide valuable recreational experiences for thousands of citizens from various parts of the United States and represent a central element of the cultures and economies of Indian tribes and the citizens of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Over a period of several decades, competing uses of salmon and steelhead habitat and historical problems relating to conservation measures, the regulation of harvest and enhancement have depressed several of these stocks of salmon and steelhead.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Improved management and enhancement planning and coordination among salmon and steelhead managers will help prevent a further decline of salmon and steelhead stocks and will assist in increasing the supply of these stocks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Due in principal part to the Federal court decisions in the United States against Washington and Sohappy against Smith, the fishing capacity of nontreaty fishermen in the conservation areas established by this chapter exceeds that required to harvest the available salmon resources. This excess capacity causes severe economic problems for these fishermen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The supply of salmon and steelhead can be increased through carefully planned enhancement measures designed to improve the survival of stocks and to augment the production of artificially propagated stocks. By careful choice of species, areas, and stocking procedures, enhancement programs can be used to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) improve the distribution of fish among different groups of treaty and nontreaty fishermen; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) add stability to the treaty and nontreaty fisheries by reducing variations in fish availability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In order to assist the harvesters of the salmon and steelhead resources within the Columbia River conservation area and the Washington conservation area established by this chapter to overcome temporary dislocations arising from the decisions in the cases of United States against Washington and Sohappy against Smith and from other causes, this chapter authorizes the establishment of a cooperative program involving the United States, the States of Washington and Oregon, the treaty tribes acting through the appropriate tribal coordinating bodies, and other parties, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) encourage stability in and promote the economic well being of the treaty and nontreaty commercial fishing and charter fishing industries and improve the distribution of fishing power between treaty and nontreaty fisheries through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the purchase of nontreaty commercial and charter fishing vessels, gear, and licenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) coordinated research, enhancement, and management of salmon and steelhead resources and habitat; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve the quality of, and maintain the opportunities for, salmon and steelhead recreational fishing.</p>
