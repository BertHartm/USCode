<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall carry out a comprehensive program to inventory, monitor, characterize, assess, and identify forest stands (with emphasis on hardwood forest stands) and potential forest stands&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in units of the National Forest System (other than those units created from the public domain); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) on private forest land, with the consent of the owner of the land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issues to be addressed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall address issues including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) early detection, identification, and assessment of environmental threats (including insect, disease, invasive species, fire, and weather-related risks and other episodic events);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) loss or degradation of forests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) degradation of the quality forest stands caused by inadequate forest regeneration practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) quantification of carbon uptake rates; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Early warning system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall develop a comprehensive early warning system for potential catastrophic environmental threats to forests to increase the likelihood that forest managers will be able to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) isolate and treat a threat before the threat gets out of control; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prevent epidemics, such as the American chestnut blight in the first half of the twentieth century, that could be environmentally and economically devastating to forests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
