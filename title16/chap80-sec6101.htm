<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the United States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and the large majority of those species, the neotropical migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in jeopardy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations of those species is habitat loss and degradation (including pollution and contamination) across the species&rsquo; range; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across numerous international borders each year, their conservation requires the commitment and effort of all countries along their migration routes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve migratory birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be significantly strengthened and enhanced by increased coordination.</p>
