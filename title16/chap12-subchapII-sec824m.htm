<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">No rate or charge received by an exempt wholesale generator for the sale of electric energy shall be lawful under section 824d of this title if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that such rate or charge results from the receipt of any undue preference or advantage from an electric utility which is an associate company or an affiliate of the exempt wholesale generator. For purposes of this section, the terms &ldquo;associate company&rdquo; and &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as provided in section 16451 of title 42.<sup><a href="#824m_1_target" name="824m_1">1</a></sup></p>

<h4 class="note-head">References in Text</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 16451 of title 42, referred to in text, was in the original &ldquo;section 2(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005&rdquo; and was translated as reading &ldquo;section 1262&rdquo; of that Act, meaning section 1262 of subtitle F of title XII of Pub. L. 109&ndash;58, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because subtitle F of title XII of Pub. L. 109&ndash;58 does not contain a section 2 and section 1262 of subtitle F of title XII of Pub. L. 109&ndash;58 defines terms.</p>
