In addition, the Secretary is hereby authorized to purchase easements for a term of not less than 50 years to promote said purpose of this chapter, including the sound use and management of flood plains, shore lands, and aquatic areas of the Nation. Such contracts shall be designed to assist farm, ranch, wetland, and nonindustrial private forest owners and operators, or other owners or operators, to make, in orderly progression over a period of years, such changes, if any, as are needed to effectuate any of the purposes specified in clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), and (6) of section 590g(a) of this title; section 590p(b) of this title; the Water Bank Act; in enlarging fish and wildlife and recreation sources; in improving the level of management of nonindustrial private forest lands; and in providing long-term wildlife and upland game cover. In carrying out the provisions of this chapter, due regard shall be given to the maintenance of a continuing and stable supply of agricultural commodities and forest products adequate to meet consumer demand at prices fair to both producers and consumers.</p>
