<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a wetlands reserve program to assist owners of eligible lands in restoring and protecting wetlands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enrollment conditions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maximum enrollment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total number of acres enrolled in the wetlands reserve program shall not exceed 975,000 acres.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Methods of enrollment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), effective beginning October 1, 1996, to the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall enroll into the wetlands reserve program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 1/3 of the acres through the use of permanent easements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 1/3 of the acres through the use of 30-year easements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) 1/3 of the acres through the use of restoration cost-share agreements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Temporary easements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Effective beginning October 1, 1996, the Secretary shall not enroll acres in the wetlands reserve program through the use of new permanent easements until the Secretary has enrolled at least 75,000 acres in the program through the use of temporary easements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), to the maximum extent practicable should be interpreted to mean that acceptance of wetlands reserve program bids may be in proportion to landowner interest expressed in program options.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enrolling land in the wetland reserve established under this subpart during the 1991 through 2002 calendar years, land shall be eligible to be placed into such reserve if the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior at the local level, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such land is farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with adjacent lands that are functionally dependent on such wetlands, except that converted wetlands where the conversion was not commenced prior to December 23, 1985, shall not be eligible to be enrolled in the program under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the program taking into consideration the cost of such restoration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other eligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the wetland reserve established under this subpart, together with land that is eligible under subsection (c) of this section, land that maximizes wildlife benefits and that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) farmed wetland and adjoining lands, enrolled in the conservation reserve, with the highest wetland functions and values, and that are likely to return to production after they leave the conservation reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) other wetland of an owner that would not otherwise be eligible if the Secretary determines that the inclusion of such wetland in such easement would significantly add to the functional value of the easement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) riparian areas that link wetlands that are protected by easements or some other device or circumstance that achieves the same purpose as an easement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Ineligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not acquire easements on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) land that contains timber stands established under the conservation reserve under subpart B; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination of existing contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may terminate or modify an existing contract entered into under section 3831(a) of this title if eligible land that is subject to such contract is transferred into the program established by this subpart.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall enroll lands in the wetland reserve through the purchase of easements as provided for in section 3837a of this title.</p>
