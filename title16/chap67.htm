<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the discharge of untreated water in the ballast tanks of vessels and through other means results in unintentional introductions of nonindigenous species to fresh, brackish, and saltwater environments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when environmental conditions are favorable, nonindigenous species, such as the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), become established and may disrupt the aquatic environment and economy of affected coastal areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the zebra mussel was unintentionally introduced into the Great Lakes and, if left uncontrolled, is expected to infest over two-thirds of the continental United States through the unintentional transportation of larvae and adults by vessels operating in inland waters; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the potential economic disruption to communities affected by the zebra mussel due to its colonization of water pipes, boat hulls and other hard surfaces has been estimated at $5,000,000,000 by the year 2000, and the potential disruption to the diversity and abundance of native fish and other species could be severe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to prevent unintentional introduction and dispersal of nonindigenous species into waters of the United States through ballast water management and other requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to coordinate federally conducted, funded or authorized research, prevention&nbsp;<sup><a href="#4701_1_target" name="4701_1">1</a></sup> control, information dissemination and other activities regarding the zebra mussel and other aquatic nuisance species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to develop and carry out environmentally sound control methods to prevent, monitor and control unintentional introductions of nonindigenous species from pathways other than ballast water exchange;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to understand and minimize economic and ecological impacts of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species that become established, including the zebra mussel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish a program of research and technology development and assistance to States in the management and removal of zebra mussels.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) develop a demonstration program of prevention, monitoring, control, education and research for the zebra mussel, to be implemented in the Great Lakes and any other waters infested, or likely to become infested in the near future, by the zebra mussel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prevention</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Task Force shall establish and implement measures, within the program developed under subsection (a) of this section, to minimize the risk of introduction of aquatic nuisance species to waters of the United States, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identification of pathways by which aquatic organisms are introduced to waters of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) assessment of the risk that an aquatic organism carried by an identified pathway may become an aquatic nuisance species; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) evaluation of whether measures to prevent introductions of aquatic nuisance species are effective and environmentally sound.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Task Force determines that there is a substantial risk of unintentional introduction of an aquatic nuisance species by an identified pathway and that the adverse consequences of such an introduction are likely to be substantial, the Task Force shall, acting through the appropriate Federal agency, and after an opportunity for public comment, carry out cooperative, environmentally sound efforts with regional, State and local entities to minimize the risk of such an introduction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Task Force shall establish and implement monitoring measures, within the program developed under subsection (a) of this section, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) detect unintentional introductions of aquatic nuisance species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) determine the dispersal of aquatic nuisance species after introduction; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Control</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Task Force may develop cooperative efforts, within the program established under subsection (a) of this section, to control established aquatic nuisance species to minimize the risk of harm to the environment and the public health and welfare. For purposes of this chapter, control efforts include eradication of infestations, reductions of populations, development of means of adapting human activities and public facilities to accommodate infestations, and prevention of the spread of aquatic nuisance species from infested areas. Such control efforts shall be developed in consultation with affected Federal agencies, States, Indian Tribes, local governments, interjurisdictional organizations, and other appropriate entities. Control actions authorized by this section shall be based on the best available scientific information and shall be conducted in an environmentally sound manner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Task Force or any other affected agency or entity may recommend that the Task Force initiate a control effort. In determining whether a control program is warranted, the Task Force shall evaluate the need for control (including the projected consequences of no control and less than full control); the technical and biological feasibility and cost-effectiveness of alternative control strategies and actions; whether the benefits of control, including costs avoided, exceed the costs of the program; the risk of harm to non-target organisms and ecosystems, public health and welfare; and such other considerations the Task Force determines appropriate. The Task Force shall also determine the nature and extent of control of target aquatic nuisance species that is feasible and desirable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Task Force determines in accordance with paragraph (2) that control of an aquatic nuisance species is warranted, the Task Force shall develop a proposed control program to achieve the target level of control. A notice summarizing the proposed action and solicit<!-- PDFPage:1862 -->ing comments shall be published in the Federal Register, in major newspapers in the region affected, and in principal trade publications of the industries affected.
