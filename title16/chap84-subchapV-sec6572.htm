<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, shall describe and define forest ecosystems that are eligible for enrollment in the healthy forests reserve program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for enrollment in the healthy forests reserve program, land shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) private land the enrollment of which will restore, enhance, or otherwise measurably increase the likelihood of recovery of a species listed as endangered or threatened under section 1533 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private land the enrollment of which will restore, enhance, or otherwise measurably improve the well-being of species that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are not listed as endangered or threatened under section 1533 of this title; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are candidates for such listing, State-listed species, or special concern species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Other considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In enrolling land that satisfies the criteria under subsection (b), the Secretary of Agriculture shall give additional consideration to land the enrollment of which will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) improve biological diversity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) increase carbon sequestration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enrollment by willing owners</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall enroll land in the healthy forests reserve program only with the consent of the owner of the land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Maximum enrollment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total number of acres enrolled in the healthy forests reserve program shall not exceed 2,000,000 acres.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Methods of enrollment</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Enrollment priority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Species</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Agriculture shall give priority to the enrollment of land that provides the greatest conservation benefit to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) secondarily, species that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are not listed as endangered or threatened under section 1533 of this title; but</p>
