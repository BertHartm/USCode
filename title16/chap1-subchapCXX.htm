<h3 class="section-head">&sect;460iii. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management in the State of Idaho within the Snake River Birds of Prey Area contain one of the densest known nesting populations of eagles, falcons, owls, hawks, and other birds of prey (raptors) in North America.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) These public lands constitute a valuable national biological and educational resource since birds of prey are important components of the ecosystem and indicators of environmental quality, and contribute significantly to the quality of wildlife and human communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) These public lands also contain important historic and cultural resources (including significant archaeological resources) as well as other resources and values, all of which should be protected and appropriately managed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A military training area within the Snake River Birds of Prey Area, known as the Orchard Training Area, has been used since 1953 by reserve components of the Armed Forces. Military use of this area is currently governed by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Bureau of Land Management and the State of Idaho Military Division, dated May 1985. Operating under this Memorandum of Understanding, the Idaho National Guard has provided valuable assistance to the Bureau of Land Management with respect to fire control and other aspects of management of the Orchard Training Area and the other lands in the Snake River Birds of Prey Area. Military use of the lands within the Orchard Training Area should continue in accordance with such Memorandum of Understanding (or extension or renewal thereof), to the extent consistent with section 460iii&ndash;3(e) of this title, because this would be in the best interest of training of the reserve components (an important aspect of national security) and of the local economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Protection of the conservation area as a home for raptors can best and should be accomplished by the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, under a management plan that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) emphasizes management, protection, and rehabilitation of habitat for these raptors and of other resources and values of the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides for continued military use, consistent with the requirements of section 460iii&ndash;3(e) of this title, of the Orchard Training Area by reserve components of the Armed Forces;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) addresses the need for public educational and interpretive opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) allows for diverse appropriate uses of lands in the area to the extent consistent with the maintenance and enhancement of raptor populations and habitats and protection and sound management of other resources and values of the area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) demonstrates management practices and techniques that may be useful to other areas of the public lands and elsewhere.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) There exists near the conservation area a facility, the World Center for Birds of Prey operated by The Peregrine Fund, Inc., where research, public education, recovery, and reestablishment operations exist for endangered raptor species. There also exists at Boise State University a raptor study program which attracts national and international graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The Bureau of Land Management and Boise State University, together with other State, Federal, and private entities, have formed the Raptor Research and Technical Assistance Center to be housed at Boise State University, which provides a unique adjunct to the conservation area for raptor management, recovery, research, and public visitation, interpretation, and education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Consistent with requirements of sections 1712 and 1732 of title 43, the Secretary has developed a comprehensive management plan and, based on such plan, has implemented a management program for the public lands included in the conservation area established by this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Additional authority and guidance must be provided to assure that essential raptor habitat remains in public ownership, to facilitate sound and effective planning and management, to provide for effective public interpretation and education, to ensure continued study of the relationship of humans and these raptors, to preserve the unique and irreplaceable habitat of the conservation area, and to conserve and properly manage the other natural resources of the area in concert with maintenance of this habitat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) An ongoing research program funded by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Guard is intended to provide information to be used in connection with future decisionmaking concerning management of all uses, including continued military use, of public lands within the Snake River Birds of Prey Area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Public lands in the Snake River Birds of Prey Area have been used for domestic livestock grazing for more than a century, with resultant benefits to community stability and contributions to the local and State economies. It has not been demonstrated that continuation of this use would be incompatible with appropriate protection and sound management of raptor habitat and the other resource values of these lands; therefore, subject to the determination provided for in section 460iii&ndash;3(f) of this title, it is expected that such <!-- PDFPage:701 -->grazing will continue in accordance with applicable regulations of the Secretary and the management plan for the conservation area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Hydroelectric facilities for the generation and transmission of electricity exist within the Snake River Birds of Prey Area pursuant to a license(s) issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or its predecessor, the Federal Power Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) After completion of the ongoing research concerning military use of lands in the Orchard Training Area or after the date 5 years after August 4, 1993, whichever first occurs, the Secretary shall continue to permit military use of such lands, unless the Secretary, on the basis of such research, determines such use is not compatible with the purposes set forth in section 460iii&ndash;2(a)(2) of this title. Any such use thereafter shall be permitted in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, which may be extended or renewed by the Secretary so long as such use continues to meet the requirements of subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, the Secretary shall require the State of Idaho Military Division to insure that military units involved maintain a program of decontamination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as by itself precluding the extension or renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding, or the construction of any improvements or buildings in the Orchard Training Area so long as the requirements of this subsection are met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Livestock grazing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) So long as the Secretary determines that domestic livestock grazing is compatible with the purposes for which the conservation area is established, the Secretary shall permit such use of public lands within the conservation area, to the extent such use of such lands is compatible with such purposes. Determinations as to compatibility shall be made in connection with the initial revision of management plans for the conservation area and in connection with each plan review required by subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any livestock grazing on public lands within the conservation area, and activities the Secretary determines necessary to carry out proper and practical grazing management programs on such lands (such as animal damage control activities) shall be managed in accordance with the Act of June 28, 1934 (43 U.S.C. 315 et seq.; commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Taylor Grazing Act&rdquo;), section 1752 of title 43, other laws applicable to such use and programs on the public lands, and the management plan for the conservation area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting the Secretary from engaging qualified persons to use public lands within the conservation area for the propagation of plants (including seeds) to be used for vegetative enhancement of the conservation area in accordance with the plan and in furtherance of the purposes for which the conservation area is established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Release</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and directs that the public lands within the Snake River Birds of Prey Natural Area established as a natural area in October 1971 by Public Land Order 5133 have been adequately studied and found unsuitable for wilderness designation pursuant to section 1782 of title 43.
