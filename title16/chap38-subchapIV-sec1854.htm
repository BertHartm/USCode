<p class="statutory-body">(2) The program established pursuant to paragraph (1) shall provide for the identification of stocks of fish which are subject to significant incidental harvest in the course of normal shrimp trawl fishing activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For stocks of fish identified pursuant to paragraph (2), with priority given to stocks which (based upon the best available scientific information) are considered to be overfished, the Secretary shall conduct&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a program to collect and evaluate data on the nature and extent (including the spatial and temporal distribution) of incidental mortality of such stocks as a direct result of shrimp trawl fishing activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an assessment of the status and condition of such stocks, including collection of information which would allow the estimation of life history parameters with sufficient accuracy and precision to support sound scientific evaluation of the effects of various management alternatives on the status of such stocks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a program of data collection and evaluation for such stocks on the magnitude and distribution of fishing mortality and fishing effort by sources of fishing mortality other than shrimp trawl fishing activity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall, in cooperation with affected interests, commence a program to design, and evaluate the efficacy of, technological devices and other changes in fishing technology for the reduction of incidental mortality of nontarget fishery resources in the course of shrimp trawl fishing activity.

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall, upon completion of the programs required by this subsection, submit a detailed report on the results of such programs to the Committee on Commerce, Science, <!-- PDFPage:1592 -->and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Except as provided in this paragraph, the Secretary may not implement any measures under this chapter to reduce incidental mortality of nontarget fishery resources in the course of shrimp trawl fishing which would restrict the period during which shrimp are harvested or would require the use of any technological device or other change in fishing technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall cease on April 1, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) This paragraph does not apply to any law or regulation in effect on November 28, 1990, nor does it limit in any way the Secretary's authority to take action, including any limitation on entry permitted by this chapter, for the conservation and management of the shrimp fishery resource.</p>
