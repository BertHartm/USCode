<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to enhance the capacity to develop, transfer, apply, monitor, and regularly update practical science-based forest restoration treatments that will reduce the risk of severe wildfires, and improve the health of dry forest and woodland ecosystems in the interior West;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to synthesize and adapt scientific findings from conventional research programs to the implementation of forest and woodland restoration on a landscape scale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to facilitate the transfer of interdisciplinary knowledge required to understand the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of wildfire on ecosystems and landscapes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to require the Institutes established under this chapter to collaborate with Federal agencies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to use ecological restoration treatments to reverse declining forest health and reduce the risk of severe wildfires across the forest landscape; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to design, implement, monitor, and regularly revise representative wildfire treatments based on the use of adaptive ecosystem management;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to assist land managers in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) treating acres with restoration-based applications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) using new management technologies (including the transfer of understandable information, assistance with environmental review, and field and classroom training and collaboration) to accomplish the goals identified in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the National Fire Plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the report entitled &ldquo;Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems-A Cohesive Strategy&rdquo; (65 Fed. Reg. 67480); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the report entitled &ldquo;10-Year Comprehensive Strategy: A Collaborative Approach for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to Communities and the Environment&rdquo; of the Western Governors&rsquo; Association;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to provide technical assistance to collaborative efforts by affected entities to develop, implement, and monitor adaptive ecosystem management restoration treatments that are ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially responsible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to assist Federal and non-Federal land managers in providing information to the public on the role of fire and fire management in dry forest and woodland ecosystems in the interior West.</p>
