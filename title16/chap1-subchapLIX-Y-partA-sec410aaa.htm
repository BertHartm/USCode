<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) proclamations by Presidents Herbert Hoover in 1933 and Franklin Roosevelt in 1937 established and expanded the Death Valley National Monument for the preservation of the unusual features of scenic, scientific, and educational interest therein contained;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Death Valley National Monument is today recognized as a major unit of the National Park System, having extraordinary values enjoyed by millions of visitors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the monument boundaries established in the 1930's exclude and thereby expose to incompatible development and inconsistent management, contiguous Federal lands of essential and superlative natural, ecological, geological, archeological, paleontological, cultural, historical ad&nbsp;<sup><a href="#410aaa_1_target" name="410aaa_1">1</a></sup> wilderness values;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Death Valley National Monument should be substantially enlarged by the addition of all contiguous Federal lands of national park caliber and afforded full recognition and statutory protection as a National Park; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the wilderness within Death Valley should receive maximum statutory protection by designation pursuant to the Wilderness Act [16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.].</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 103&ndash;433 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the federally owned desert lands of southern California constitute a public wildland resource of extraordinary and inestimable value for this and future generations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) these desert wildlands display unique scenic, historical, archeological, environmental, ecological, wildlife, cultural, scientific, educational, and recreational values used and enjoyed by millions of Americans for hiking and camping, scientific study and scenic appreciation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the public land resources of the California desert now face and are increasingly threatened by adverse pressures which would impair, dilute, and destroy their public and natural values;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the California desert, embracing wilderness lands, units of the National Park System, other Fed<!-- PDFPage:355 -->eral lands, State parks and other State lands, and private lands, constitutes a cohesive unit posing unique and difficult resource protection and management challenges;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) through designation of national monuments by Presidential proclamation, through enactment of general public land statutes (including section 601 [43 U.S.C. 1781] of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2743, 43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and through interim administrative actions, the Federal Government has begun the process of appropriately providing for protection of the significant resources of the public lands in the California desert; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) statutory land unit designations are needed to afford the full protection which the resources and public land values of the California desert merit.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) In order to secure for the American people of this and future generations an enduring heritage of wilderness, national parks, and public land values in the California desert, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) appropriate public lands in the California desert shall be included within the National Park System and the National Wilderness Preservation System, in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) preserve unrivaled scenic, geologic, and wildlife values associated with these unique natural landscapes;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) perpetuate in their natural state significant and diverse ecosystems of the California desert;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) protect and preserve historical and cultural values of the California desert associated with ancient Indian cultures, patterns of western exploration and settlement, and sites exemplifying the mining, ranching and railroading history of the Old West;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) provide opportunities for compatible outdoor public recreation, protect and interpret ecological and geological features and historic, paleontological, and archeological sites, maintain wilderness resource values, and promote public understanding and appreciation of the California desert; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) retain and enhance opportunities for scientific research in undisturbed ecosystems.&rdquo;</p>
