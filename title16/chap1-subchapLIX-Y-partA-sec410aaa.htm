<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;423, Nov. 1, 2000, 114 Stat. 1875, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Timbisha Shoshone Homeland Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since time immemorial, the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe has lived in portions of California and Nevada. The Tribe's ancestral homeland includes the area that now comprises Death Valley National Park and other areas of California and Nevada now administered by the Bureau of Land Management.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Since 1936, the Tribe has lived and governed the affairs of the Tribe on approximately 40 acres of land near Furnace Creek in the Park.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Tribe achieved Federal recognition in 1983 but does not have a land base within the Tribe's ancestral homeland.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Since the Tribe commenced use and occupancy of the Furnace Creek area, the Tribe's membership has grown. Tribal members have a desire and need for housing, government and administrative facilities, cultural facilities, and sustainable economic development to provide decent, safe, and healthy conditions for themselves and their families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The interests of both the Tribe and the National Park Service would be enhanced by recognizing their coexistence on the same land and by establishing partnerships for compatible land uses and for the interpretation of the Tribe's history and culture for visitors to the Park.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The interests of both the Tribe and the United States would be enhanced by the establishment of a land base for the Tribe and by further delineation of the rights and obligations of each with respect to the Furnace Creek area and to the Park as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Consistent with the recommendations of the report required by section 705(b) of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 [16 U.S.C. 410aaa&ndash;75(b)] (Public Law 103&ndash;433; 108 Stat. 4498), the purposes of this Act are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to provide in trust to the Tribe land on which the Tribe can live permanently and govern the Tribe's affairs in a modern community within the ancestral homeland of the Tribe outside and within the Park;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to formally recognize the contributions by the Tribe to the history, culture, and ecology of the Park and surrounding area;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to ensure that the resources within the Park are protected and enhanced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) cooperative activities within the Tribe's ancestral homeland; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) partnerships between the Tribe and the National Park Service and partnerships involving the Bureau of Land Management;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to ensure that such activities are not in derogation of the purposes and values for which the Park was established;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to provide opportunities for a richer visitor experience at the Park through direct interactions between visitors and the Tribe including guided tours, interpretation, and the establishment of a tribal museum and cultural center;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to provide appropriate opportunities for economically viable and ecologically sustainable visitor-related development, by the Tribe within the Park, that is not in derogation of the purposes and values for which the Park was established; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to provide trust lands for the Tribe in 4 separate parcels of land that is now managed by the Bureau of Land Management and authorize the purchase <!-- PDFPage:355 -->of 2 parcels now held in private ownership to be taken into trust for the Tribe.</p>
