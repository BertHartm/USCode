<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for the purpose of scientific research, the responsibility to meet the requirements of paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) for the purpose of enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock, the responsibility to meet the requirements of paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) finds in concurrence with the Secretary of Agriculture, that a person that holds a permit under this paragraph for a marine mammal, or a person exercising rights under subparagraph (C), no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) and is not reasonably likely to meet those requirements in the near future, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) finds that a person that holds a permit under this paragraph for a marine mammal, or a person exercising rights under subparagraph (C), no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(i) or (iii) and is not reasonably likely to meet those requirements in the near future,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary may revoke the permit in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, seize the marine mammal, or cooperate with other persons authorized to hold marine mammals under this chapter for disposition of the marine mammal. The Secretary may recover from the person expenses incurred by the Secretary for that seizure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) No marine mammal held pursuant to a permit issued under subparagraph (A), or by a person exercising rights under subparagraph (C), may be sold, purchased, exported, or transported unless the Secretary is notified of such action no later than 15 days before such action, and such action is for purposes of public display, scientific research, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock. The Secretary may only require the notification to include the information required for the inventory established under paragraph (10).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary may issue a permit under this paragraph for scientific research purposes to an applicant which submits with its permit application information indicating that the taking is required to further a bona fide scientific purpose. The Secretary may issue a permit under this paragraph before the end of the public review and comment period required under subsection (d)(2) of this section if delaying issuance of the permit could result in injury to a species, stock, or individual, or in loss of unique research opportunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No permit issued for purposes of scientific research shall authorize the lethal taking of a marine mammal unless the applicant demonstrates that a nonlethal method of conducting the research is not feasible. The Secretary shall not issue a permit for research which involves the lethal taking of a marine mammal from a species or stock that is depleted, unless the Secretary determines that the results of such research will directly benefit that species or stock, or that such research fulfills a critically important research need.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not later than 120 days after April 30, 1994, the Secretary shall issue a general authorization and implementing regulations allowing bona fide scientific research that may result only in taking by Level B harassment of a marine mammal. Such authorization shall apply to persons which submit, by 60 days before commencement of such research, a letter of intent via certified mail to the Secretary containing the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The species or stocks of marine mammals which may be harassed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The geographic location of the research.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The period of time over which the research will be conducted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The purpose of the research, including a description of how the definition of bona fide research as established under this chapter would apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Methods to be used to conduct the research.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Not later than 30 days after receipt of a letter of intent to conduct scientific research under the general authorization, the Secretary shall issue a letter to the applicant confirming that the general authorization applies, or, if the proposed research is likely to result in the taking (includ<!-- PDFPage:1382 -->ing Level A harassment) of a marine mammal, shall notify the applicant that subparagraph (A) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A permit may be issued for enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock only with respect to a species or stock for which the Secretary, after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and after notice and opportunity for public comment, has first determined that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) taking or importation is likely to contribute significantly to maintaining or increasing distribution or numbers necessary to ensure the survival or recovery of the species or stock; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) taking or importation is consistent (I) with any conservation plan adopted by the Secretary under section 1383b(b) of this title or any recovery plan developed under section 1533(f) of this title for the species or stock, or (II) if there is no conservation or recovery plan in place, with the Secretary's evaluation of the actions required to enhance the survival or recovery of the species or stock in light of the factors that would be addressed in a conservation plan or a recovery plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A permit issued in accordance with this paragraph may allow the captive maintenance of a marine mammal from a depleted species or stock only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) determines that captive maintenance is likely to contribute to the survival or recovery of the species or stock by maintaining a viable gene pool, increasing productivity, providing biological information, or establishing animal reserves;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) determines that the expected benefit to the affected species or stock outweighs the expected benefit of alternatives which do not require removal of animals from the wild; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) requires that the marine mammal or its progeny be returned to the natural habitat of the species or stock as soon as feasible, consistent with the objectives of any applicable conservation plan or recovery plan, or of any evaluation by the Secretary under subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may allow the public display of such a marine mammal only if the Secretary determines that such display is incidental to the authorized maintenance and will not interfere with the attainment of the survival or recovery objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary may issue a permit for the importation of polar bear parts (other than internal organs) taken in sport hunts in Canada, including polar bears taken but not imported prior to April 30, 1994, to an applicant which submits with its permit application proof that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the applicant. Such a permit shall be issued if the Secretary, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and after notice and opportunity for public comment, finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport hunting program consistent with the purposes of the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Canada has a sport hunting program based on scientifically sound quotas ensuring the maintenance of the affected population stock at a sustainable level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the export and subsequent import are consistent with the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and other international agreements and conventions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the export and subsequent import are not likely to contribute to illegal trade in bear parts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall establish and charge a reasonable fee for permits issued under this paragraph. All fees collected under this paragraph shall be available to the Secretary for use in developing and implementing cooperative research and management programs for the conservation of polar bears in Alaska and Russia pursuant to section 1383(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The Secretary shall undertake a scientific review of the impact of permits issued under this paragraph on the polar bear population stocks in Canada within 2 years after April 30, 1994. The Secretary shall provide an opportunity for public comment during the course of such review, and shall include a response to such public comment in the final report on such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall not issue permits under this paragraph after September 30, 1996, if the Secretary determines, based on the scientific review, that the issuance of permits under this paragraph is having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear population stocks in Canada. The Secretary may review such determination annually thereafter, in light of the best scientific information available, and shall complete the review not later than January 31 in any year a review is undertaken. The Secretary may issue permits under this paragraph whenever the Secretary determines, on the basis of such annual review, that the issuance of permits under this paragraph is not having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear population stocks in Canada.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A permit may be issued for photography for educational or commercial purposes involving marine mammals in the wild only to an applicant which submits with its permit application information indicating that the taking will be limited to Level B harassment, and the manner in which the products of such activities will be made available to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Upon request by a person for a permit under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) for a marine mammal which is in the possession of any person authorized to possess it under this chapter and which is determined under guidance under section 1421a(a) of this title not to be releasable to the wild, the Secretary shall issue the permit to the person requesting the permit if that person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) meets the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of paragraph (2)(A), in the case of a request for a permit under paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) meets the requirements of paragraph (3), in the case of a request for a permit under that paragraph; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish and charge a reasonable fee for permits issued under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) General permits; extension of general permit to American Tunaboat Association; monitoring of incidental taking of marine mammals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Consistent with the regulations prescribed pursuant to section 1373 of this title and to the requirements of section 1371 of this title, the Secretary may issue general permits for the taking of such marine mammals, together with regulations to cover the use of such general permits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the general permit issued under paragraph (1) on December 1, 1980 to the American Tunaboat Association is extended to authorize and govern the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna during each year after December 31, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The extension granted under subparagraph (A) is subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The extension shall cease to have force and effect at the time the general permit is surrendered or terminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The permittee and certificate holders shall use the best marine mammal safety techniques and equipment that are economically and technologically practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) During the period of the extension, the terms and conditions of the general permit that are in effect on July 17, 1984, shall apply, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the Secretary may make such adjustments as may be appropriate to those terms and conditions that pertain to fishing gear and fishing practice requirements and to permit administration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) any such term and condition may be amended or terminated if the amendment or termination is based on the best scientific information available, including that obtained under the monitoring program required under paragraph (3)(A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) during each year of the extension, not to exceed 250 coastal spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) and not to exceed 2,750 eastern spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) may be incidentally taken under the general permit, and no accidental taking of either species is authorized at any time when incidental taking of that species is permitted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The Secretary shall, by January 1, 1989, prescribe regulations to ensure that the backdown procedure during sets of the purse seine net on marine mammals is completed and rolling of the net to sack up has begun no later than thirty minutes after sundown. The Secretary may waive or otherwise modify such regulations for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a designated certificate holder on an observed trip if the Secretary determines, based on observer reports, that such restriction is not necessary because the certificate holder has consistently utilized fishing techniques and equipment so as to result in an incidental marine mammal mortality rate during sundown sets that is no higher than the average such rate for the fleet during daylight sets; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) all certificate holders on observed trips if the Secretary determines that such restriction is not necessary because all certificate holders have developed and are utilizing fishing techniques and equipment that assure that the incidental marine mammal mortality rate during sundown sets will be no higher than such rate during daylight sets.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) The Secretary may authorize, after public notice and opportunity for comment, designated certificate holders to conduct experimental fishing operations on observed trips, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, for the purpose of testing proposed improvements in fishing techniques and equipment that may reduce the incidental mortality of marine mammals in the course of commercial yellowfin tuna fishing operations, and the Secretary may waive such terms and conditions of the general permit and this section, other than the quotas on incidental taking of marine mammals and the prohibition against encircling pure schools of certain species of marine mammals, as the Secretary determines to be necessary and appropriate for the conduct of such experimental fishing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) The Secretary, after public notice and opportunity for comment and consultation with the skippers&rsquo; panel of experts established pursuant to the general permit, shall develop <!-- PDFPage:1385 -->and implement by not later than the beginning of the 1990 fishing season a system of performance standards to maintain the diligence and proficiency of certificate holders in the use of the best marine mammal safety techniques and equipment that are economically and technologically practicable. The system shall include such arrangements as are necessary for the identification of certificate holders whose incidental marine mammal mortality rate is consistently and substantially higher than the average rate of the fleet, and for the supplemental training and observation of such certificate holders, and provisions for suspension or revocation of certificates of inclusion of those certificate holders whose unacceptably high rate of incidental taking reflects a lack of diligence or proficiency in the use of the best marine mammal safety techniques and equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) It shall be unlawful to use any explosive devices other than class C explosive pest control devices in the course of commercial yellowfin tuna fishing subject to the general permit. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations, effective April 1, 1990, to prohibit or restrict the use of class C explosive pest control devices in the course of commercial yellowfin tuna fishing unless the Secretary determines, based on a study which the Secretary shall undertake, that the use of such devices does not result in physical impairment or increased mortality of marine mammals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) During the 1989 and subsequent fishing seasons, each certificated vessel shall carry on every fishing trip subject to this subsection an official observer certified by the Secretary or by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission for the purpose of conducting research and observing fishing operations unless, for reasons beyond the control of the Secretary, an observer is not available for such purpose. The Secretary may waive this requirement after the 1991 fishing season and establish a less extensive observer program if the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for comment, determines that such an alternative program will provide sufficiently reliable information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ix) The Secretary shall annually convene meetings with representatives of conservation and environmental organizations, the commercial tuna fishing industry, and other interested persons for the purpose of discussing the results of efforts to reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals under this subsection as well as throughout the international fleet as a whole and developing plans for such efforts during the next year. On or before April 1, 1992, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives a comprehensive report on the results of such efforts. The report shall discuss the results of the scientific research programs, performance standards, observer program, prohibition on sundown sets, development of alternative fishing techniques, and other efforts required by this section, and shall include recommendations for such action as the Secretary considers necessary and desirable to reduce further the total mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in the course of commercial yellowfin tuna fishing throughout the international fleet.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The quota on the incidental taking of coastal spotted dolphin and eastern spinner dolphin under paragraph (2)(B)(iii)(III) shall be treated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as within, and not in addition to, the overall annual quota under the general permit on the incidental taking of marine mammals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for purposes of paragraph (2)(B)(iii)(II), as a term of the general permit in effect on July 17, 1984.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall, commencing on January 1, 1985, undertake a scientific research program to monitor for at least five consecutive years, and periodically as necessary thereafter, the indices of abundance and trends of marine mammal population stocks which are incidentally taken in the course of commercial purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary determines, on the basis of the best scientific information available (including that obtained under the monitoring program), that the incidental taking of marine mammals permitted under the general permit referred to in paragraph (2) is having a significant adverse effect on a marine mammal population stock, the Secretary shall take such action as is necessary, after notice and an opportunity for an agency hearing on the record, to modify the applicable incidental take quotas or requirements for gear and fishing practices (or both such quotas and requirements) for such fishing so as to ensure that the marine mammal population stock is not significantly adversely affected by the incidental taking.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For each year after 1984, the Secretary shall include in his annual report to the public and the Congress under section 1373(f) of this title a discussion of the proposed activities to be conducted each year as part of the monitoring program required by subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Commerce for purposes of carrying out the monitoring program required under this paragraph not to exceed $4,000,000 for the period beginning October 1, 1984, and ending September 30, 1988.</p>
