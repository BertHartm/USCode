<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Leasehold surrender interest under new concessions contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On or after November 13, 1998, a concessioner that constructs a capital improvement upon land owned by the United States within a unit of the National Park System pursuant to a concessions contract shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in each capital improvement constructed by a concessioner under a concessions contract, consisting solely of a right to compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A leasehold surrender interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the acquisition of a concessions contract when approved by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concessions contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other termination of a concessions contract and may not be taken for public use except on payment of just compensation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), increased (or decreased) in the same percentage increase (or decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Effective 9 years after November 13, 1998, the Secretary may provide, in any particular new concession contract the Secretary estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be based on either (A) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of years as the time period associated with the straight line depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and regula<!-- PDFPage:2215 -->tions in effect on the day before November 13, 1998, or (B) such alternative formula that is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter. The Secretary may only use such an alternative formula if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in this particular concession contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that such alternative formula is, compared to the standard method of determining value provided for in paragraph (3), necessary in order to provide a fair return to the Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in response to a solicitation that includes such an alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a concessions contract, makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of such additional capital improvement shall be added to the then current value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule for existing possessory interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A concessioner which has obtained a possessory interest as defined pursuant to Public Law 89&ndash;249 (commonly known as the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act; 16 U.S.C. 20 et seq.), as in effect on the day before November 13, 1998, under the terms of a concessions contract entered into before November 13, 1998, shall, upon the expiration or termination of such contract, be entitled to receive compensation for such possessory interest improvements in the amount and manner as described by such concessions contract. Where such a possessory interest is not described in the existing contract, compensation of possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws in effect on the day before November 13, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event such prior concessioner is awarded a new concessions contract after the effective date of this subchapter replacing an existing concessions contract, the existing concessioner shall, instead of directly receiving such possessory interest compensation, have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new contract and shall carry over as the initial value of such leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous contract. In the event of a dispute between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of such possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that a new concessioner is awarded a concessions contract and is required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements, the new concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such prior improvements and the initial value in such leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost), shall be an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transition to successor concessioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon expiration or termination of a concessions contract entered into after the effective date of this subchapter, a concessioner shall be entitled under the terms of the concessions contract to receive from the United States or a successor concessioner the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement as of the date of such expiration or termination. A successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement under the terms of a new contract and the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement (instead of construction cost) shall be the amount of money the new concessioner is required to pay the prior concessioner for its leasehold surrender interest under the terms of the prior concessions contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Title to improvements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Title to any capital improvement constructed by a concessioner on lands owned by the United States in a unit of the National Park System shall be vested in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Consumer Price Index</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Consumer Price Index&rdquo; means the &ldquo;Consumer Price Index&mdash;All Urban Consumers&rdquo; published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, unless such index is not published, in which case another regularly published cost-of-living index approximating the Consumer Price Index shall be utilized by the Secretary; and</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Capital improvement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;capital improvement&rdquo; means a structure, fixture, or nonremovable equipment provided by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concessions contract and located on lands of the United States within a unit of the National Park System.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special reporting requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 7 years after November 13, 1998, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives containing a complete analysis of the concession program as well as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an assessment of competition in the solicitation of prospectuses, fair and/or increased return to the Government, and improvement of concession facilities and infrastructure; and</p>
