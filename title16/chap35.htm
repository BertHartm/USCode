<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States have been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) other species of fish, wildlife, and plants have been so depleted in numbers that they are in danger of or threatened with extinction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) these species of fish, wildlife, and plants are of esthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the United States has pledged itself as a sovereign state in the international community to conserve to the extent practicable the various species of fish or wildlife and plants facing extinction, pursuant to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) migratory bird treaties with Canada and Mexico;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Migratory and Endangered Bird Treaty with Japan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the International Convention for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) other international agreements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) encouraging the States and other interested parties, through Federal financial assistance and a system of incentives, to develop and maintain conservation programs which meet national and international standards is a key to meeting the Nation's international commitments and to better safeguarding, for the benefit of all citizens, the Nation's heritage in fish, wildlife, and plants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved, to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and conventions set forth in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is further declared to be the policy of Congress that all Federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is further declared to be the policy of Congress that Federal agencies shall cooperate with State and local agencies to resolve water resource issues in concert with conservation of endangered species.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1533. Determination of endangered species and threatened species</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) of this section determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of any of the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1486 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) disease or predation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to any species over which program responsibilities have been vested in the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Reorganization Plan Numbered 4 of 1970&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in any case in which the Secretary of Commerce determines that such species should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be listed as an endangered species or a threatened species, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) be changed in status from a threatened species to an endangered species,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">he shall so inform the Secretary of the Interior; who shall list such species in accordance with this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any case in which the Secretary of Commerce determines that such species should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be removed from any list published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) be changed in status from an endangered species to a threatened species,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">he shall recommend such action to the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of the Interior, if he concurs in the recommendation, shall implement such action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary of the Interior may not list or remove from any list any such species, and may not change the status of any such species which are listed, without a prior favorable determination made pursuant to this section by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary, by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and to the maximum extent prudent and determinable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall, concurrently with making a determination under paragraph (1) that a species is an endangered species or a threatened species, designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may, from time-to-time thereafter as appropriate, revise such designation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basis for determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall make determinations required by subsection (a)(1) of this section solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts, if any, being made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by predator control, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation practices, within any area under its jurisdiction; or on the high seas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall give consideration to species which have been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) designated as requiring protection from unrestricted commerce by any foreign nation, or pursuant to any international agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) identified as in danger of extinction, or likely to become so within the foreseeable future, by any State agency or by any agency of a foreign nation that is responsible for the conservation of fish or wildlife or plants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall designate critical habitat, and make revisions thereto, under subsection (a)(3) of this section on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) To the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after receiving the petition of an interested person under section 553(e) of title 5, to add a species to, or to remove a species from, either of the lists published under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. If such a petition is found to present such information, the Secretary shall promptly commence a review of the status of the species concerned. The Secretary shall promptly publish each finding made under this subparagraph in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within 12 months after receiving a petition that is found under subparagraph (A) to present substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted, the Secretary shall make one of the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The petitioned action is not warranted, in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The petitioned action is warranted, in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a general notice and the complete text of a proposed regulation to implement such action in accordance with paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The petitioned action is warranted, but that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the immediate proposal and timely promulgation of a final regulation implementing the petitioned action in accordance with paragraphs (5) and (6) is precluded by pending proposals to determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) expeditious progress is being made to add qualified species to either of the lists published under subsection (c) of this section and to remove from such lists species for which the protections of this chapter are no longer necessary,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register, together with a description and evaluation of the reasons and data on which the finding is based.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A petition with respect to which a finding is made under subparagraph (B)(iii) shall be treated as a petition that is resubmitted to the <!-- PDFPage:1487 -->Secretary under subparagraph (A) on the date of such finding and that presents substantial scientific or commercial information that the petitioned action may be warranted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Any negative finding described in subparagraph (A) and any finding described in subparagraph (B)(i) or (iii) shall be subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall implement a system to monitor effectively the status of all species with respect to which a finding is made under subparagraph (B)(iii) and shall make prompt use of the authority under paragraph 7&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1533_1_target" name="1533_1">1</a></sup> to prevent a significant risk to the well being of any such species.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) To the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after receiving the petition of an interested person under section 553(e) of title 5, to revise a critical habitat designation, the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific information indicating that the revision may be warranted. The Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Within 12 months after receiving a petition that is found under clause (i) to present substantial information indicating that the requested revision may be warranted, the Secretary shall determine how he intends to proceed with the requested revision, and shall promptly publish notice of such intention in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection, the provisions of section 553 of title 5 (relating to rulemaking procedures), shall apply to any regulation promulgated to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to any regulation proposed by the Secretary to implement a determination, designation, or revision referred to in subsection (a)(1) or (3) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not less than 90 days before the effective date of the regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) publish a general notice and the complete text of the proposed regulation in the Federal Register, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) give actual notice of the proposed regulation (including the complete text of the regulation) to the State agency in each State in which the species is believed to occur, and to each county, or equivalent jurisdiction in which the species is believed to occur, and invite the comment of such agency, and each such jurisdiction, thereon;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) insofar as practical, and in cooperation with the Secretary of State, give notice of the proposed regulation to each foreign nation in which the species is believed to occur or whose citizens harvest the species on the high seas, and invite the comment of such nation thereon;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) give notice of the proposed regulation to such professional scientific organizations as he deems appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) publish a summary of the proposed regulation in a newspaper of general circulation in each area of the United States in which the species is believed to occur; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) promptly hold one public hearing on the proposed regulation if any person files a request for such a hearing within 45 days after the date of publication of general notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Within the one-year period beginning on the date on which general notice is published in accordance with paragraph (5)(A)(i) regarding a proposed regulation, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) if a determination as to whether a species is an endangered species or a threatened species, or a revision of critical habitat, is involved, either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a final regulation to implement such determination,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) a final regulation to implement such revision or a finding that such revision should not be made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) notice that such one-year period is being extended under subparagraph (B)(i), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) notice that the proposed regulation is being withdrawn under subparagraph (B)(ii), together with the finding on which such withdrawal is based; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) subject to subparagraph (C), if a designation of critical habitat is involved, either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a final regulation to implement such designation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) notice that such one-year period is being extended under such subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If the Secretary finds with respect to a proposed regulation referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) that there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the determination or revision concerned, the Secretary may extend the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) for not more than six months for purposes of soliciting additional data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If a proposed regulation referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) is not promulgated as a final regulation within such one-year period (or longer period if extension under clause (i) applies) because the Secretary finds that there is not sufficient evidence to justify the action proposed by the regulation, the Secretary shall immediately withdraw the regulation.

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) is extended under clause (i) with respect to a proposed regulation, then before the close of such extended period the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register either a final regulation to implement the determination or revision concerned, a finding that the revision should not be made, or a notice of withdrawal of the regulation under clause (ii), together with the finding on which the withdrawal is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A final regulation designating critical habitat of an endangered species or a threatened species shall be published concurrently with the final regulation implementing the determination that such species is endangered or threatened, unless the Secretary deems that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) it is essential to the conservation of such species that the regulation implementing such determination be promptly published; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1488 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) critical habitat of such species is not then determinable, in which case the Secretary, with respect to the proposed regulation to designate such habitat, may extend the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) by not more than one additional year, but not later than the close of such additional year the Secretary must publish a final regulation, based on such data as may be available at that time, designating, to the maximum extent prudent, such habitat.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Neither paragraph (4), (5), or (6) of this subsection nor section 553 of title 5 shall apply to any regulation issued by the Secretary in regard to any emergency posing a significant risk to the well-being of any species of fish or wildlife or plants, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) at the time of publication of the regulation in the Federal Register the Secretary publishes therein detailed reasons why such regulation is necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case such regulation applies to resident species of fish or wildlife, or plants, the Secretary gives actual notice of such regulation to the State agency in each State in which such species is believed to occur.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such regulation shall, at the discretion of the Secretary, take effect immediately upon the publication of the regulation in the Federal Register. Any regulation promulgated under the authority of this paragraph shall cease to have force and effect at the close of the 240-day period following the date of publication unless, during such 240-day period, the rulemaking procedures which would apply to such regulation without regard to this paragraph are complied with. If at any time after issuing an emergency regulation the Secretary determines, on the basis of the best appropriate data available to him, that substantial evidence does not exist to warrant such regulation, he shall withdraw it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The publication in the Federal Register of any proposed or final regulation which is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter shall include a summary by the Secretary of the data on which such regulation is based and shall show the relationship of such data to such regulation; and if such regulation designates or revises critical habitat, such summary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, also include a brief description and evaluation of those activities (whether public or private) which, in the opinion of the Secretary, if undertaken may adversely modify such habitat, or may be affected by such designation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lists</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Interior shall publish in the Federal Register a list of all species determined by him or the Secretary of Commerce to be endangered species and a list of all species determined by him or the Secretary of Commerce to be threatened species. Each list shall refer to the species contained therein by scientific and common name or names, if any, specify with respect to each such species over what portion of its range it is endangered or threatened, and specify any critical habitat within such range. The Secretary shall from time to time revise each list published under the authority of this subsection to reflect recent determinations, designations, and revisions made in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conduct, at least once every five years, a review of all species included in a list which is published pursuant to paragraph (1) and which is in effect at the time of such review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determine on the basis of such review whether any such species should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be removed from such list;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) be changed in status from an endangered species to a threatened species; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) be changed in status from a threatened species to an endangered species.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Each determination under subparagraph (B) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Protective regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any species is listed as a threatened species pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall issue such regulations as he deems necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of such species. The Secretary may by regulation prohibit with respect to any threatened species any act prohibited under section 1538(a)(1) of this title, in the case of fish or wildlife, or section 1538(a)(2) of this title, in the case of plants, with respect to endangered species; except that with respect to the taking of resident species of fish or wildlife, such regulations shall apply in any State which has entered into a cooperative agreement pursuant to section 1535(c) of this title only to the extent that such regulations have also been adopted by such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Similarity of appearance cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, by regulation of commerce or taking, and to the extent he deems advisable, treat any species as an endangered species or threatened species even though it is not listed pursuant to this section if he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such species so closely resembles in appearance, at the point in question, a species which has been listed pursuant to such section that enforcement personnel would have substantial difficulty in attempting to differentiate between the listed and unlisted species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect of this substantial difficulty is an additional threat to an endangered or threatened species; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such treatment of an unlisted species will substantially facilitate the enforcement and further the policy of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Recovery plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall develop and implement plans (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;recovery plans&rdquo;) for the conservation and survival of endangered species and threatened species listed pursuant to this section, unless he finds that such a plan will not promote the conservation of the species. The Secretary, in developing and implementing recovery plans, shall, to the maximum extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give priority to those endangered species or threatened species, without regard to taxonomic classification, that are most likely to benefit from such plans, particularly those <!-- PDFPage:1489 -->species that are, or may be, in conflict with construction or other development projects or other forms of economic activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) incorporate in each plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a description of such site-specific management actions as may be necessary to achieve the plan's goal for the conservation and survival of the species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) objective, measurable criteria which, when met, would result in a determination, in accordance with the provisions of this section, that the species be removed from the list; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) estimates of the time required and the cost to carry out those measures needed to achieve the plan's goal and to achieve intermediate steps toward that goal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, in developing and implementing recovery plans, may procure the services of appropriate public and private agencies and institutions, and other qualified persons. Recovery teams appointed pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall report every two years to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives on the status of efforts to develop and implement recovery plans for all species listed pursuant to this section and on the status of all species for which such plans have been developed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall, prior to final approval of a new or revised recovery plan, provide public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment on such plan. The Secretary shall consider all information presented during the public comment period prior to approval of the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each Federal agency shall, prior to implementation of a new or revised recovery plan, consider all information presented during the public comment period under paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall implement a system in cooperation with the States to monitor effectively for not less than five years the status of all species which have recovered to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this chapter are no longer necessary and which, in accordance with the provisions of this section, have been removed from either of the lists published under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall make prompt use of the authority under paragraph 7&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1533_2_target" name="1533_2">2</a></sup> of subsection (b) of this section to prevent a significant risk to the well being of any such recovered species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Agency guidelines; publication in Federal Register; scope; proposals and amendments: notice and opportunity for comments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish, and publish in the Federal Register, agency guidelines to insure that the purposes of this section are achieved efficiently and effectively. Such guidelines shall include, but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) procedures for recording the receipt and the disposition of petitions submitted under subsection (b)(3) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) criteria for making the findings required under such subsection with respect to petitions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a ranking system to assist in the identification of species that should receive priority review under subsection (a)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a system for developing and implementing, on a priority basis, recovery plans under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall provide to the public notice of, and opportunity to submit written comments on, any guideline (including any amendment thereto) proposed to be established under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Submission to State agency of justification for regulations inconsistent with State agency's comments or petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in the case of any regulation proposed by the Secretary under the authority of this section, a State agency to which notice thereof was given in accordance with subsection (b)(5)(A)(ii) of this section files comments disagreeing with all or part of the proposed regulation, and the Secretary issues a final regulation which is in conflict with such comments, or if the Secretary fails to adopt a regulation pursuant to an action petitioned by a State agency under subsection (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary shall submit to the State agency a written justification for his failure to adopt regulations consistent with the agency's comments or petition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the program authorized by this chapter, the Secretary shall cooperate to the maximum extent practicable with the States. Such cooperation shall include consultation with the States concerned before acquiring any land or water, or interest therein, for the purpose of conserving any endangered species or threatened species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Management agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into agreements with any State for the administration and man<!-- PDFPage:1492 -->agement of any area established for the conservation of endangered species or threatened species. Any revenues derived from the administration of such areas under these agreements shall be subject to the provisions of section 715s of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cooperative agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to enter into a cooperative agreement in accordance with this section with any State which establishes and maintains an adequate and active program for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species. Within one hundred and twenty days after the Secretary receives a certified copy of such a proposed State program, he shall make a determination whether such program is in accordance with this chapter. Unless he determines, pursuant to this paragraph, that the State program is not in accordance with this chapter, he shall enter into a cooperative agreement with the State for the purpose of assisting in implementation of the State program. In order for a State program to be deemed an adequate and active program for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species, the Secretary must find, and annually thereafter reconfirm such finding, that under the State program&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In furtherance of the purposes of this chapter the Secretary is authorized to enter into a cooperative agreement in accordance with this section with any State which establishes and maintains an adequate and active program for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species of plants.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the requirements set forth in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of this paragraph are complied with, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) plans are included under which immediate attention will be given to those resident species of plants which are determined by the Secretary or the State agency to be endangered or threatened and which the Secretary and the State agency agree are most urgently in need of conservation programs; except that a cooperative agreement entered into with a State whose program is deemed adequate and active pursuant to clause (i) and this clause shall not affect the applicability of prohibitions set forth in or authorized pursuant to section 1533(d) or section 1538(a)(1) of this title with respect to the taking of any resident endangered or threatened species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allocation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance to any State, through its respective State agency, which has entered into a <!-- PDFPage:1493 -->cooperative agreement pursuant to subsection (c) of this section to assist in development of programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species or to assist in monitoring the status of candidate species pursuant to subparagraph (C) of section 1533(b)(3) of this title and recovered species pursuant to section 1533(g) of this title. The Secretary shall allocate each annual appropriation made in accordance with the provisions of subsection (i) of this section to such States based on consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the international commitments of the United States to protect endangered species or threatened species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the readiness of a State to proceed with a conservation program consistent with the objectives and purposes of this chapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) the importance of monitoring the status of recovered species within a State to assure that such species do not return to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this chapter are again necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">So much of the annual appropriation made in accordance with provisions of subsection (i) of this section allocated for obligation to any State for any fiscal year as remains unobligated at the close thereof is authorized to be made available to that State until the close of the succeeding fiscal year. Any amount allocated to any State which is unobligated at the end of the period during which it is available for expenditure is authorized to be made available for expenditure by the Secretary in conducting programs under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such cooperative agreements shall provide for (A) the actions to be taken by the Secretary and the States; (B) the benefits that are expected to be derived in connection with the conservation of endangered or threatened species; (C) the estimated cost of these actions; and (D) the share of such costs to be borne by the Federal Government and by the States; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Federal share of such program costs shall not exceed 75 percent of the estimated program cost stated in the agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the Federal share may be increased to 90 percent whenever two or more States having a common interest in one or more endangered or threatened species, the conservation of which may be enhanced by cooperation of such States, enter jointly into an agreement with the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may, in his discretion, and under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, advance funds to the State for financing the United States pro rata share agreed upon in the cooperative agreement. For the purposes of this section, the non-Federal share may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be in the form of money or real property, the value of which will be determined by the Secretary, whose decision shall be final.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review of State programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any action taken by the Secretary under this section shall be subject to his periodic review at no greater than annual intervals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Conflicts between Federal and State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State law or regulation which applies with respect to the importation or exportation of, or interstate or foreign commerce in, endangered species or threatened species is void to the extent that it may effectively (1) permit what is prohibited by this chapter or by any regulation which implements this chapter, or (2) prohibit what is authorized pursuant to an exemption or permit provided for in this chapter or in any regulation which implements this chapter. This chapter shall not otherwise be construed to void any State law or regulation which is intended to conserve migratory, resident, or introduced fish or wildlife, or to permit or prohibit sale of such fish or wildlife. Any State law or regulation respecting the taking of an endangered species or threatened species may be more restrictive than the exemptions or permits provided for in this chapter or in any regulation which implements this chapter but not less restrictive than the prohibitions so defined.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;establishment period&rdquo; means, with respect to any State, the period beginning on December 28, 1973, and ending on whichever of the following dates first occurs: (A) the date of the close of the 120-day period following the adjournment of the first regular session of the legislature of such State which commences after December 28, 1973, or (B) the date of the close of the 15-month period following December 28, 1973.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The prohibitions set forth in or authorized pursuant to sections 1533(d) and 1538(a)(1)(B) of this title shall not apply with respect to the taking of any resident endangered species or threatened species (other than species listed in Appendix I to the Convention or otherwise specifically covered by any other treaty or Federal law) within any State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which is then a party to a cooperative agreement with the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section (except to the extent that the taking of any such species is contrary to the law of such State); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) except for any time within the establishment period when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Secretary applies such prohibition to such species at the request of the State, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Secretary applies such prohibition after he finds, and publishes his finding, that an emergency exists posing a significant risk to the well-being of such species and that the prohibition must be applied to protect such species. The Secretary's finding and publication may be made without regard to the public hearing or comment provisions of section 553 of title 5 or any other provi<!-- PDFPage:1494 -->sion of this chapter; but such prohibition shall expire 90 days after the date of its imposition unless the Secretary further extends such prohibition by publishing notice and a statement of justification of such extension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to promulgate such regulations as may be appropriate to carry out the provisions of this section relating to financial assistance to States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To carry out the provisions of this section for fiscal years after September 30, 1988, there shall be deposited into a special fund known as the cooperative endangered species conservation fund, to be administered by the Secretary, an amount equal to 5 percent of the combined amounts covered each fiscal year into the Federal aid to wildlife restoration fund under section 669b of this title, and paid, transferred, or otherwise credited each fiscal year to the Sport Fishing Restoration Account established under 1016 of the Act of July 18, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts deposited into the special fund are authorized to be appropriated annually and allocated in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.</p>

Such regulations may be established with reference to species, geographical description of the area included, the season for taking, or any other factors related to the reason for establishing such regulations and consistent with the policy of this chapter. Such regulations shall be prescribed after a notice and hearings in the affected judicial districts of Alaska and as otherwise required by section 1373 of this title, and shall be removed as soon as the Secretary determines that the need for their impositions has disappeared.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Civil penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who knowingly violates, and any person engaged in business as an importer or exporter of fish, wildlife, or plants who violates, any provision of this chapter, or any provision of any permit or certificate issued hereunder, or of any regulation issued in order to implement subsection (a)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (F), (a)(2)(A), (B), (C), or (D), (c), (d) (other than regulation relating to recordkeeping or filing of reports), (f) or (g) of section 1538 of this title, may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $25,000 for each violation. Any person who knowingly violates, and any person engaged in business as an importer or exporter of fish, wildlife, or plants who violates, any provision of any other regulation issued under this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $12,000 for each such violation. Any person who otherwise violates any provision of this chapter, or any regulation, permit, or certificate issued hereunder, may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $500 for each such violation. No penalty may be assessed under this subsection unless such person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to such violation. Each violation shall be a separate offense. Any such civil penalty may be remitted or mitigated by the Secretary. Upon any failure to pay a penalty assessed under this subsection, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business to collect the penalty and such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. The court shall hear such action on the record made before the Secretary and shall sustain his action if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Hearings held during proceedings for the assessment of civil penalties authorized by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with section 554 of title 5. The Secretary may issue subpenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, and administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena served upon any person pursuant to this paragraph, the district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found or resides or transacts business, upon application by the United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony before the Secretary or to appear and produce documents before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no civil penalty shall be imposed if it can be shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed an act based on a good faith belief that he was acting to protect himself or herself, a member of his or her family, or any other individual from bodily harm, from any endangered or threatened species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criminal violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this chapter, of any permit or certificate issued hereunder, or of any regulation issued in order to implement subsection (a)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (F), (a)(2)(A), (B), (C), or (D), (c), (d) (other than a regulation relating to recordkeeping, or filing of reports), (f), or (g) of section 1538 of this title shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $50,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Any person who knowingly violates any provision of <!-- PDFPage:1513 -->any other regulation issued under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of any Federal agency which has issued a lease, license, permit, or other agreement authorizing a person to import or export fish, wildlife, or plants, or to operate a quarantine station for imported wildlife, or authorizing the use of Federal lands, including grazing of domestic livestock, to any person who is convicted of a criminal violation of this chapter or any regulation, permit, or certificate issued hereunder may immediately modify, suspend, or revoke each lease, license, permit, or other agreement. The Secretary shall also suspend for a period of up to one year, or cancel, any Federal hunting or fishing permits or stamps issued to any person who is convicted of a criminal violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation, permit, or certificate issued hereunder. The United States shall not be liable for the payments of any compensation, reimbursement, or damages in connection with the modification, suspension, or revocation of any leases, licenses, permits, stamps, or other agreements pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, it shall be a defense to prosecution under this subsection if the defendant committed the offense based on a good faith belief that he was acting to protect himself or herself, a member of his or her family, or any other individual, from bodily harm from any endangered or threatened species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) District court jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The several district courts of the United States, including the courts enumerated in section 460 of title 28, shall have jurisdiction over any actions arising under this chapter. For the purpose of this chapter, American Samoa shall be included within the judicial district of the District Court of the United States for the District of Hawaii.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rewards and incidental expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary or the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay, from sums received as penalties, fines, or forfeitures of property for any violation of this chapter or any regulation issued hereunder (1) a reward to any person who furnishes information which leads to an arrest, a criminal conviction, civil penalty assessment, or forfeiture of property for any violation of this chapter or any regulation issued hereunder. The amount of the reward, if any, is to be designated by the Secretary or the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate. Any officer or employee of the United States or any State or local government who furnishes information or renders service in the performance of his official duties is ineligible for payment under this subsection, and (2) the reasonable and necessary costs incurred by any person in providing temporary care for any fish, wildlife, or plant pending the disposition of any civil or criminal proceeding alleging a violation of this chapter with respect to that fish, wildlife, or plant. Whenever the balance of sums received under this section and section 3375(d) of this title, as penalties or fines, or from forfeitures of property, exceed $500,000, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit an amount equal to such excess balance in the cooperative endangered species conservation fund established under section 1535(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this chapter and any regulations or permits issued pursuant thereto shall be enforced by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, or all such Secretaries. Each such Secretary may utilize by agreement, with or without reimbursement, the personnel, services, and facilities of any other Federal agency or any State agency for purposes of enforcing this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The judges of the district courts of the United States and the United States magistrate judges may, within their respective jurisdictions, upon proper oath or affirmation showing probable cause, issue such warrants or other process as may be required for enforcement of this chapter and any regulation issued thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person authorized by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, to enforce this chapter may detain for inspection and inspect any package, crate, or other container, including its contents, and all accompanying documents, upon importation or exportation. Such person may make arrests without a warrant for any violation of this chapter if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested is committing the violation in his presence or view, and may execute and serve any arrest warrant, search warrant, or other warrant or civil or criminal process issued by any officer or court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement of this chapter. Such person so authorized may search and seize, with or without a warrant, as authorized by law. Any fish, wildlife, property, or item so seized shall be held by any person authorized by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating pending disposition of civil or criminal proceedings, or the institution of an action in rem for forfeiture of such fish, wildlife, property, or item pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection; except that the Secretary may, in lieu of holding such fish, wildlife, property, or item, permit the owner or consignee to post a bond or other surety satisfactory to the Secretary, but upon forfeiture of any such property to the United States, or the abandonment or waiver of any claim to any such property, it shall be disposed of (other than by sale to the general public) by the Secretary in such a manner, consistent with the purposes of this chapter, as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) All fish or wildlife or plants taken, possessed, sold, purchased, offered for sale or purchase, transported, delivered, received, carried, shipped, exported, or imported contrary to the provisions of this chapter, any regulation made pursuant thereto, or any permit or certificate issued hereunder shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) All provisions of law relating to the seizure, forfeiture, and condemnation of a vessel for violation of the customs laws, the disposition of such vessel or the proceeds from the sale thereof, and the remission or mitigation of such forfeiture, shall apply to the seizures and forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been incurred, under the provisions of this chapter, insofar as such provisions of law are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter; except that all powers, rights, and duties conferred or imposed by the customs laws upon any officer or employee of the Treasury Department shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be exercised or performed by the Secretary or by such persons as he may designate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Attorney General of the United States may seek to enjoin any person who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this chapter or regulation issued under authority thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, are authorized to promulgate such regulations as may be appropriate to enforce this chapter, and charge reasonable fees for expenses to the Government connected with permits or certificates authorized by this chapter including processing applications and reasonable inspections, and with the transfer, board, handling, or storage of fish or wildlife or plants and evidentiary items seized and forfeited under this chapter.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any such suit under this subsection in which the United States is not a party, the Attorney General, at the request of the Secretary, may intervene on behalf of the United States as a matter of right.</p>
