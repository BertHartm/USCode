<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1801. Findings, purposes and policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The fish off the coasts of the United States, the highly migratory species of the high seas, the species which dwell on or in the Continental Shelf appertaining to the United States, and the anadromous species which spawn in United States rivers or estuaries, constitute valuable and renewable natural resources. These fishery resources contribute to the food supply, economy, and health of the Nation and provide recreational opportunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Certain stocks of fish have declined to the point where their survival is threatened, and other stocks of fish have been so substantially reduced in number that they could become similarly threatened as a consequence of (A) increased fishing pressure, (B) the inadequacy of fishery resource conservation and management practices and controls, or (C) direct and indirect habitat losses which have resulted in a diminished capacity to support existing fishing levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Commercial and recreational fishing constitutes a major source of employment and contributes significantly to the economy of the Nation. Many coastal areas are dependent upon fishing and related activities, and their economies have been badly damaged by the overfishing of fishery resources at an ever-increasing rate over the past decade. The activities of massive foreign fishing fleets in waters adjacent to such coastal areas have contributed to such damage, interfered with domestic fishing efforts, and caused destruction of the fishing gear of United States fishermen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) International fishery agreements have not been effective in preventing or terminating the overfishing of these valuable fishery resources. There is danger that irreversible effects from overfishing will take place before an effective international agreement on fishery management jurisdiction can be negotiated, signed, ratified, and implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Fishery resources are finite but renewable. If placed under sound management before overfishing has caused irreversible effects, the fisheries can be conserved and maintained so as to provide optimum yields on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A national program for the conservation and management of the fishery resources of the United States is necessary to prevent overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, to insure conservation, to facilitate long-term protection of essential fish habitats, and to realize the full potential of the Nation's fishery resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A national program for the development of fisheries which are underutilized or not utilized by the United States fishing industry, including bottom fish off Alaska, is necessary to assure that our citizens benefit from the employment, food supply, and revenue which could be generated thereby.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The collection of reliable data is essential to the effective conservation, management, and scientific understanding of the fishery resources of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) One of the greatest long-term threats to the viability of commercial and recreational fisheries is the continuing loss of marine, estuarine, and other aquatic habitats. Habitat considerations should receive increased attention for the conservation and management of fishery resources of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Pacific Insular Areas contain unique historical, cultural, legal, political, and geographical circumstances which make fisheries resources important in sustaining their economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) A number of the Fishery Management Councils have demonstrated significant progress in integrating ecosystem considerations in fisheries management using the existing authorities provided under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) International cooperation is necessary to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and other fishing practices which may harm the sustainability of living marine resources and disadvantage the United States fishing industry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore declared to be the purposes of the Congress in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to take immediate action to conserve and manage the fishery resources found off the coasts of the United States, and the anadromous species and Continental Shelf fishery resources of the United States, by exercising (A) sovereign rights for the purposes of exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing all fish, within the exclusive economic zone established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated March 10, 1983, and (B) exclusive fishery management authority beyond the exclusive economic zone over such anadromous species and Continental Shelf fishery resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to support and encourage the implementation and enforcement of international fishery agreements for the conservation and management of highly migratory species, and to encourage the negotiation and implementation of additional such agreements as necessary;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1853 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to promote domestic commercial and recreational fishing under sound conservation and management principles, including the promotion of catch and release programs in recreational fishing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide for the preparation and implementation, in accordance with national standards, of fishery management plans which will achieve and maintain, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish Regional Fishery Management Councils to exercise sound judgment in the stewardship of fishery resources through the preparation, monitoring, and revision of such plans under circumstances (A) which will enable the States, the fishing industry, consumer and environmental organizations, and other interested persons to participate in, and advise on, the establishment and administration of such plans, and (B) which take into account the social and economic needs of the States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to encourage the development by the United States fishing industry of fisheries which are currently underutilized or not utilized by United States fishermen, including bottom fish off Alaska, and to that end, to ensure that optimum yield determinations promote such development in a non-wasteful manner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to promote the protection of essential fish habitat in the review of projects conducted under Federal permits, licenses, or other authorities that affect or have the potential to affect such habitat.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further declared to be the policy of the Congress in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to maintain without change the existing territorial or other ocean jurisdiction of the United States for all purposes other than the conservation and management of fishery resources, as provided for in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to authorize no impediment to, or interference with, recognized legitimate uses of the high seas, except as necessary for the conservation and management of fishery resources, as provided for in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to assure that the national fishery conservation and management program utilizes, and is based upon, the best scientific information available; involves, and is responsive to the needs of, interested and affected States and citizens; considers efficiency; draws upon Federal, State, and academic capabilities in carrying out research, administration, management, and enforcement; considers the effects of fishing on immature fish and encourages development of practical measures that minimize bycatch and avoid unnecessary waste of fish; and is workable and effective;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to permit foreign fishing consistent with the provisions of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to support and encourage active United States efforts to obtain internationally acceptable agreements which provide for effective conservation and management of fishery resources, and to secure agreements to regulate fishing by vessels or persons beyond the exclusive economic zones of any nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to foster and maintain the diversity of fisheries in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to ensure that the fishery resources adjacent to a Pacific Insular Area, including resident or migratory stocks within the exclusive economic zone adjacent to such areas, be explored, developed, conserved, and managed for the benefit of the people of such area and of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After February 28, 1977, no foreign fishing is authorized within the exclusive economic zone, or for anadromous species or Continental Shelf fishery resources beyond the exclusive economic zone, unless such foreign fishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is authorized under subsections (b) or (c) of this section or section 1824(e) of this title, or under a permit issued under section 1824(d) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not prohibited under subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is conducted under, and in accordance with, a valid and applicable permit issued pursuant to section 1824 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Existing international fishery agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Foreign fishing described in subsection (a) of this section may be conducted pursuant to an international fishery agreement (subject to the provisions of section 1822(b) or (c) of this title), if such agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) was in effect on April 13, 1976; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has not expired, been renegotiated, or otherwise ceased to be of force and effect with respect to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Governing international fishery agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Foreign fishing described in subsection (a) of this section may be conducted pursuant to an international fishery agreement (other than a treaty) which meets the requirements of this subsection if such agreement becomes effective after application of section 1823 of this title. Any such international fishery agreement shall hereafter in this chapter be referred to as a &ldquo;governing international fishery agreement&rdquo;. Each governing international fishery agreement shall acknowledge the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, as set forth in this chapter. It is the sense of the Congress that each such agreement shall include a binding commitment, on the part of such foreign nation and its fishing vessels, to comply with the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The foreign nation, and the owner or operator of any fishing vessel fishing pursuant to such agreement, will abide by all regulations promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter, including any regulations promulgated to implement any applicable fishery management plan or any preliminary fishery management plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The foreign nation, and the owner or operator of any fishing vessel fishing pursuant to such agreement, will abide by the requirement that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any officer authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter (as provided for in section 1861 of this title) be permitted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to board, and search or inspect, any such vessel at any time,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to make arrests and seizures provided for in section 1861(b) of this title whenever such officer has reasonable cause to believe, as a result of such a search or inspection, that any such vessel or any person has committed an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to examine and make notations on the permit issued pursuant to section 1824 of this title for such vessel;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the permit issued for any such vessel pursuant to section 1824 of this title be prominently displayed in the wheelhouse of such vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) transponders, or such other appropriate position-fixing and identification equipment as the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating determines to be appropriate, be installed and maintained in working order on each such vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) United States observers required under subsection (h) of this section be permitted to be stationed aboard any such vessel and that all of the costs incurred incident to such stationing, including the costs of data editing and entry and observer monitoring, be paid for, in accordance with such subsection, by the owner or operator of the vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any fees required under section 1824(b)(10) of this title be paid in advance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) agents be appointed and maintained within the United States who are authorized to receive and respond to any legal process issued in the United States with respect to such owner or operator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) responsibility be assumed, in accordance with any requirements prescribed by the Secretary, for the reimbursement of United States citizens for any loss of, or damage to, their fishing vessels, fishing gear, or catch which is caused by any fishing vessel of that nation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and will abide by any other monitoring, compliance, or enforcement requirement related to fishery conservation and management which is included in such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The foreign nation and the owners or operators of all of the fishing vessels of such nation shall not, in any year, harvest an amount of fish which exceeds such nation's allocation of the total allowable level of foreign fishing, as determined under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The foreign nation will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) apply, pursuant to section 1824 of this title, for any required permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) deliver promptly to the owner or operator of the appropriate fishing vessel any permit which is issued under that section for such vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) abide by, and take appropriate steps under its own laws to assure that all such owners and operators comply with, section 1824(a) of this title and the applicable conditions and restrictions established under section 1824(b)(7) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) take, or refrain from taking, as appropriate, actions of the kind referred to in sub<!-- PDFPage:1864 -->section (e)(1) of this section in order to receive favorable allocations under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Total allowable level of foreign fishing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total allowable level of foreign fishing, if any, with respect to any fishery subject to the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, is that portion of the optimum yield of such fishery which cannot, or will not, be harvested by vessels of the United States, as determined in accordance with this chapter. Allocations of the total allowable level of foreign fishing are discretionary, except that the total allowable level shall be zero for fisheries determined by the Secretary to have adequate or excess domestic harvest capacity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allocation of allowable level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, may make allocations to foreign nations from the total allowable level of foreign fishing which is permitted with respect to each fishery subject to the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) From the determinations made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of State shall compute the aggregate of all of the fishery allocations made to each foreign nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary of State shall initially release to each foreign nation for harvesting up to 50 percent of the allocations aggregate computed for such nation under subparagraph (B), and such release of allocation shall be apportioned by the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, among the individual fishery allocations determined for that nation under subparagraph (A). The basis on which each apportionment is made under this subparagraph shall be stated in writing by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) After the initial release of fishery allocations under subparagraph (C) to a foreign nation, any subsequent release of an allocation for any fishery to such nation shall only be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) after the lapse of such period of time as may be sufficient for purposes of making the determination required under clause (ii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if the Secretary of State and the Secretary, after taking into account the size of the allocation for such fishery and the length and timing of the fishing season, determine in writing that such nation is complying with the purposes and intent of this paragraph with respect to such fishery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the foreign nation is not determined under clause (ii) to be in such compliance, the Secretary of State shall reduce, in a manner and quantity he considers to be appropriate (I) the remainder of such allocation, or (II) if all of such allocation has been released, the next allocation of such fishery, if any, made to such nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The determinations required to be made under subparagraphs (A) and (D)(ii), and the apportionments required to be made under subparagraph (C), with respect to a foreign nation shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) whether, and to what extent, such nation imposes tariff barriers or nontariff barriers on the importation, or otherwise restricts the market access, of both United States fish and fishery products, particularly fish and fishery products for which the foreign nation has requested an allocation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) whether, and to what extent, such nation is cooperating with the United States in both the advancement of existing and new opportunities for fisheries exports from the United States through the purchase of fishery products from United States processors, and the advancement of fisheries trade through the purchase of fish and fishery products from United States fishermen, particularly fish and fishery products for which the foreign nation has requested an allocation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) whether, and to what extent, such nation and the fishing fleets of such nation have cooperated with the United States in the enforcement of United States fishing regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) whether, and to what extent, such nation requires the fish harvested from the exclusive economic zone for its domestic consumption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) whether, and to what extent, such nation otherwise contributes to, or fosters the growth of, a sound and economic United States fishing industry, including minimizing gear conflicts with fishing operations of United States fishermen, and transferring harvesting or processing technology which will benefit the United States fishing industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) whether, and to what extent, the fishing vessels of such nation have traditionally engaged in fishing in such fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) whether, and to what extent, such nation is cooperating with the United States in, and making substantial contributions to, fishery research and the identification of fishery resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) such other matters as the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, deems appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For the purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The term &ldquo;certification&rdquo; means a certification made by the Secretary that nationals of a foreign country, directly or indirectly, are conducting fishing operations or engaging in trade or taking which diminishes the effectiveness of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. A certification under this section shall also be deemed a certification for the purposes of section 1978(a) of title 22.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term &ldquo;remedial period&rdquo; means the 365-day period beginning on the date on which a certification is issued with respect to a foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary issues a certification with respect to any foreign country, then each allocation under paragraph (1) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is in effect for that foreign country on the date of issuance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is not in effect on such date but would, without regard to this paragraph, be made to the foreign country within the remedial period;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be reduced by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, by not less than 50 percent.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1865 --><p class="statutory-body">(C) The following apply for purposes of administering subparagraph (B) with respect to any foreign country:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If on the date of certification, the foreign country has harvested a portion, but not all, of the quantity of fish specified under any allocation, the reduction under subparagraph (B) for that allocation shall be applied with respect to the quantity not harvested as of such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If the Secretary notified the Secretary of State that it is not likely that the certification of the foreign country will be terminated under section 1978(d) of title 22 before the close of the period for which an allocation is applicable or before the close of the remedial period (whichever close first occurs) the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, shall reallocate any portion of any reduction made under subparagraph (B) among one or more foreign countries for which no certification is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) If the certification is terminated under such section 1978(d) of title 22 during the remedial period, the Secretary of State shall return to the foreign country that portion of any allocation reduced under subparagraph (B) that was not reallocated under clause (ii); unless the harvesting of the fish covered by the allocation is otherwise prohibited under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The Secretary may refund or credit, by reason of reduction of any allocation under this paragraph, any fee paid under section 1824 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the certification of a foreign country is not terminated under section 1978(d) of title 22 before the close of the last day of the remedial period, the Secretary of State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to any allocation made to that country and in effect (as reduced under subparagraph (B)) on such last day, shall rescind, effective on and after the day after such last day, any unharvested portion of such allocation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) may not thereafter make any allocation to that country under paragraph (1) until the certification is terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reciprocity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Foreign fishing shall not be authorized for the fishing vessels of any foreign nation unless such nation satisfies the Secretary and the Secretary of State that such nation extends substantially the same fishing privileges to fishing vessels of the United States, if any, as the United States extends to foreign fishing vessels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Preliminary fishery management plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, when notified by the Secretary of State that any foreign nation has submitted an application under section 1824(b) of this title shall prepare a preliminary fishery management plan for any fishery covered by such application if the Secretary determines that no fishery management plan for that fishery will be prepared and implemented, pursuant to subchapter IV of this chapter, before March 1, 1977. To the extent practicable, each such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall contain a preliminary description of the fishery and a preliminary determination as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the optimum yield from such fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when appropriate, the capacity and extent to which United States fish processors will process that portion of such optimum yield that will be harvested by vessels of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total allowable level of foreign fishing with respect to such fishery;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The failure to pay any surcharge imposed under this paragraph shall be treated by the Secretary as a failure to pay the permit fee for such vessel under section 1824(b)(10) of this title. All surcharges collected by the Secretary under this paragraph shall be deposited in the Foreign Fishing Observer Fund established by paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) There is established in the Treasury of the United States the Foreign Fishing Observer Fund. The Fund shall be available to the Secretary as a revolving fund for the purpose of carrying out this subsection. The Fund shall consist of the surcharges deposited into it as required under paragraph (4). All payments made by the Secretary to carry out this subsection shall be paid from the Fund, only to the extent and in the amounts provided for in advance in appropriation Acts. Sums in the Fund which are not currently needed for the purposes of this subsection shall be kept on deposit or invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) he has been unable, within a reasonable period of time, to conclude with any foreign nation an international fishery agreement allowing fishing vessels of the United States equitable access to fisheries over which that nation asserts exclusive fishery management authority, including fisheries for tuna species, as recognized by the United States, in accordance with fishing activities of such vessels, if any, and under terms not more restrictive than those established under sections 1821(c) and (d) and 1824(b)(7) and (10) of this title, because such nation has (A) refused to commence negotiations, or (B) failed to negotiate in good faith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any foreign nation is not allowing fishing vessels of the United States to engage in fishing for tuna species in accordance with an applicable international fishery agreement, whether or not such nation is a party thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any foreign nation is not complying with its obligations under any existing international fishery agreement concerning fishing by fishing vessels of the United States in any fishery over which that nation asserts exclusive fishery management authority; or</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1826. Large-scale driftnet fishing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section incorporates and expands upon provisions of the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 and may be cited as the &ldquo;Driftnet Act Amendments of 1990&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the continued widespread use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation is a destructive fishing practice that poses a threat to living marine resources of the world's oceans, including but not limited to the North and South Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the use of large-scale driftnets is expanding into new regions of the world's oceans, including the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a pressing need for detailed and reliable information on the number of seabirds, sea turtles, nontarget fish, and marine mammals that become entangled and die in actively fished large-scale driftnets and in large-scale driftnets that are lost, abandoned, or discarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increased efforts, including reliable observer data and enforcement mechanisms, are <!-- PDFPage:1885 -->needed to monitor, assess, control, and reduce the adverse impact of large-scale driftnet fishing on living marine resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the nations of the world have agreed in the United Nations, through General Assembly Resolution Numbered 44&ndash;225, approved December 22, 1989, by the General Assembly, that a moratorium should be imposed by June 30, 1992, on the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the nations of the South Pacific have agreed to a moratorium on the use of large-scale driftnets in the South Pacific through the Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific, which was agreed to in Wellington, New Zealand, on November 29, 1989; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) increasing population pressures and new knowledge of the importance of living marine resources to the health of the global ecosystem demand that greater responsibility be exercised by persons fishing or developing new fisheries beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared to be the policy of the Congress in this section that the United States should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) implement the moratorium called for by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution Numbered 44&ndash;225;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) support the Tarawa Declaration and the Wellington Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) secure a permanent ban on the use of destructive fishing practices, and in particular large-scale driftnets, by persons or vessels fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) International agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, through the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall seek to secure international agreements to implement immediately the findings, policy, and provisions of this section, and in particular an international ban on large-scale driftnet fishing. The Secretary, through the Secretary of State, shall include, in any agreement which addresses the taking of living marine resources of the United States, provisions to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) each large-scale driftnet fishing vessel of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement, including vessels that may operate independently to develop new fishing areas, which operate beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is included in such agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) each large-scale driftnet fishing vessel of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement, which operates beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is equipped with satellite transmitters which provide real-time position information accessible to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) statistically reliable monitoring by the United States is carried out, through the use of on-board observers or through dedicated platforms provided by foreign nations that are parties to the agreement, of all target and nontarget fish species, marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds entangled or killed by large-scale driftnets used by fishing vessels of foreign nations that are parties to the agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) officials of the United States have the right to board and inspect for violations of the agreement any large-scale driftnet fishing vessels operating under the flag of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement at any time while such vessel is operating in designated areas beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) all catch landed or transshipped at sea by large-scale driftnet fishing vessels of a foreign nation that is a party to the agreement, and which are operated beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is reliably monitored and documented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) time and area restrictions are imposed on the use of large-scale driftnets in order to prevent interception of anadromous species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) all large-scale driftnets used are constructed, insofar as feasible, with biodegradable materials which break into segments that do not represent a threat to living marine resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) all large-scale driftnets are marked at appropriate intervals in a manner that conclusively identifies the vessel and flag nation responsible for each such driftnet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the taking of nontarget fish species, marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds, and endangered species or other species protected by international agreements to which the United States is a party is minimized and does not pose a threat to existing fisheries or the long-term health of living marine resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) definitive steps are agreed upon to ensure that parties to the agreement comply with the spirit of other international agreements and resolutions concerning the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than January 1, 1991, and every year thereafter until the purposes of this section are met, the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) describing the steps taken to carry out the provisions of this section, particularly subsection (c) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) evaluating the progress of those efforts, the impacts on living marine resources, including available observer data, and specifying plans for further action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) containing a list and description of any new fisheries developed by nations that conduct, or authorize their nationals to conduct, large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) containing a list of the nations that conduct, or authorize their nationals to conduct, large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation in a manner that diminishes the effectiveness of or is in<!-- PDFPage:1886 -->consistent with any international agreement governing large-scale driftnet fishing to which the United States is a party or otherwise subscribes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If at any time the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, identifies any nation that warrants inclusion in the list described under subsection (e)(4) of this section, the Secretary shall certify that fact to the President. Such certification shall be deemed to be a certification for the purposes of section 1978(a) of title 22.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect on sovereign rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not serve or be construed to expand or diminish the sovereign rights of the United States, as stated by Presidential Proclamation Numbered 5030, dated March 10, 1983, and reflected in this chapter or other existing law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &ldquo;Living marine resources&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;living marine resources&rdquo; includes fish, marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds and other waterfowl.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas is highly destructive to the living marine resources and <!-- PDFPage:1888 -->ocean ecosystems of the world's oceans, including anadromous fish and other living marine resources of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The cumulative effects of large-scale driftnet fishing pose a significant threat to the marine ecosystem, and slow-reproducing species like marine mammals, sharks, and seabirds may require many years to recover.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Members of the international community have reviewed the best available scientific data on the impacts of large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing, and have failed to conclude that this practice has no significant adverse impacts which threaten the conservation and sustainable management of living marine resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United Nations, via General Assembly Resolutions numbered 44&ndash;225, 45&ndash;197, and most recently 46&ndash;215 (adopted on December 20, 1991), has called for a worldwide moratorium on all high seas driftnet fishing by December 31, 1992, in all the world's oceans, including enclosed seas and semi-enclosed seas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The United Nations has commended the unilateral, regional, and international efforts undertaken by members of the international community and international organizations to implement and support the objectives of the General Assembly resolutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Operative paragraph (4) of United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46&ndash;215 specifically &lsquo;encourages all members of the international community to take measures individually and collectively to prevent large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing operations on the high seas of the world's oceans and seas&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The United States, in section 307(1)(M) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857(1)(M)), has specifically prohibited the practice of large-scale driftnet fishing by United States nationals and vessels both within the exclusive economic zone of the United States and beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Senate, through Senate Resolution 396 of the One Hundredth Congress (approved on March 18, 1988), has called for a moratorium on fishing in the Central Bering Sea and the United States has taken concrete steps to implement such moratorium through international negotiations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Despite the continued evidence of a decline in the fishery resources of the Bering Sea and the multiyear cooperative negotiations undertaken by the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan, and other concerned fishing nations, some nations refuse to agree to measures to reduce or eliminate unregulated fishing practices in the waters of the Bering Sea beyond the exclusive economic zones of the United States and the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) In order to ensure that the global moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing called for in United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46&ndash;215 takes effect by December 31, 1992, and that unregulated fishing practices in the waters of the Central Bering Sea are reduced or eliminated, the United States should take the actions described in this Act [see Short Title of 1992 Amendments note set out under section 1801 of this title] and encourage other nations to take similar action.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the stated policy of the United States to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) implement United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46&ndash;215, approved unanimously on December 20, 1991, which calls for an immediate cessation to further expansion of large-scale driftnet fishing, a 50 percent reduction in existing large-scale driftnet fishing effort by June 30, 1992, and a global moratorium on the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation by December 31, 1992;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) bring about a moratorium on fishing in the Central Bering Sea, or an international conservation and management agreement to which the United States and the Russian Federation are parties that regulates fishing in the Central Bering Sea; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) secure a permanent ban on the use of destructive fishing practices, and in particular large-scale driftnets, by persons or vessels fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, and in cooperation with relevant fishery management councils and any relevant advisory committees, shall take actions to improve the effectiveness of international fishery management organizations in conserving and managing fish stocks under their jurisdiction. These actions shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) urging international fishery management organizations to which the United States is a member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to incorporate multilateral market-related measures against member or nonmember governments whose vessels engage in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to seek adoption of lists that identify fishing vessels and vessel owners engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing that can be shared among all members and other international fishery management organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to seek international adoption of a centralized vessel monitoring system in order to monitor and document capacity in fleets of all nations involved in fishing in areas under an international fishery management organization's jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to increase use of observers and technologies needed to monitor compliance with conservation and management measures established by the organization, including vessel monitoring systems and automatic identification systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to seek adoption of stronger port state controls in all nations, particularly those nations in whose ports vessels engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing land or transship fish;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) urging international fishery management organizations to which the United States is a member, as well as all members of those organizations, to adopt and expand the use of market-related measures to combat illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) import prohibitions, landing restrictions, or other market-based measures needed to enforce compliance with international fishery management organization measures, such as quotas and catch limits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) import restrictions or other market-based measures to prevent the trade or importation of fish caught by vessels identified multilaterally as engaging in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) catch documentation and certification schemes to improve tracking and identification of catch of vessels engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing, including advance transmission of catch documents to ports of entry; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) urging other nations at bilateral, regional, and international levels, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora and the World Trade Organization to take all steps necessary, consistent with international law, to adopt measures and policies that will prevent fish or other living marine resources harvested by vessels engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing from being traded or imported into their nation or territories.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Conservation and management measures shall not discriminate between residents of different States. If it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various United States fishermen, such allocation shall be (A) fair and equitable to all such fishermen; (B) reasonably calculated to promote conservation; and (C) carried out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, consider efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources; except that no such measure shall have economic allocation as its sole purpose.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1896 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Conservation and management measures shall take into account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, fishery resources, and catches.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Conservation and management measures shall, consistent with the conservation requirements of this chapter (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data that meet the requirements of paragraph (2), in order to (A) provide for the sustained participation of such communities, and (B) to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, (A) minimize bycatch and (B) to the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such bycatch.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the spouse, minor child, or partner of that individual; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rebuilding overfished fisheries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall report annually to the Congress and the Councils on the status of fisheries within each Council's geographical area of authority and identify those fisheries that are overfished or are approaching a condition of being overfished. For those fisheries managed under a fishery management plan or international agreement, the status shall be determined using the criteria for overfishing specified in such plan or agreement. A fishery shall be classified as approaching a condition of being overfished if, based on trends in fishing effort, fishery resource size, and other appropriate factors, the Secretary estimates that the fishery will become overfished within two years.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1927 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines at any time that a fishery is overfished, the Secretary shall immediately notify the appropriate Council and request that action be taken to end overfishing in the fishery and to implement conservation and management measures to rebuild affected stocks of fish. The Secretary shall publish each notice under this paragraph in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 2 years after an identification under paragraph (1) or notification under paragraphs (2) or (7), the appropriate Council (or the Secretary, for fisheries under section 1852(a)(3) of this title) shall prepare and implement a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations for the fishery to which the identification or notice applies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to end overfishing immediately in the fishery and to rebuild affected stocks of fish; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prevent overfishing from occurring in the fishery whenever such fishery is identified as approaching an overfished condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For a fishery that is overfished, any fishery management plan, amendment, or proposed regulations prepared pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (5) for such fishery shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify a time period for rebuilding the fishery that shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be as short as possible, taking into account the status and biology of any overfished stocks of fish, the needs of fishing communities, recommendations by international organizations in which the United States participates, and the interaction of the overfished stock of fish within the marine ecosystem; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not exceed 10 years, except in cases where the biology of the stock of fish, other environmental conditions, or management measures under an international agreement in which the United States participates dictate otherwise;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) allocate both overfishing restrictions and recovery benefits fairly and equitably among sectors of the fishery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for fisheries managed under an international agreement, reflect traditional participation in the fishery, relative to other nations, by fishermen of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, within the 2-year period beginning on the date of identification or notification that a fishery is overfished, the Council does not submit to the Secretary a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary shall prepare a fishery management plan or plan amendment and any accompanying regulations to stop overfishing and rebuild affected stocks of fish within 9 months under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) During the development of a fishery management plan, a plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by this subsection, the Council may request the Secretary to implement interim measures to reduce overfishing under section 1855(c) of this title until such measures can be replaced by such plan, amendment, or regulations. Such measures, if otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, may be implemented even though they are not sufficient by themselves to stop overfishing of a fishery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall review any fishery management plan, plan amendment, or regulations required by this subsection at routine intervals that may not exceed two years. If the Secretary finds as a result of the review that such plan, amendment, or regulations have not resulted in adequate progress toward ending overfishing and rebuilding affected fish stocks, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a fishery to which section 1852(a)(3) of this title applies, immediately make revisions necessary to achieve adequate progress; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for all other fisheries, immediately notify the appropriate Council. Such notification shall recommend further conservation and management measures which the Council should consider under paragraph (3) to achieve adequate progress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Fisheries under authority of more than one Council</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) ensure that conservation and management measures under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) promote international conservation of the affected fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) take into consideration traditional fishing patterns of fishing vessels of the United States and the operating requirements of the fisheries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) are fair and equitable in allocating fishing privileges among United States fishermen and do not have economic allocation as the sole purpose; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) promote, to the extent practicable, implementation of scientific research programs that include the tagging and release of Atlantic highly migratory species.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain fish excluded from &ldquo;bycatch&rdquo; definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1802(2) of this title, fish harvested in a commercial fishery managed by the Secretary under this subsection or the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 (16 U.S.C. 971d), or highly migratory species harvested in a commercial fishery managed by a Council under this chapter or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act [16 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.], that are not regulatory discards and that are tagged and released alive under a scientific tagging and release program established by the Secretary shall not be considered bycatch for purposes of this chapter.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as extending or diminishing the jurisdiction or authority of any State within its boundaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the jurisdiction and authority of a State shall extend&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to any pocket of waters that is adjacent to the State and totally enclosed by lines delimiting the territorial sea of the United States pursuant to the Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone or any successor convention to which the United States is a party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the body of water commonly known as Nantucket Sound, to the pocket of water west of the seventieth meridian west of Greenwich; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to the waters of southeastern Alaska (for the purpose of regulating fishing for other than any species of crab) that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) north of the line representing the international boundary at Dixon Entrance and the westward extension of that line; east of 138 degrees west longitude; and not more than three nautical miles seaward from the coast, from the lines extending from headland to headland across all bays, inlets, straits, passes, sounds, and entrances, and from any island or group of islands, including the islands of the Alexander Archipelago (except Forrester Island); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) between the islands referred to in clause (i) (except Forrester Island) and the mainland.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State may regulate a fishing vessel outside the boundaries of the State in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The fishing vessel is registered under the law of that State, and (i) there is no fishery <!-- PDFPage:1941 -->management plan or other applicable Federal fishing regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is operating; or (ii) the State's laws and regulations are consistent with the fishery management plan and applicable Federal fishing regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is operating.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The fishery management plan for the fishery in which the fishing vessel is operating delegates management of the fishery to a State and the State's laws and regulations are consistent with such fishery management plan. If at any time the Secretary determines that a State law or regulation applicable to a fishing vessel under this circumstance is not consistent with the fishery management plan, the Secretary shall promptly notify the State and the appropriate Council of such determination and provide an opportunity for the State to correct any inconsistencies identified in the notification. If, after notice and opportunity for corrective action, the State does not correct the inconsistencies identified by the Secretary, the authority granted to the State under this subparagraph shall not apply until the Secretary and the appropriate Council find that the State has corrected the inconsistencies. For a fishery for which there was a fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996 that did not delegate management of the fishery to a State as of that date, the authority provided by this subparagraph applies only if the Council approves the delegation of management of the fishery to the State by a three-quarters majority vote of the voting members of the Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The fishing vessel is not registered under the law of the State of Alaska and is operating in a fishery in the exclusive economic zone off Alaska for which there was no fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996, and the Secretary and the North Pacific Council find that there is a legitimate interest of the State of Alaska in the conservation and management of such fishery. The authority provided under this subparagraph shall terminate when a fishery management plan under this chapter is approved and implemented for such fishery.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the fishing in a fishery, which is covered by a fishery management plan implemented under this chapter, is engaged in predominately within the exclusive economic zone and beyond such zone; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any State has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, the results of which will substantially and adversely affect the carrying out of such fishery management plan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall promptly notify such State and the appropriate Council of such finding and of his intention to regulate the applicable fishery within the boundaries of such State (other than its internal waters), pursuant to such fishery management plan and the regulations promulgated to implement such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary, pursuant to this subsection, assumes responsibility for the regulation of any fishery, the State involved may at any time thereafter apply to the Secretary for reinstatement of its authority over such fishery. If the Secretary finds that the reasons for which he assumed such regulation no longer prevail, he shall promptly terminate such regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the State involved requests that a hearing be held pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall conduct such hearing prior to taking any action under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception regarding foreign fish processing in internal waters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A foreign fishing vessel may engage in fish processing within the internal waters of a State if, and only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the vessel is qualified for purposes of this paragraph pursuant to paragraph (4)(C) or has received a permit under section 1824(d) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owner or operator of the vessel applies to the Governor of the State for, and (subject to paragraph (2)) is granted, permission for the vessel to engage in such processing and the application specifies the species to be processed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the owner or operator of the vessel submits reports on the tonnage of fish received from vessels of the United States and the locations from which such fish were harvested, in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary by regulation shall prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Governor of a State may not grant permission for a foreign fishing vessel to engage in fish processing under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for a fishery which occurs in the waters of more than one State or in the exclusive economic zone, except after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) consulting with the appropriate Council and Marine Fisheries Commission, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) considering any comments received from the Governor of any other State where the fishery occurs; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Governor determines that fish processors within the State have adequate capacity, and will utilize such capacity, to process all of the United States harvested fish from the fishery concerned that are landed in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection may be construed as relieving a foreign fishing vessel from the duty to comply with all applicable Federal and State laws while operating within the internal waters of a State incident to permission obtained under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;fish processing&rdquo; includes, in addition to processing, the performance of any other activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, or transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The phrase &ldquo;internal waters of a State&rdquo; means all waters within the boundaries of a State except those seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A foreign fishing vessel shall be treated as qualified for purposes of paragraph (1) if the foreign nation under which it is flagged will be a party to (i) a governing international fishery agreement or (ii) a treaty described in section <!-- PDFPage:1942 -->1821(b) of this title during the time the vessel will engage in the fish processing for which permission is sought under paragraph (1)(B).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1858. Civil penalties and permit sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assessment of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have committed an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary, or his designee, by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, and such other matters as justice may require. In assessing such penalty the Secretary may also consider any information provided by the violator relating to the ability of the violator to pay, <em>Provided</em>, That the information is served on the Secretary at least 30 days prior to an administrative hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review of civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under subsection (a) of this section or against whom a permit sanction is imposed under subsection (g) of this section (other than a permit suspension for nonpayment of penalty or fine) may obtain review thereof in the United States district court for the appropriate district by filing a complaint against the Secretary in such court within 30 days from the date of such order. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such penalty imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court if they are not found to be supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action upon failure to pay assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appro<!-- PDFPage:1946 -->priate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) In rem jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fishing vessel (including its fishing gear, furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used in the commission of an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title shall be liable in rem for any civil penalty assessed for such violation under this section and may be proceeded against in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof. Such penalty shall constitute a maritime lien on such vessel which may be recovered in an action in rem in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction over the vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Compromise or other action by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Subpenas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of conducting any hearing under this section, the Secretary may issue subpenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, and may administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt or refusal to obey a subpena served upon any person pursuant to this subsection, the district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business, upon application by the United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony before the Secretary or to appear and produce documents before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Permit sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which (A) a vessel has been used in the commission of an act prohibited under section 1857 of this title, (B) the owner or operator of a vessel or any other person who has been issued or has applied for a permit under this chapter has acted in violation of section 1857 of this title, (C) any amount in settlement of a civil forfeiture imposed on a vessel or other property, or any civil penalty or criminal fine imposed on a vessel or owner or operator of a vessel or any other person who has been issued or has applied for a permit under any marine resource law enforced by the Secretary has not been paid and is overdue, or (D) any payment required for observer services provided to or contracted by an owner or operator who has been issued a permit or applied for a permit under any marine resource law administered by the Secretary has not been paid and is overdue, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) revoke any permit issued with respect to such vessel or person, with or without prejudice to the issuance of subsequent permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) suspend such permit for a period of time considered by the Secretary to be appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) deny such permit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) impose additional conditions and restrictions on any permit issued to or applied for by such vessel or person under this chapter and, with respect to foreign fishing vessels, on the approved application of the foreign nation involved and on any permit issued under that application.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In imposing a sanction under this subsection, the Secretary shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts for which the sanction is imposed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Transfer of ownership of a vessel, by sale or otherwise, shall not extinguish any permit sanction that is in effect or is pending at the time of transfer of ownership. Before executing the transfer of ownership of a vessel, by sale or otherwise, the owner shall disclose in writing to the prospective transferee the existence of any permit sanction that will be in effect or pending with respect to the vessel at the time of the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of any permit that is suspended under this subsection for nonpayment of a civil penalty or criminal fine, the Secretary shall reinstate the permit upon payment of the penalty or fine and interest thereon at the prevailing rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No sanctions shall be imposed under this subsection unless there has been a prior opportunity for a hearing on the facts underlying the violation for which the sanction is imposed, either in conjunction with a civil penalty proceeding under this section or otherwise.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Fisheries disaster relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the discretion of the Secretary or at the request of the Governor of an affected State or a fishing community, the Secretary shall determine whether there is a commercial fishery failure due to a fishery resource disaster as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) natural causes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) man-made causes beyond the control of fishery managers to mitigate through conservation and management measures, including regulatory restrictions (including those imposed as a result of judicial action) imposed to protect human health or the marine environment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) undetermined causes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1953 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the determination under paragraph (1) that there is a commercial fishery failure, the Secretary is authorized to make sums available to be used by the affected State, fishing community, or by the Secretary in cooperation with the affected State or fishing community for assessing the economic and social effects of the commercial fishery failure, or any activity that the Secretary determines is appropriate to restore the fishery or prevent a similar failure in the future and to assist a fishing community affected by such failure. Before making funds available for an activity authorized under this section, the Secretary shall make a determination that such activity will not expand the size or scope of the commercial fishery failure in that fishery or into other fisheries or other geographic regions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Federal share of the cost of any activity carried out under the authority of this subsection shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of that activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as are necessary for each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2013.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fishing capacity reduction program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, at the request of the appropriate Council for fisheries under the authority of such Council, the Governor of a State for fisheries under State authority, or a majority of permit holders in the fishery, may conduct a voluntary fishing capacity reduction program (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;program&rdquo;) in a fishery if the Secretary determines that the program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is necessary to prevent or end overfishing, rebuild stocks of fish, or achieve measurable and significant improvements in the conservation and management of the fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is consistent with the Federal or State fishery management plan or program in effect for such fishery, as appropriate, and that the fishery management plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will prevent the replacement of fishing capacity removed by the program through a moratorium on new entrants, practicable restrictions on vessel upgrades, and other effort control measures, taking into account the full potential fishing capacity of the fleet; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) establishes a specified or target total allowable catch or other measures that trigger closure of the fishery or adjustments to reduce catch; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is cost-effective and, in the instance of a program involving an industry fee system, prospectively capable of repaying any debt obligation incurred under section 53735 of title 46.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The objective of the program shall be to obtain the maximum sustained reduction in fishing capacity at the least cost and in a minimum period of time. To achieve that objective, the Secretary is authorized to pay&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the owner of a fishing vessel, if the permit authorizing the participation of the vessel in the fishery is surrendered for permanent revocation and the vessel owner and permit holder relinquish any claim associated with the vessel or permit that could qualify such owner or holder for any present or future limited access system permit in the fishery for which the program is established or in any other fishery and such vessel is (i) scrapped, or (ii) through the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, subjected to title restrictions (including loss of the vessel's fisheries endorsement) that permanently prohibit and effectively prevent its use in fishing in federal&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1861a_1_target" name="1861a_1">1</a></sup> or state&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1861a_1_target" name="1861a_1">1</a></sup> waters, or fishing on the high seas or in the waters of a foreign nation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the holder of a permit authorizing participation in the fishery, if such permit is surrendered for permanent revocation, and such holder relinquishes any claim associated with the permit and vessel used to harvest fishery resources under the permit that could qualify such holder for any present or future limited access system permit in the fishery for which the program was established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Participation in the program shall be voluntary, but the Secretary shall ensure compliance by all who do participate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The harvester proponents of each program and the Secretary shall consult, as appropriate and practicable, with Councils, Federal agencies, State and regional authorities, affected fishing communities, participants in the fishery, conservation organizations, and other interested parties throughout the development and implementation of any program under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Payment condition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not make a payment under paragraph (2) with respect to a vessel that will not be scrapped unless the Secretary certifies that the vessel will not be used for fishing in the waters of a foreign nation or fishing on the high seas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Report.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary shall, within 12 months after January 12, 2007, submit to the Congress a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) identifying and describing the 20 fisheries in United States waters with the most severe examples of excess harvesting capacity in the fisheries, based on value of each fishery and the amount of excess harvesting capacity as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) recommending measures for reducing such excess harvesting capacity, including the retirement of any latent fishing permits that could contribute to further excess harvesting capacity in those fisheries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) potential sources of funding for such measures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Basis for recommendations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall base the recommendations made with respect to a fishery on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the most cost effective means of achieving voluntary reduction in capacity for the fishery using the potential for industry financing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) including measures to prevent the capacity that is being removed from the fishery from moving to other fisheries in the United States, in the waters of a foreign nation, or on the high seas.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1954 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The program may be funded by any combination of amounts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) available under clause (iv) of section 713c&ndash;3(b)(1)(A) of title 15;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) appropriated for the purposes of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provided by an industry fee system established under subsection (d) of this section and in accordance with section 53735 of title 46; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provided from any State or other public sources or private or non-profit organizations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All funds for the program, including any fees established under subsection (d) of this section, shall be paid into the fishing capacity reduction fund established under section 53735 of title 46.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Industry fee system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) If an industry fee system is necessary to fund the program, the Secretary may conduct a referendum on such system. Prior to the referendum, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) identify, to the extent practicable, and notify all permit or vessel owners who would be affected by the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) make available to such owners information about the industry fee system describing the schedule, procedures, and eligibility requirements for the referendum, the proposed program, and the amount and duration and any other terms and conditions of the proposed fee system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The industry fee system shall be considered approved if the referendum votes which are cast in favor of the proposed system constitute at least a majority of the permit holders in the fishery, or 50 percent of the permitted allocation of the fishery, who participated in the fishery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding section 1854(d) of this title and consistent with an approved industry fee system, the Secretary is authorized to establish such a system to fund the program and repay debt obligations incurred pursuant to section 53735 of title 46. The fees for a program established under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be determined by the Secretary and adjusted from time to time as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to repay such debt obligations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not exceed 5 percent of the ex-vessel value of all fish harvested from the fishery for which the program is established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be deducted by the first ex-vessel fish purchaser from the proceeds otherwise payable to the seller and accounted for and forwarded by such fish purchasers to the Secretary in such manner as the Secretary may establish, unless the Secretary determines that such fees should be collected from the seller; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be in effect only until such time as the debt obligation has been fully paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Implementation plan</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Framework regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall propose and adopt framework regulations applicable to the implementation of all programs under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Program regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall implement each program under this section by promulgating regulations that, together with the framework regulations, establish each program and control its implementation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Harvester proponents&rsquo; implementation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not propose implementation regulations for a program to be paid for by an industry fee system until the harvester proponents of the program provide to the Secretary a proposed implementation plan that, among other matters&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) proposes the types and numbers of vessels or permits that are eligible to participate in the program and the manner in which the program shall proceed, taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the requirements of the framework regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the characteristics of the fishery and affected fishing communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the requirements of the applicable fishery management plan and any amendment that such plan may require to support the proposed program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the general needs and desires of harvesters in the fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) the need to minimize program costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) other matters, including the manner in which such proponents propose to fund the program to ensure its cost effectiveness, as well as any relevant factors demonstrating the potential for, or necessary to obtain, the support and general cooperation of a substantial number of affected harvesters in the fishery (or portion of the fishery) for which the program is intended; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) proposes procedures for program participation (such as submission of owner bids under an auction system or fair market-value assessment), including any terms and conditions for participation, that the harvester proponents deem to be reasonably necessary to meet the program's proposed objectives.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Participation contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall contract with each person participating in a program, and each such contract shall, in addition to including such other matters as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to effectively implement each program (including penalties for contract non-performance) be consistent with the framework and implementing regulations and all other applicable law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reduction auctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each program not involving fair market assessment shall involve a reduction auction that scores the reduction price of each bid offer by the data relevant to each bidder under an appropriate fisheries productivity factor. If the Secretary accepts bids, the Secretary shall accept responsive bids in the rank order of their bid scores, starting with the bid whose <!-- PDFPage:1955 -->reduction price is the lowest percentage of the productivity factor, and successively accepting each additional responsive bid in rank order until either there are no more responsive bids or acceptance of the next bid would cause the total value of bids accepted to exceed the amount of funds available for the program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Bid invitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each program shall proceed by the Secretary issuing invitations to bid setting out the terms and conditions for participation consistent with the framework and implementing regulations. Each bid that the Secretary receives in response to the invitation to bid shall constitute an irrevocable offer from the bidder.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) meet the requirements of section 9701(b) of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 60 days after receiving a plan or plan amendment from the North Pacific Council under this section, the Secretary shall review such plan or plan amendment and either (A) remand such plan or plan amendment to the Council with comments if it does not meet the requirements of this section, or (B) publish in the Federal Register proposed regulations for implementing such plan or plan amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the 60-day public comment period, the Secretary shall conduct a public hearing in each State represented on the Council for the purpose of receiving public comments on the proposed regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 45 days of the close of the public comment period, the Secretary, in consultation with the Council, shall analyze the public comment received and publish final regulations for implementing such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary remands a plan or plan amendment to the Council for failure to meet the requirements of this section, the Council may resubmit such plan or plan amendment at any time after taking action the Council believes will address the defects identified by the Secretary. Any plan or plan amendment resubmitted to the Secretary will be treated as an original plan submitted to the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fishery Observer Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established in the Treasury a North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund. The Fund shall be available, without appropriation or fiscal year limitation, only to the Secretary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section, subject to the restrictions in subsection (b)(2) of this section. The Fund shall consist of <!-- PDFPage:1957 -->all monies deposited into it in accordance with this section. Sums in the Fund that are not currently needed for the purposes of this section shall be kept on deposit or invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special provisions regarding observers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall review&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the feasibility of establishing a risk sharing pool through a reasonable fee, subject to the limitations of subsection (b)(2)(E) of this section, to provide coverage for vessels and owners against liability from civil suits by observers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the availability of comprehensive commercial insurance for vessel and owner liability against civil suits by observers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines that a risk sharing pool is feasible, the Secretary shall establish such a pool, subject to the provisions of subsection (b)(2) of this section, unless the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) comprehensive commercial insurance is available for all fishing vessels and United States fish processors required to have observers under the provisions of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such comprehensive commercial insurance will provide a greater measure of coverage at a lower cost to each participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Bycatch reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In implementing section 1853(a)(11) of this title and this section, the North Pacific Council shall submit conservation and management measures to lower, on an annual basis for a period of not less than four years, the total amount of economic discards occurring in the fisheries under its jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Bycatch reduction incentives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding section 1854(d) of this title, the North Pacific Council may submit, and the Secretary may approve, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, a system of fines in a fishery to provide incentives to reduce bycatch and bycatch rates; except that such fines shall not exceed $25,000 per vessel per season. Any fines collected shall be deposited in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund, and may be made available by the Secretary to offset costs related to the reduction of bycatch in the fishery from which such fines were derived, including conservation and management measures and research, and to the State of Alaska to offset costs incurred by the State in the fishery from which such penalties were derived or in fisheries in which the State is directly involved in management or enforcement and which are directly affected by the fishery from which such penalties were derived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding section 1853(d) of this title, and in addition to the authority provided in section 1853(b)(10) of this title, the North Pacific Council may submit, and the Secretary may approve, conservation and management measures which provide allocations of regulatory discards to individual fishing vessels as an incentive to reduce per vessel bycatch and bycatch rates in a fishery, <em>Provided</em>, That&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such allocations may not be transferred for monetary consideration and are made only on an annual basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any such conservation and management measures will meet the requirements of subsection (h) of this section and will result in an actual reduction in regulatory discards in the fishery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The North Pacific Council may submit restrictions in addition to the restriction imposed by clause (i) of subparagraph (A) on the transferability of any such allocations, and the Secretary may approve such recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Catch measurement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) By June 1, 1997 the North Pacific Council shall submit, and the Secretary may approve, consistent with the other provisions of this chapter, conservation and management measures to ensure total catch measurement in each fishery under the jurisdiction of such Council. Such measures shall ensure the accurate enumeration, at a minimum, of target species, economic discards, and regulatory discards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the extent the measures submitted under paragraph (1) do not require United States fish processors and fish processing vessels (as defined in chapter 21 of title 46) to weigh fish, the North Pacific Council and the Secretary shall submit a plan to the Congress by January 1, 1998, to allow for weighing, including recommendations to assist such processors and processing vessels in acquiring necessary equipment, unless the Council determines that such weighing is not necessary to meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Full retention and utilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The North Pacific Council shall submit to the Secretary by October 1, 1998 a report on the advisability of requiring the full retention by fishing vessels and full utilization by United States fish processors of economic discards in fisheries under its jurisdiction if such economic discards, or the mortality of such economic discards, cannot be avoided. The report shall address the projected impacts of such requirements on participants in the fishery and describe any full retention and full utilization requirements that have been implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The report shall address the advisability of measures to minimize processing waste, including standards setting minimum percentages which must be processed for human consumption. For the purpose of the report, &ldquo;processing waste&rdquo; means that portion of any fish which is processed and which could be used for human consumption or other commercial use, but which is not so used.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab rationalization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) By not later than January 1, 2005, the Secretary shall approve and hereafter&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1862_2_target" name="1862_2">2</a></sup> implement by regulation the Voluntary Three-Pie Cooperative Program for crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands approved by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council between June 2002 and April 2003, and all trailing amendments including those reported to Congress on May 6, 2003. This section shall not preclude the Secretary from approving by January 1, 2005, and <!-- PDFPage:1958 -->implementing any subsequent program amendments approved by the Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in carrying out paragraph (1) the Secretary shall approve all parts of the Program referred to in such paragraph. Further, no part of such Program may be implemented if, as approved by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, individual fishing quotas, processing quotas, community development quota allocation, voluntary cooperatives, binding arbitration, regional landing and processing requirements, community protections, economic data collection, or the loan program for crab fishing vessel captains and crew members, is invalidated subject to a judicial determination not subject to judicial appeal. If the Secretary determines that a processor has leveraged its Individual Processor Quota shares to acquire a harvesters open-delivery &ldquo;B shares&rdquo;, the processor's Individual Processor Quota shares shall be forfeited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subsequent to implementation pursuant to paragraph (1), the Council may submit and the Secretary may implement changes to or repeal of conservation and management measures, including measures authorized in this section, for crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands in accordance with applicable law, including this chapter as amended by this subsection, to achieve on a continuing basis the purposes identified by the Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The loan program referred to in paragraph (2) shall be carried out pursuant to the authority of sections 53735 and 53702(b) of title 46.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of implementing this section $1,000,000 shall be made available each year until fully implemented from funds otherwise made available to the National Marine Fisheries Service for Alaska fisheries activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this chapter shall constitute a waiver, either express or implied, of the antitrust laws of the United States. The Secretary, in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, shall develop and implement a mandatory information collection and review process to provide any and all information necessary for the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether any illegal acts of anti-competition, anti-trust, or price collusion have occurred among persons receiving individual processing quotas under the Program. The Secretary may revoke any individual processing quota held by any person found to have violated a provision of the antitrust laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) An individual processing quota issued under the Program shall be considered a permit for the purposes of sections 1857, 1858, and 1859 of this title, and may be revoked or limited at any time in accordance with this chapter. Issuance of an individual processing quota under the program shall not confer any right of compensation to the holder of such individual processing quota if it is revoked or limited and shall not create, or be construed to create, any right, title, or interest in or to any fish before the fish is purchased from an individual fishing quota holder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The restriction on the collection of economic data in section 1853 of this title shall not apply with respect to any fish processor who is eligible for, or who has received, individual processing quota under the Program. The restriction on the disclosure of information in section 1881a(b)(1) of this title shall not apply when the information is used to determine eligibility for or compliance with an individual processing quota program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The provisions of sections 1858, 1860, and 1861 of this title shall apply to the processing facilities and fish products of any person holding individual processing quota, and the provisions of subparagraphs (D), (E), and (L) of section 1857(<em>l</em>)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1862_3_target" name="1862_3">3</a></sup> of this title shall apply to any facility owned or controlled by a person holding individual processing quota.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Collection programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Council requests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a Council determines that additional information would be beneficial for developing, implementing, or revising a fishery management plan or for determining whether a fishery is in need of management, the Council may request that the Secretary implement an information collection program for the fishery which would provide the types of information specified by the Council. The Secretary shall undertake such an information collection program if he determines that the need is justified, and shall promulgate regulations to implement the program within 60 days after such determination is made. If the Secretary determines that the need for an information collection program is not justified, the Secretary shall inform the Council of the reasons for such determination in writing. The determinations of the Secretary under this paragraph regarding a Council request shall be made within a reasonable period of time after receipt of that request.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Secretarial initiation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) when required by court order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) when such information is used by State, Council, or Marine Fisheries Commission employees to verify catch under a limited access program, but only to the extent that such use is consistent with subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) when the Secretary has obtained written authorization from the person submitting such information to release such information to persons for reasons not otherwise provided for in this subsection, and such release does not violate other requirements of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) when such information is required to be submitted to the Secretary for any determination under a limited access program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) in support of homeland and national security activities, including the Coast Guard's homeland security missions as defined in section 468(a)(2) of title 6.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any observer information shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed, except in accordance with the requirements of subparagraphs (A) through (H) of paragraph (1), or&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as authorized by a fishery management plan or regulations under the authority of the North Pacific Council to allow disclosure to the public of weekly summary bycatch information identified by vessel or for haul-specific bycatch information without vessel identification;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when such information is necessary in proceedings to adjudicate observer certifications; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as authorized by any regulations issued under paragraph (3) allowing the collection of observer information, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement between the observers, observer employers, and the Secretary prohibiting disclosure of the information by the observers or observer employers, in order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to allow the sharing of observer information among observers and between observers and observer employers as necessary to train and prepare observers for deployments on specific vessels; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to validate the accuracy of the observer information collected.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall, by regulation, prescribe such procedures as may be necessary to preserve the confidentiality of information submitted in compliance with any requirement or regulation under this chapter, except that the Secretary may release or make public any such information in any aggregate or summary form which does not directly or indirectly disclose the identity or business of any person who submits such information. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted or construed to prevent the use for conservation and management purposes by the Secretary, or with the approval of the Secretary, the Council, of any information submitted in compliance with any requirement or regulation under this chapter or the use, release, or publication of bycatch information pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restriction on use of certain information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to restrict the use, in civil enforcement or criminal proceedings under this chapter, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), and the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), of information collected by voluntary fishery data collectors, including sea samplers, while aboard any vessel for conservation and management purposes if the presence of such a fishery data collector aboard is not required by any of such chapter or Acts or regulations thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not require the submission of a Federal or State income tax return or statement as a prerequisite for issuance of a permit until such time as the Secretary has promulgated regulations to ensure the confidentiality of information contained in such return or statement, to limit the information submitted to that necessary to achieve a demonstrated conservation and management purpose, and to provide appropriate penalties for violation of such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contracting authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may provide a grant, contract, or other financial assistance on a sole-source basis to a State, Council, or Marine Fisheries Commission for the purpose of carrying out information collection or other programs if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the recipient of such a grant, contract, or other financial assistance is specified by statute to be, or has customarily been, such State, Council, or Marine Fisheries Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary has entered into a cooperative agreement with such State, Council, or Marine Fisheries Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Resource assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may use the private sector to provide vessels, equipment, and services necessary to survey the fishery resources of the United States when the arrangement will yield statistically reliable results.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, in consultation with the appropriate Council and the fishing industry&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may structure competitive solicitations under paragraph (1) so as to compensate a contractor for a fishery resources survey by allowing the contractor to retain for sale fish harvested during the survey voyage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a survey during which the quantity or quality of fish harvested is not expected to be adequately compensatory, may structure those solicitations so as to provide <!-- PDFPage:1966 -->that compensation by permitting the contractor to harvest on a subsequent voyage and retain for sale a portion of the allowable catch of the surveyed fishery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may permit fish harvested during such survey to count toward a vessel's catch history under a fishery management plan if such survey was conducted in a manner that precluded a vessel's participation in a fishery that counted under the plan for purposes of determining catch history.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall undertake efforts to expand annual fishery resource assessments in all regions of the Nation.</p>
