<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by improving, maintaining and managing existing conservation activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible land</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exclusions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Land enrolled in other conservation programs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the land had previously been enrolled in the conservation reserve program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the land has been maintained using long-term crop rotation practices, as determined by the Secretary; or</p>
