The text of a proposed charter shall include provisions setting forth procedures for providing refunds to those sector participants subject to assessment under section 4012 of this title, and may also include provisions which establish a maximum limit on the amount that any one sector participant may be required to pay under an assessment for any period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the members of the council shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in performing their duties as members of the council.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of charter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 180 days of the receipt of an application to establish a council, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) determine if the proposed charter is consistent with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any negative determination is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection regarding a proposed charter, the Secretary shall advise in writing the sector participants who made the application of the reasons for such determination.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Conduct of referendum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon making affirmative determinations under subsection (d)(1) of this section regarding a proposed charter, the Secretary, within 90 days after the date of the last of such determinations, shall conduct a referendum on the adoption of the proposed charter among all sector participants identified in accordance with subsection (d)(1)(A) of this section. The Secretary shall by order establish the council and approve the proposed charter, if the referendum votes which are cast in favor of the proposed charter constitute a majority of the sector participants voting in each sector and the majority collectively accounts for, in the twelve-month period immediately preceding the month in which the proposed charter was filed under subsection (a) of this section, at least sixty-six percent of the value of the fish and fish products described in accordance with subsection (b)(3) of this section that were handled by that sector during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not less than thirty days prior to holding a referendum under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) publish (by such means as will result in wide publicity in regions affected by the proposed charter) the text of the proposed charter and a list of those sector participants eligible to vote in the referendum; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall pay all costs of a referendum which establishes a council under this subsection. Within two years after a council <!-- PDFPage:1933 -->is established the council shall reimburse the Secretary for any expenses incurred for the conduct of the referendum from assessments collected by the council. Prior to the holding of a referendum under this subsection, the Secretary shall require the applicants to post a bond or other security acceptable to the Secretary, in an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient to pay any expenses incurred for the conduct of the referendum, and shall immediately recover such amount if a referendum fails to result in the establishment of a council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;expenses incurred for the conduct of the referendum&rdquo; does not include salaries of Government employees or other administrative overhead, but is limited to those additional direct costs incurred in connection with conduct of the referendum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nominations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within thirty days after a council is established under subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary shall solicit from the sectors represented on the council nominations for members of the council. If the harvesters and receivers represented on the council are engaged in business in two or more regions of the United States, the nominations made under this paragraph, and the appointments to the council made under paragraph (3) of this subsection, must, to the extent practicable, result in equitable representation for the constituent regions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No person is eligible for nomination or appointment as a member of a council unless such person is knowledgeable and experienced with regard to the activities of, and is or has been actively engaged in the business of, the sector which such person will represent on the council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall, within sixty days after the end of the thirty-day period referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, appoint the members of the council from among the nominees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A vacancy on a council shall be filled, within sixty days after the vacancy occurs, in the same manner in which the original appointment was made. A member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring before the expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall be appointed only for the remainder of such term.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall remove any member of a council if the council concerned first recommends, by not less than two-thirds of its members, removal for cause. Such a recommendation of a council must be in writing and accompanied by a statement of the reasons upon which the recommendation is based.</p>
