<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1801. Findings, purposes and policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The fish off the coasts of the United States, the highly migratory species of the high seas, the species which dwell on or in the Continental Shelf appertaining to the United States, and the anadromous species which spawn in United States rivers or estuaries, constitute valuable and renewable natural resources. These fishery resources contribute to the food supply, economy, and health of the Nation and provide recreational opportunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Certain stocks of fish have declined to the point where their survival is threatened, and other stocks of fish have been so substantially reduced in number that they could become similarly threatened as a consequence of (A) increased fishing pressure, (B) the inadequacy of fishery resource conservation and management practices and controls, or (C) direct and indirect habitat losses which have resulted in a diminished capacity to support existing fishing levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Commercial and recreational fishing constitutes a major source of employment and contributes significantly to the economy of the Nation. Many coastal areas are dependent upon fishing and related activities, and their economies have been badly damaged by the overfishing of fishery resources at an ever-increasing rate over the past decade. The activities of massive foreign fishing fleets in waters adjacent to such coastal areas have contributed to such damage, interfered with domestic fishing efforts, and caused destruction of the fishing gear of United States fishermen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) International fishery agreements have not been effective in preventing or terminating the overfishing of these valuable fishery resources. There is danger that irreversible effects from overfishing will take place before an effective international agreement on fishery management jurisdiction can be negotiated, signed, ratified, and implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Fishery resources are finite but renewable. If placed under sound management before overfishing has caused irreversible effects, the fisheries can be conserved and maintained so as to provide optimum yields on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A national program for the conservation and management of the fishery resources of the United States is necessary to prevent overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, to insure conservation, to facilitate long-term protection of essential fish habitats, and to realize the full potential of the Nation's fishery resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A national program for the development of fisheries which are underutilized or not utilized by the United States fishing industry, including bottom fish off Alaska, is necessary to assure that our citizens benefit from the employment, food supply, and revenue which could be generated thereby.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The collection of reliable data is essential to the effective conservation, management, and scientific understanding of the fishery resources of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) One of the greatest long-term threats to the viability of commercial and recreational fisheries is the continuing loss of marine, estuarine, and other aquatic habitats. Habitat considerations should receive increased attention for the conservation and management of fishery resources of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Pacific Insular Areas contain unique historical, cultural, legal, political, and geographical circumstances which make fisheries resources important in sustaining their economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) A number of the Fishery Management Councils have demonstrated significant progress in integrating ecosystem considerations in fisheries management using the existing authorities provided under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) International cooperation is necessary to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and other fishing practices which may harm the sustainability of living marine resources and disadvantage the United States fishing industry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore declared to be the purposes of the Congress in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to take immediate action to conserve and manage the fishery resources found off the coasts of the United States, and the anadromous species and Continental Shelf fishery resources of the United States, by exercising (A) sovereign rights for the purposes of exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing all fish, within the exclusive economic zone established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated March 10, 1983, and (B) exclusive fishery management authority beyond the exclusive economic zone over such anadromous species and Continental Shelf fishery resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to support and encourage the implementation and enforcement of international fishery agreements for the conservation and management of highly migratory species, and to encourage the negotiation and implementation of additional such agreements as necessary;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1853 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to promote domestic commercial and recreational fishing under sound conservation and management principles, including the promotion of catch and release programs in recreational fishing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide for the preparation and implementation, in accordance with national standards, of fishery management plans which will achieve and maintain, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish Regional Fishery Management Councils to exercise sound judgment in the stewardship of fishery resources through the preparation, monitoring, and revision of such plans under circumstances (A) which will enable the States, the fishing industry, consumer and environmental organizations, and other interested persons to participate in, and advise on, the establishment and administration of such plans, and (B) which take into account the social and economic needs of the States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to encourage the development by the United States fishing industry of fisheries which are currently underutilized or not utilized by United States fishermen, including bottom fish off Alaska, and to that end, to ensure that optimum yield determinations promote such development in a non-wasteful manner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to promote the protection of essential fish habitat in the review of projects conducted under Federal permits, licenses, or other authorities that affect or have the potential to affect such habitat.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further declared to be the policy of the Congress in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to maintain without change the existing territorial or other ocean jurisdiction of the United States for all purposes other than the conservation and management of fishery resources, as provided for in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to authorize no impediment to, or interference with, recognized legitimate uses of the high seas, except as necessary for the conservation and management of fishery resources, as provided for in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to assure that the national fishery conservation and management program utilizes, and is based upon, the best scientific information available; involves, and is responsive to the needs of, interested and affected States and citizens; considers efficiency; draws upon Federal, State, and academic capabilities in carrying out research, administration, management, and enforcement; considers the effects of fishing on immature fish and encourages development of practical measures that minimize bycatch and avoid unnecessary waste of fish; and is workable and effective;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to permit foreign fishing consistent with the provisions of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to support and encourage active United States efforts to obtain internationally acceptable agreements which provide for effective conservation and management of fishery resources, and to secure agreements to regulate fishing by vessels or persons beyond the exclusive economic zones of any nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to foster and maintain the diversity of fisheries in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to ensure that the fishery resources adjacent to a Pacific Insular Area, including resident or migratory stocks within the exclusive economic zone adjacent to such areas, be explored, developed, conserved, and managed for the benefit of the people of such area and of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body">In par. (49), &ldquo;section 70502(c) of title 46&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;section 3(c) of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1903(c))&rdquo; on authority of Pub. L. 109&ndash;304, &sect;18(c), Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1709, which Act enacted section 70502 of Title 46, Shipping.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;251, &sect;301(b), which directed amendment of this section by adding a new par. (24) defining &ldquo;special areas&rdquo; and redesignating former pars. (24) to (32) as (25) to (33), respectively, was to be effective on the date on which the Agreement between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Maritime Boundary, signed June 1, 1990, enters into force for United States, but will not be executed, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because the amendments would be inconsistent with the amendments by Pub. L. 104&ndash;297 which added par. (36) (now par. (41)) which is substantially identical to the par. (24) added by Pub. L. 102&ndash;251, made successive redesignations of pars. (2) to (44), and added and amended various other pars. See 1996 Amendment notes below and section 308 of Pub.
