<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The fish off the coasts of the United States, the highly migratory species of the high seas, the species which dwell on or in the Continental Shelf appertaining to the United States, and the anadromous species which spawn in United States rivers or estuaries, constitute valuable and renewable natural resources. These fishery resources contribute to the food supply, economy, and health of the Nation and provide recreational opportunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) As a consequence of increased fishing pressure and because of the inadequacy of fishery conservation and management practices and controls (A) certain stocks of such fish have been overfished to the point where their survival is threatened, and (B) other such stocks have been so substantially reduced in number that they could become similarly threatened.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Commercial and recreational fishing constitutes a major source of employment and contributes significantly to the economy of the Nation. Many coastal areas are dependent upon fishing and related activities, and their economies have been badly damaged by the overfishing of fishery resources at an ever-increasing rate over the past decade. The activities of massive foreign fishing fleets in waters adjacent to such coastal areas have contributed to such damage, interfered with domestic fishing efforts, and caused destruction of the fishing gear of United States fishermen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) International fishery agreements have not been effective in preventing or terminating the overfishing of these valuable fishery resources. There is danger that irreversible effects from overfishing will take place before an effective international agreement on fishery management jurisdiction can be negotiated, signed, ratified, and implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Fishery resources are finite but renewable. If placed under sound management before overfishing has caused irreversible effects, the fisheries can be conserved and maintained so as to provide optimum yields on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A national program for the conservation and management of the fishery resources of the United States is necessary to prevent overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, to insure conservation, and to realize the full potential of the Nation's fishery resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A national program for the development of fisheries which are underutilized or not utilized by the United States fishing industry, including bottom fish off Alaska, is necessary to assure that our citizens benefit from the employment, food supply, and revenue which could be generated thereby.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The collection of reliable data is essential to the effective conservation, management, and scientific understanding of the fishery resources of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore declared to be the purposes of the Congress in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to take immediate action to conserve and manage the fishery resources found off the coasts of the United States, and the anadromous species and Continental Shelf fishery resources of the United States, by exercising (A) sovereign rights for the purposes of exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing all fish, within the exclusive economic zone established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated March 10, 1983, and (B) exclusive fishery management authority beyond the exclusive economic zone over such anadromous species and Continental Shelf fishery resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to support and encourage the implementation and enforcement of international fish<!-- PDFPage:1556 -->ery agreements for the conservation and management of highly migratory species, and to encourage the negotiation and implementation of additional such agreements as necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to promote domestic commercial and recreational fishing under sound conservation and management principles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide for the preparation and implementation, in accordance with national standards, of fishery management plans which will achieve and maintain, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish Regional Fishery Management Councils to exercise sound judgment in the stewardship of fishery resources through the preparation, monitoring, and revision of such plans under circumstances (A) which will enable the States, the fishing industry, consumer and environmental organizations, and other interested persons to participate in, and advise on, the establishment and administration of such plans, and (B) which take into account the social and economic needs of the States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to encourage the development by the United States fishing industry of fisheries which are currently underutilized or not utilized by United States fishermen, including bottom fish off Alaska, and to that end, to ensure that optimum yield determinations promote such development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further declared to be the policy of the Congress in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to maintain without change the existing territorial or other ocean jurisdiction of the United States for all purposes other than the conservation and management of fishery resources, as provided for in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to authorize no impediment to, or interference with, recognized legitimate uses of the high seas, except as necessary for the conservation and management of fishery resources, as provided for in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to assure that the national fishery conservation and management program utilizes, and is based upon, the best scientific information available; involves, and is responsive to the needs of, interested and affected States and citizens; promotes efficiency; draws upon Federal, State, and academic capabilities in carrying out research, administration, management, and enforcement; considers the effects of fishing on immature fish and encourages development of practical measures that avoid unnecessary waste of fish; and is workable and effective;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to permit foreign fishing consistent with the provisions of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to support and encourage active United States efforts to obtain internationally acceptable agreements which provide for effective conservation and management of fishery resources, and to secure agreements to regulate fishing by vessels or persons beyond the exclusive economic zones of any nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to foster and maintain the diversity of fisheries in the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) identifying recreational fishing opportunities that are limited by water quality and habitat degradation and promoting restoration to support viable, healthy, and, where feasible, self-sustaining recreational fisheries;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) fostering sound aquatic conservation and restoration endeavors to benefit recreational fisheries;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) providing access to and promoting awareness of opportunities for public participation and enjoyment of U.S. recreational fishery resources;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) supporting outreach programs designed to stimulate angler participation in the conservation and restoration of aquatic systems;</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) implementing laws under their purview in a manner that will conserve, restore, and enhance aquatic systems that support recreational fisheries;</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) establishing cost-share programs, under existing authorities, that match or exceed Federal funds with nonfederal contributions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) evaluating the effects of Federally funded, permitted, or authorized actions on aquatic systems and recreational fisheries and document those effects relative to the purpose of this order; and</p>
