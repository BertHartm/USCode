<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sale offers; hardship from delay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In exercising his authority to acquire property under this subchapter, the Secretary shall give immediate and careful consideration to any offer made by an individual owning property within the lakeshore to sell such property to the Secretary. In considering any such offer, the Secretary shall take into consideration any hardship to the owner which might result from any undue delay in acquiring his property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State donations; transfer from Federal agency to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any property or interests therein, owned by the State of Michigan, or any political subdivisions thereof, may be acquired only by donation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal property located within such area may, with the concurrence of the agency having custody thereof, be transferred without consideration to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for use by him in carrying out the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Negotiation and purchase; condemnation proceedings; fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make every reasonable effort to acquire property through negotiation and purchase. Where agreement is not reached and condemnation proceedings are filed, the owner of such property shall be paid the fair market value thereof as determined in such proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Condemnation to acquire clear, marketable and encumbrance-free title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prohibit the use of condemnation as a means <!-- PDFPage:607 -->of acquiring a clear and marketable title, free of any and all encumbrances.</p>

The values of the properties so exchanged either shall be approximately equal or, if they are not approximately equal, the values shall be equalized by the payment of cash to the grantor or to the Secretary as the circumstances require.</p>
