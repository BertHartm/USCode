The Secretary shall not convey any such interest to a State, another public agency or other entity unless the Secretary determines that such State, agency or other entity is committed to undertake the management of the property being transferred in accordance with the objectives of this chapter, and the deed or other instrument of transfer contains provisions for the reversion of title to the property to the United States if such State, agency or other entity fails to manage the property in accordance with the objectives of this chapter. Any real property interest conveyed pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to such terms and conditions that will ensure that the interest will be administered for the long-term conservation and management of the wetland ecosystem and the fish and wildlife dependent thereon.</p>
