<p class="note-body">Subtitle E of title XII of the Food Security Act, comprising this subchapter, was originally enacted by Pub.

L. 104&ndash;127, title III, &sect;341, Apr. 4, 1996, 110 Stat. 1007, without reference to the intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of the subtitle's provisions by Pub. L. 104&ndash;127. Subsequently, subtitle E was amended by Pub. L. 107&ndash;171 to add new sections 3841, 3842, and 3844 and to repeal former sections 3841 and 3842.</p>
