<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a forest land enhancement program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide financial assistance to State foresters; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to encourage the long-term sustainability of nonindustrial private forest lands in the United States by assisting the owners of nonindustrial private forest lands, through State foresters, in more actively managing the nonindustrial private forest lands and related resources of those owners through the use of State, Federal, and private sector resource management expertise, financial assistance, and educational programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination and consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, acting through State foresters, shall implement the program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in coordination with the State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in consultation with other Federal, State, and local natural resource management agencies, institutions of higher education, and a broad range of private sector interests.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In implementing the program, the Secretary shall target resources to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Investing in practices to establish, restore, protect, manage, maintain, and enhance <!-- PDFPage:1929 -->the health and productivity of the nonindustrial private forest lands in the United States for timber, habitat for flora and fauna, soil, water, and air quality, wetlands, and riparian buffers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Ensuring that afforestation, reforestation, improvement of poorly stocked stands, timber stand improvement, practices necessary to improve seedling growth and survival, and growth enhancement practices occur where needed to enhance and sustain the long-term productivity of timber and nontimber forest resources to help meet future public demand for all forest resources and provide environmental benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Reducing the risks and helping restore, recover, and mitigate the damage to forests caused by fire, insects, invasive species, disease, and damaging weather.</p>
