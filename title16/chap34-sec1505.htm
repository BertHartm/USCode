<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contracting authority of Secretary; duration of contracts; eligibility and duties of producers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of any other title, the Secretary may establish multiyear set-aside contracts for a period not to extend beyond the 1981 crop. Such contracts may be entered into only as a part of the programs in effect for wheat, feed grains, and cotton for the years 1974 through 1982, and only producers participating in one or more of such programs shall be eligible to contract with the Secretary under this section. Producers agreeing to a multiyear set-aside agreement shall be required to devote this acreage to vegetative cover capable of maintaining itself throughout such period to provide soil protection, water quality enhancement, wildlife production, and natural beauty. Grazing of livestock under this section shall be prohibited, except in areas of a major disaster as determined by the President if the Secretary finds there is a need therefor, as a result of such disaster. Producers entering into agreements under this section shall also agree to comply with all applicable State and local law and regulation governing noxious weed control.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cost-sharing incentives for farm operators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide cost-sharing incentives to farm operators for such cover establishment, whenever a multiyear contract is entered into on all or a portion of the set-aside acreage.</p>
