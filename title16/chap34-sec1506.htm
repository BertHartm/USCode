<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall issue such regulations as he determines necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. The total acreage placed under agreements which result in their retirement from production in any county or local community shall in addition to the limitations elsewhere in this chapter be limited to a percentage of the total eligible acreage in such county or local community which the Secretary determines would not adversely affect the economy of the county or local community. In determining such percentage the Secretary shall give appropriate consideration to the productivity of the acreage being retired, if any, as compared to the average productivity of eligible acreage in such county or local community which the Secretary determines would not adversely affect the economy of the county or local community.</p>
