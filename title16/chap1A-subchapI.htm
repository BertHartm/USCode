<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) is authorized to conduct a survey of sites which he deems exhibit qualities most appropriate for the commemoration of each former President of the United States. The survey may include sites associated with the deeds, leadership, or lifework of a former President, and it may identify sites or <!-- PDFPage:699 -->structures historically unrelated to a former President but which may be suitable as a memorial to honor such President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preparation and transmittal to Congressional committees of reports on individual sites and structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, from time to time, prepare and transmit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate reports on individual sites and structures identified in the survey referred to in subsection (a) of this section, together with his recommendation as to whether such site or structure is suitable for establishment as a national historic site or national memorial to commemorate a former President. Each such report shall include pertinent information with respect to the need for acquisition of lands and interests therein, the development of facilities, and the operation and maintenance of the site or structure and the estimated cost thereof. If during the six-month period following the transmittal of a report pursuant to this subsection neither Committee has by vote of a majority of its members disapproved a recommendation of the Secretary that a site or structure is suitable for establishment as a national historic site, the Secretary may thereafter by appropriate order establish the same as a national historic site, including the lands and interests therein identified in the report accompanying his recommendation. The Secretary may acquire the lands and interests therein by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, transfer from any other Federal agency, or exchange, and he shall administer the site in accordance with sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this title, as amended and supplemented, and sections 461 to 467 of this title, as amended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibited statutory constructions</h4>
