The program shall serve as an update and expansion of the State nonpoint source management program developed under section 1329 of title 33, as the program under that section relates to land and water uses affecting coastal waters.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State program under this section shall provide for the implementation, at a minimum, of management measures in conformity with the guidance published under subsection (g) of this section, to protect coastal waters generally, and shall also contain the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Identifying land uses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The identification of, and a continuing process for identifying, land uses which, individually or cumulatively, may cause or contribute significantly to a degradation of&mdash;</p>
