<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Through the 2012 fiscal year, the Secretary shall formulate and carry out a conservation reserve program under which land is enrolled through the use of contracts to assist owners and operators of land specified in subsection (b) of this section to conserve and improve the soil, water, and wildlife resources of such land and to address issues raised by State, regional, and national conservation initiatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the program established under this subpart&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) highly erodible cropland that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) if permitted to remain untreated could substantially reduce the agricultural production capability for future generations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) cannot be farmed in accordance with a plan that complies with the requirements of subchapter II of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines had a cropping history or was considered to be planted for 4 of the 6 years preceding the date of enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (except for land enrolled in the conservation reserve program as of that date);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) marginal pasture land converted to wetland or established as wildlife habitat prior to November 28, 1990;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) marginal pasture land to be devoted to appropriate vegetation, including trees, in or near riparian areas, or devoted to similar water quality purposes (including marginal pastureland converted to wetland or established as wildlife habitat);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) cropland that is otherwise ineligible if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if permitted to remain in agricultural production, the land would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) contribute to the degradation of soil, water, or air quality; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) pose an on-site or off-site environmental threat to soil, water, or air quality;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the land is a&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the land poses an off-farm environmental threat, or a threat of continued degradation of productivity due to soil salinity, if permitted to remain in production; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enrollment of the land would facilitate a net savings in groundwater or surface water resources of the agricultural operation of the producer; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the portion of land in a field not enrolled in the conservation reserve in a case in which more than 50 percent of the land in the field is enrolled as a buffer, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the land is enrolled as part of the buffer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the remainder of the field is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) during the crop year or during any of the 2 years preceding the crop year, the land was enrolled in the water bank program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contract of the owner or operator of the cropland expired or will expire in calendar year 2000, 2001, or 2002.</p>
