<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and providing for reorganizations in the Securities and Exchange Commission. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is not practicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) That the project adopted, including the maps, plans, and specifications, shall be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement and utilization of water-power development, for the adequate protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat), and for other beneficial public uses, including irrigation, flood control, water supply, and recreational and other purposes referred to in section 797(e) of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#803_1_target" name="803_1">1</a></sup> if necessary in order to secure such plan the Commission shall have <!-- PDFPage:1267 -->authority to require the modification of any project and of the plans and specifications of the project works before approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to ensure that the project adopted will be best adapted to the comprehensive plan described in paragraph (1), the Commission shall consider each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The extent to which the project is consistent with a comprehensive plan (where one exists) for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway or waterways affected by the project that is prepared by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) an agency established pursuant to Federal law that has the authority to prepare such a plan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the State in which the facility is or will be located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The recommendations of Federal and State agencies exercising administration over flood control, navigation, irrigation, recreation, cultural and other relevant resources of the State in which the project is located, and the recommendations (including fish and wildlife recommendations) of Indian tribes affected by the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In the case of a State or municipal applicant, or an applicant which is primarily engaged in the generation or sale of electric power (other than electric power solely from cogeneration facilities or small power production facilities), the electricity consumption efficiency improvement program of the applicant, including its plans, performance and capabilities for encouraging or assisting its customers to conserve electricity cost-effectively, taking into account the published policies, restrictions, and requirements of relevant State regulatory authorities applicable to such applicant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon receipt of an application for a license, the Commission shall solicit recommendations from the agencies and Indian tribes identified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) for proposed terms and conditions for the Commission's consideration for inclusion in the license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Alterations in project works</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">That except when emergency shall require for the protection of navigation, life, health, or property, no substantial alteration or addition not in conformity with the approved plans shall be made to any dam or other project works constructed hereunder of an installed capacity in excess of two thousand horsepower without the prior approval of the Commission; and any emergency alteration or addition so made shall thereafter be subject to such modification and change as the Commission may direct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maintenance and repair of project works; liability of licensee for damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">That the licensee shall maintain the project works in a condition of repair adequate for the purposes of navigation and for the efficient operation of said works in the development and transmission of power, shall make all necessary renewals and replacements, shall establish and maintain adequate depreciation reserves for such purposes, shall so maintain, and operate said works as not to impair navigation, and shall conform to such rules and regulations as the Commission may from time to time prescribe for the protection of life, health, and property. Each licensee hereunder shall be liable for all damages occasioned to the property of others by the construction, maintenance, or operation of the project works or of the works appurtenant or accessory thereto, constructed under the license and in no event shall the United States be liable therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amortization reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">That after the first twenty years of operation, out of surplus earned thereafter, if any, accumulated in excess of a specified reasonable rate of return upon the net investment of a licensee in any project or projects under license, the licensee shall establish and maintain amortization reserves, which reserves shall, in the discretion of the Commission, be held until the termination of the license or be applied from time to time in reduction of the net investment. Such specified rate of return and the proportion of such surplus earnings to be paid into and held in such reserves shall be set forth in the license. For any new license issued under section 808 of this title, the amortization reserves under this subsection shall be maintained on and after the effective date of such new license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Annual charges payable by licensees; maximum rates; application; review and report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) That the licensee shall pay to the United States reasonable annual charges in an amount to be fixed by the Commission for the purpose of reimbursing the United States for the costs of the administration of this subchapter, including any reasonable and necessary costs incurred by Federal and State fish and wildlife agencies and other natural and cultural resource agencies in connection with studies or other reviews carried out by such agencies for purposes of administering their responsibilities under this subchapter; for recompensing it for the use, occupancy, and enjoyment of its lands or other property; and for the expropriation to the Government of excessive profits until the respective States shall make provision for preventing excessive profits or for the expropriation thereof to themselves, or until the period of amortization as herein provided is reached, and in fixing such charges the Commission shall seek to avoid increasing the price to the consumers of power by such charges, and any such charges may be adjusted from time to time by the Commission as conditions may require: <em>Provided</em>, That, subject to annual appropriations Acts, the portion of such annual charges imposed by the Commission under this subsection to cover the reasonable and necessary costs of such agencies shall be available to such agencies (in addition to other funds appropriated for such purposes) solely for carrying out such studies and reviews and shall remain available until expended: <em>Provided</em>, That when licenses are issued involving the use of Government dams or other structures owned by the United States or tribal lands embraced within Indian reservations the Commission shall, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior in the case of such dams or structures in reclamation projects and, in the case of such tribal lands, subject to the approval of the In<!-- PDFPage:1268 -->dian tribe having jurisdiction of such lands as provided in section 476 of title 25, fix a reasonable annual charge for the use thereof, and such charges may with like approval be readjusted by the Commission at the end of twenty years after the project is available for service and at periods of not less than ten years thereafter upon notice and opportunity for hearing: <em>Provided further</em>, That licenses for the development, transmission, or distribution of power by States or municipalities shall be issued and enjoyed without charge to the extent such power is sold to the public without profit or is used by such State or municipality for State or municipal purposes, except that as to projects constructed or to be constructed by States or municipalities primarily designed to provide or improve navigation, licenses therefor shall be issued without charge; and that licenses for the development, transmission, or distribution of power for domestic, mining, or other beneficial use in projects of not more than two thousand horsepower installed capacity may be issued without charge, except on tribal lands within Indian reservations; but in no case shall a license be issued free of charge for the development and utilization of power created by any Government dam and that the amount charged therefor in any license shall be such as determined by the Commission: <em>Provided however</em>, That no charge shall be assessed for the use of any Government dam or structure by any licensee if, before January 1, 1985, the Secretary of the Interior has entered into a contract with such licensee that meets each of the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The contract covers one or more projects for which a license was issued by the Commission before January 1, 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The contract contains provisions specifically providing each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) A powerplant may be built by the licensee utilizing irrigation facilities constructed by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The powerplant shall remain in the exclusive control, possession, and ownership of the licensee concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) All revenue from the powerplant and from the use, sale, or disposal of electric energy from the powerplant shall be, and remain, the property of such licensee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The contract is an amendatory, supplemental and replacement contract between the United States and: (i) the Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District (Contract No. 14&ndash;06&ndash;100&ndash;6418); (ii) the East Columbia Basin Irrigation District (Contract No. 14&ndash;06&ndash;100&ndash;6419); or, (iii) the South Columbia Basin Irrigation District (Contract No. 14&ndash;06&ndash;100&ndash;6420).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Combinations, agreements, arrangements, or understandings, express or implied, to limit the output of electrical energy, to restrain trade, or to fix, maintain, or increase prices for electrical energy or service are hereby prohibited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) That conduct under the license that: (A) results in the contravention of the policies expressed in the antitrust laws; and (B) is not otherwise justified by the public interest considering regulatory policies expressed in other applicable law (including but not limited to those contained in subchapter II of this chapter) shall be prevented or adequately minimized by means of conditions included in the license prior to its issuance. In the event it is impossible to prevent or adequately minimize the contravention, the Commission shall refuse to issue any license to the applicant for the project and, in the case of an existing project, shall take appropriate action to provide thereafter for the operation and maintenance of the affected project and for the issuing of a new license in accordance with section 808 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Waiver of conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In issuing licenses for a minor part only of a complete project, or for a complete project of not more than two thousand horsepower installed capacity, the Commission may in its discretion waive such conditions, provisions, and requirements of this subchapter, except the license period of fifty years, as it may deem to be to the public interest to waive under the circumstances: <em>Provided</em>, That the provisions hereof shall not apply to annual charges for use of lands within Indian reservations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the Commission believes that any recommendation referred to in paragraph (1) may be inconsistent with the purposes and requirements of this subchapter or other applicable law, the Commission and the agencies referred to in paragraph (1) shall attempt to resolve any such inconsistency, giving due weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities of such agencies. If, after such attempt, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a recommendation of any such agency, the Commission shall publish each of the following findings (together with a statement of the basis for each of the findings):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A finding that adoption of such recommendation is inconsistent with the purposes and requirements of this subchapter or with other applicable provisions of law.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Relicensing procedures; terms and conditions; issuance to applicant with proposal best adapted to serve public interest; factors considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the United States does not, at the expiration of the existing license, exercise its right to take over, maintain, and operate any project or projects of the licensee, as provided in section 807 of this title, the commission is authorized to issue a new license to the existing licensee upon such terms and conditions as may be authorized or required under the then existing laws and regulations, or to issue a new license under said terms and conditions to a new licensee, which license may cover any project or projects covered by the existing license, and shall be issued on the condition that the new licensee shall, before taking possession of such project or projects, pay such amount, and assume such contracts as the United States is required to do in the manner specified in section 807 of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That in the event the United States does not exercise the right to take over or does not issue a license to a new licensee, or issue a new license to the existing licensee, upon reasonable terms, then the commission shall issue from year to year an annual license to the then licensee under the terms and conditions of the existing license until the property is taken over or a new license is issued as aforesaid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any new license issued under this section shall be issued to the applicant having the final proposal which the Commission determines is best adapted to serve the public interest, except that in making this determination the Commission shall ensure that insignificant differences with regard to subparagraphs (A) through (G) of this paragraph between competing applications are not determinative and shall not result in the transfer of a project. In making a determination under this section (whether or not more than one application is submitted for the project), the Commission shall, in addition to the requirements of section 803 of this title, consider (and explain such consideration in writing) each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The plans and abilities of the applicant to comply with (i) the articles, terms, and conditions of any license issued to it and (ii) other applicable provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The plans of the applicant to manage, operate, and maintain the project safely.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The plans and abilities of the applicant to operate and maintain the project in a manner most likely to provide efficient and reliable electric service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The need of the applicant over the short and long term for the electricity generated by the project or projects to serve its customers, including, among other relevant considerations, the reasonable costs and reasonable availability of alternative sources of power, taking into consideration conservation and other relevant factors and taking into consideration the effect on the provider (including its customers) of the alternative source of power, the effect on the applicant's operating and load characteristics, the effect on communities served or to be served by the project, and in the case of an applicant using power for the applicant's own industrial facility and related operations, the effect on the operation and efficiency of such facility or related operations, its workers, and the related community. In the case of an applicant that is an Indian tribe applying for a license for a project located on the tribal reservation, a statement of the need of such tribe for electricity generated by the project to foster the purposes of the reservation may be included.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The existing and planned transmission services of the applicant, taking into consideration system reliability, costs, and other applicable economic and technical factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Whether the plans of the applicant will be achieved, to the greatest extent possible, in a cost effective manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Such other factors as the Commission may deem relevant, except that the terms and conditions in the license for the protection, mitigation, or enhancement of fish and wildlife resources affected by the development, operation, and management of the project shall be determined in accordance with section 803 of this title, and the plans of an applicant concerning fish and wildlife shall not be subject to a comparative evaluation under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1273 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of an application by the existing licensee, the Commission shall also take into consideration each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The existing licensee's record of compliance with the terms and conditions of the existing license.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The actions taken by the existing licensee related to the project which affect the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification of intention regarding renewal; public availability of documents; notice to public and Federal agencies; identification of Federal or Indian lands included; additional information required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each existing licensee shall notify the Commission whether the licensee intends to file an application for a new license or not. Such notice shall be submitted at least 5 years before the expiration of the existing license.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At the time notice is provided under paragraph (1), the existing licensee shall make each of the following reasonably available to the public for inspection at the offices of such licensee: current maps, drawings, data, and such other information as the Commission shall, by rule, require regarding the construction and operation of the licensed project. Such information shall include, to the greatest extent practicable pertinent energy conservation, recreation, fish and wildlife, and other environmental information. Copies of the information shall be made available at reasonable costs of reproduction. Within 180 days after October 16, 1986, the Commission shall promulgate regulations regarding the information to be provided under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Promptly following receipt of notice under paragraph (1), the Commission shall provide public notice of whether an existing licensee intends to file or not to file an application for a new license. The Commission shall also promptly notify the National Marine Fisheries Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the appropriate State fish and wildlife agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall require the applicant to identify any Federal or Indian lands included in the project boundary, together with a statement of the annual fees paid as required by this subchapter for such lands, and to provide such additional information as the Commission deems appropriate to carry out the Commission's responsibilities under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Time of filing application; consultation and participation in studies with fish and wildlife agencies; notice to applicants; adjustment of time periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each application for a new license pursuant to this section shall be filed with the Commission at least 24 months before the expiration of the term of the existing license. Each applicant shall consult with the fish and wildlife agencies referred to in subsection (b) of this section and, as appropriate, conduct studies with such agencies. Within 60 days after the statutory deadline for the submission of applications, the Commission shall issue a notice establishing expeditious procedures for relicensing and a deadline for submission of final amendments, if any, to the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The time periods specified in this subsection and in subsection (b) of this section shall be adjusted, in a manner that achieves the objectives of this section, by the Commission by rule or order with respect to existing licensees who, by reason of the expiration dates of their licenses, are unable to comply with a specified time period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adequacy of transmission facilities; provision of services to successor by existing licensee; tariff; final order; modification, extension or termination of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In evaluating applications for new licenses pursuant to this section, the Commission shall not consider whether an applicant has adequate transmission facilities with regard to the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Commission issues a new license (pursuant to this section) to an applicant which is not the existing licensee of the project and finds that it is not feasible for the new licensee to utilize the energy from such project without provision by the existing licensee of reasonable services, including transmission services, the Commission shall give notice to the existing licensee and the new licensee to immediately enter into negotiations for such services and the costs demonstrated by the existing licensee as being related to the provision of such services. It is the intent of the Congress that such negotiations be carried out in good faith and that a timely agreement be reached between the parties in order to facilitate the transfer of the license by the date established when the Commission issued the new license. If such parties do not notify the Commission that within the time established by the Commission in such notice (and if appropriate, in the judgment of the Commission, one 45-day extension thereof), a mutually satisfactory arrangement for such services that is consistent with the provisions of this chapter has been executed, the Commission shall order the existing licensee to file (pursuant to section 824d of this title) with the Commission a tariff, subject to refund, ensuring such services beginning on the date of transfer of the project and including just and reasonable rates and reasonable terms and conditions. After notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Commission shall issue a final order adopting or modifying such tariff for such services at just and reasonable rates in accordance with section 824d of this title and in accordance with reasonable terms and conditions. The Commission, in issuing such order, shall ensure the services necessary for the full and efficient utilization and benefits for the license term of the electric energy from the project by the new licensee in accordance with the license and this subchapter, except that in issuing such order the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall not compel the existing licensee to enlarge generating facilities, transmit electric energy other than to the distribution system (providing service to customers) of the new licensee identified as of the date one day preceding the date of license award, or require the acquisition of new facilities, including the upgrading of existing facilities other than any reasonable enhancement or improvement of existing facilities controlled by the existing licensee (including any acquisition related to <!-- PDFPage:1274 -->such enhancement or improvement) necessary to carry out the purposes of this paragraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall not adversely affect the continuity and reliability of service to the customers of the existing licensee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall not adversely affect the operational integrity of the transmission and electric systems of the existing licensee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall not cause any reasonably quantifiable increase in the jurisdictional rates of the existing licensee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) shall not order any entity other than the existing licensee to provide transmission or other services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such order shall be for such period as the Commission deems appropriate, not to exceed the term of the license. At any time, the Commission, upon its own motion or upon a petition by the existing or new licensee and after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may modify, extend, or terminate such order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) License term on relicensing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except for an annual license, any license issued by the Commission under this section shall be for a term which the Commission determines to be in the public interest but not less than 30 years, nor more than 50 years, from the date on which the license is issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nonpower use licenses; recordkeeping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In issuing any licenses under this section except an annual license, the Commission, on its own motion or upon application of any licensee, person, State, municipality, or State commission, after notice to each State commission and licensee affected, and after opportunity for hearing, whenever it finds that in conformity with a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for beneficial public uses all or part of any licensed project should no longer be used or adapted for use for power purposes, may license all or part of the project works for nonpower use. A license for nonpower use shall be issued to a new licensee only on the condition that the new licensee shall, before taking possession of the facilities encompassed thereunder, pay such amount and assume such contracts as the United States is required to do, in the manner specified in section 807 of this title. Any license for nonpower use shall be a temporary license. Whenever, in the judgment of the Commission, a State, municipality, interstate agency, or another Federal agency is authorized and willing to assume regulatory supervision of the lands and facilities included under the nonpower license and does so, the Commission shall thereupon terminate the license. Consistent with the provisions of subchapter IV of this chapter, every licensee for nonpower use shall keep such accounts and file such annual and other periodic or special reports concerning the removal, alteration, nonpower use, or other disposition of any project works or parts thereof covered by the nonpower use license as the Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as necessary or appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Monitoring and investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall monitor and investigate compliance with each license and permit issued under this subchapter and with each exemption <!-- PDFPage:1282 -->granted from any requirement of this subchapter. The Commission shall conduct such investigations as may be necessary and proper in accordance with this chapter. After notice and opportunity for public hearing, the Commission may issue such orders as necessary to require compliance with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits issued under this subchapter and with the terms and conditions of exemptions granted from any requirement of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Revocation orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After notice and opportunity for an evidentiary hearing, the Commission may also issue an order revoking any license issued under this subchapter or any exemption granted from any requirement of this subchapter where any licensee or exemptee is found by the Commission:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to have knowingly violated a final order issued under subsection (a) of this section after completion of judicial review (or the opportunity for judicial review); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to have been given reasonable time to comply fully with such order prior to commencing any revocation proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In any such proceeding, the order issued under subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to de novo review by the Commission. No order shall be issued under this subsection until after the Commission has taken into consideration the nature and seriousness of the violation and the efforts of the licensee to remedy the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any licensee, permittee, or exemptee who violates or fails or refuses to comply with any rule or regulation under this subchapter, any term, or condition of a license, permit, or exemption under this subchapter, or any order issued under subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day that such violation or failure or refusal continues. Such penalty shall be assessed by the Commission after notice and opportunity for public hearing. In determining the amount of a proposed penalty, the Commission shall take into consideration the nature and seriousness of the violation, failure, or refusal and the efforts of the licensee to remedy the violation, failure, or refusal in a timely manner. No civil penalty shall be assessed where revocation is ordered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty against any person under this section, the Commission shall provide to such person notice of the proposed penalty. Such notice shall, except in the case of a violation of a final order issued under subsection (a) of this section, inform such person of his opportunity to elect in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice to have the procedures of paragraph (3) (in lieu of those of paragraph (2)) apply with respect to such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of the violation of a final order issued under subsection (a) of this section, or unless an election is made within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice under paragraph (1) to have paragraph (3) apply with respect to such penalty, the Commission shall assess the penalty, by order, after a determination of violation has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant to section 554 of title 5 before an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. Such assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's findings and the basis for such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this paragraph may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the Commission assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United States court of appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in Part,<sup><a href="#823b_1_target" name="823b_1">1</a></sup> the order of the Commission, or the court may remand the proceeding to the Commission for such further action as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the procedures of this paragraph have been elected, the Commission shall promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of the notice under paragraph (1) of the proposed penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the civil penalty has not been paid within 60 calendar days after the assessment order has been made under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall institute an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for an order affirming the assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to review de novo the law and the facts involved, and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in Part,<sup><a href="#823b_1_target" name="823b_1">1</a></sup> such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked except with the consent of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be imposed under this subsection, taking into consideration the nature and seriousness of the violation and the efforts of the licensee to remedy the violation in a timely manner at any time prior to a final decision by the court of appeals under paragraph (2) or by the district court under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (2), or after the appropriate district court has entered final judgment in favor of the Commission under paragraph (3), the Commission shall institute an action to recover the amount of such penalty in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of title 28 or of this chapter, the Commission may be represented by the general counsel of the Commission (or any attorney or attorneys within the Commission designated by the Chairman) <!-- PDFPage:1283 -->who shall supervise, conduct, and argue any civil litigation to which paragraph (3) of this subsection applies (including any related collection action under paragraph (5)) in a court of the United States or in any other court, except the Supreme Court. However, the Commission or the general counsel shall consult with the Attorney General concerning such litigation, and the Attorney General shall provide, on request, such assistance in the conduct of such litigation as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall be represented by the Attorney General, or the Solicitor General, as appropriate, in actions under this subsection, except to the extent provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
