<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Pinelands area in New Jersey, containing approximately 1,000,000 acres of pine-oak forest, extensive surface and ground water resources of high quality, and a wide diversity of rare plant and animal species, provides significant ecological, natural, cultural, recreational, educational, agricultural, and public health benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a national interest in protecting and preserving these benefits for the residents of and visitors to the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a primary responsibility for protecting and enhancing these benefits resides with the State of New Jersey and the various local units of government having jurisdiction over the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in view of the longstanding Federal practice of assisting the States in creating, pro<!-- PDFPage:898 -->tecting, preserving, and enhancing areas of significant regional and urban importance, and in view of the national significance of this resource, the Federal Government has an interest in assisting the State of New Jersey and its local units of government in fulfilling their responsibilities and in avoiding adverse Federally approved or assisted impacts before these responsibilities can be undertaken;</p>

Unless there is a finding by the Secretary of Agriculture that better utilization of the various forest resources (consistent with the provisions of the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 [16 U.S.C. 528&ndash;531]) will result, sales contracts shall be for a period not to exceed ten years: <em>Provided</em>, That such period may be adjusted at the discretion of the Secretary to provide additional time due to time delays caused by an act of an agent of the United States or by other circumstances beyond the control of the purchaser. The Secretary shall require the purchaser to file as soon as practicable after execution of a contract for any advertised sale with a term of two years or more, a plan of operation, which shall be subject to concurrence by the Secretary. The Secretary shall not extend any contract period with an original term of two years or more unless he finds (A) that the purchaser has diligently performed in accordance with an approved plan of operation or (B) that the substantial overriding public interest justifies the extension.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In those instances when the Secretary selects oral auction as the bidding method for the sale of any national forest materials, he shall require that all prospective purchasers submit written sealed qualifying bids. Only prospective purchasers whose written sealed qualifying bids are equal to or in excess of the appraised value of such national forest materials may participate in the oral bidding process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall monitor bidding patterns involved in the sale of national forest materials. If the Secretary has a reasonable belief that collusive bidding practices may be occurring, then&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) he may alter the bidding methods used within the affected area; and</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) for similar purposes, the United States has designated certain adjacent Federal lands, amounting to approximately 379 acres, as the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) this National Forest (managed as part of the Stanislaus National Forest) is the smallest National Forest in the United States and could be more appropriately and efficiently managed as part of the Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this Act is to improve the management of the lands located in the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest, and to protect certain examples of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees, by unifying the management of the lands in such National Forest and in the California Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. LAND CONVEYANCE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Conveyance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to valid existing rights and the provisions of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary&rsquo;) is authorized and directed to convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to lands and interests therein within the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest, as generally depicted on a map numbered 20435 and dated June 5, 1989, prepared by the California Department of Parks and Recreation, to the State of California for inclusion within the Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Map and Description</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As soon as practicable after the enactment of this Act [Oct. 17, 1990], the Secretary shall submit a map and legal description of the lands referred to in subsection (a) to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs [now Committee on Natural Resources] of the United States House of Representatives, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.

Such consideration shall include either lands in California that the Secretary finds suitable for addition to, and are contiguous to, one or more units of the National Forest System, cash payment, or monetary grants awarded to the United States after June 1, 1990, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) No harvest of timber (except as may be necessary for the control of fire, insects, or disease) and no mining, mineral leasing, or geothermal exploration or development shall be permitted on such lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Any action by the State of California to convey any portion of such lands or interests to any entity other than the United States shall be void ab initio and shall result in the reversion to the United States of all right, title, and interest in such lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Any action by the State of California to permit the use of any portion of such lands for any purpose prohibited by this subsection or any purpose incompatible with the continued ability of such lands to support ponderosa pine, sugar pine, or giant sequoia trees, shall result in the reversion of all right, title, and interest in such lands to the United States. Any such lands which revert to the United States shall be incorporated into the Stanislaus National Forest and managed to preserve and protect the stands of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees located on such lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Secretary, acting through the Forest Service, shall be afforded by appropriate officials of the State of California reasonable opportunities to collect seeds from trees located on such lands for scientific or silvicultural purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Secretary, upon prior notification to the State of California, shall be entitled at any time to enter upon such lands for the purpose of monitoring the management of such lands and the compliance of the State of California with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The conveyance shall be subject to the following reservations or exceptions:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) existing ditches and canals as authorized by the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945); and</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the request of the Secretary, the Attorney General shall bring any action or take any other steps necessary to enforce the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Timing, Value, and Status</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Conveyance of lands to the State of California pursuant to this Act shall occur when the agreement described in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) has been reached. The restrictions and conditions specified in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) of subsection (c) shall be included in the instruments of conveyance of lands to the State of California.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Effective upon the conveyance to the State of California of lands described in subsection (a) of this section, or two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 17, 1990], whichever is sooner, the National Forest designation of such lands shall terminate. Any such lands not conveyed to the State of California shall thereupon be incorporated into the Stanislaus National Forest and managed to preserve and protect the stands of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees located on such lands.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Any lands conveyed to the United States pursuant to this Act shall be deemed national forest lands and managed according to the laws governing the management of the National Forest System.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;497c. Ski area permit rental charge</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental charge for all ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b), the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 U.S.C. 497), or the 9th through 20th paragraphs under the heading &ldquo;SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS&rdquo; under the heading &ldquo;UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR&rdquo; in the Act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, chapter 2), on National Forest System lands. Permit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Permit rental charges for existing ski area permits issued pursuant to the Act of March 4, 1915, and the Act of June 4, 1897, shall be calculated in accordance with those existing permits: <em>Provided</em>, That a permittee may, at the permittee's option, use the calculation method set forth in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be calculated by adding the permittee's gross revenues from lift ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from ski school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by the slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest System land. That amount shall be increased by the gross year-round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) physically located on national forest land, including all permittee or subpermittee lodging, food service, rental shops, parking and other ancillary operations, to determine the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental charge. The final rental charge shall be calculated by multiplying the AGR by the following percentages for each revenue bracket and adding the total for each revenue bracket:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below $3,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue that exceeds $50,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection the ski area permit fee (SAPF) formula can be simply illustrated as:</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">SAPF = ((LT + SS) �0A STFP) + GRAF = AGR; AGR&nbsp;�0A&nbsp;%&nbsp;BRACKETS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In cases where ski areas are only partially located on national forest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on national forest land referred to in this subsection shall be calculated as generally described in the Forest Service Manual in effect as of January 1, 1992. Revenues from Nordic ski operations shall be included or excluded from the rental charge calculation according to the percentage of trails physically located on national forest land.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair and equitable to both the United States and the ski area permittees, the adjusted gross revenue figures for each revenue bracket in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted annually by the percent increase or decrease in the national Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year. No later than 3 years after November 12, 1996, and every 5 years thereafter the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives a report analyzing whether the ski area permit rental charge required by this section is returning a fair market value rental to the United States together with any recommendations the Secretary may have for modifications of the system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rental charge set forth in subsection (b) of this section shall be due on June 1 of each year and shall be paid or prepaid by the permittee on a monthly, quarterly, annual or other schedule as determined appropriate by the Secretary in consultation with the permittee. Unless mutually agreed otherwise by the Secretary and the permittee, the payment or prepayment schedule shall conform to the permittee's schedule in effect prior to November 12, 1996. To reduce costs to the permittee and the Forest Service, the Secretary shall each year provide the permittee with a standardized form and worksheets (including annual rental charge calculation brackets and rates) to be used for rental charge calculation and submitted with the rental charge payment. Information provided on such forms shall be compiled by the Secretary annually and kept in the Office of the Chief, United States Forest Service.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition on timber purchaser road credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In financing any forest development road pursuant to section 535 of this title, the Secretary of Agriculture may not provide effective credit for road construction to any purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction of roads by timber purchasers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture makes a determination that a forest development road referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be constructed or paid for, in whole or in part, by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the Secretary shall include notice of the determination in the notice of sale of the timber or other forest products. The notice of sale shall contain, or announce the availability of, sufficient information related to the road described in the notice to permit a prospective bidder on the sale to calculate the likely cost that would be incurred by the bidder to construct or finance the construction of the road so that the bidder may reflect such cost in the bid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If there is an increase or decrease in the cost of roads constructed by the timber purchaser, caused by variations in quantities, changes or modifications subsequent to the sale of timber made in accordance with applicable timber sale contract provisions, then an adjustment to the price paid for timber harvested by the purchaser shall be made. The adjustment shall be applied by the Secretary as soon as practicable after any such design change is implemented.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special election by small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A notice of sale referred to in subsection (b) of this section containing specified road construction of $50,000 or more, shall give a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products that qualifies as a &ldquo;small business concern&rdquo; under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.), and regulations issued thereunder, the option to elect that the Secretary of Agriculture build the roads described in the notice. The Secretary shall provide the small business concern with an estimate of the cost that would be incurred by the Secretary to construct the roads on behalf of the small business concern. The notice of sale shall also include the date on which the roads described in the notice will be completed by the Secretary if the election is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the election referred to in paragraph (1) is made, the purchaser of the national forest timber or other forest products shall pay to the Secretary of Agriculture, in addition to the price paid for the timber or other forest products, an amount equal to the estimated cost of the roads which otherwise would be paid by the purchaser as provided in the notice of sale. Pending receipt of such amount, the Secretary may use receipts from the sale of national forest timber or other forest products and such additional sums as may be appropriated for the construction of roads, such funds to be available until expended, to accomplish the requested road construction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of harvesting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In each sale of national forest timber or other forest products referred to in this section, the Secretary of Agriculture is encouraged to authorize harvest of the timber or other forest products in a unit included in the sale as soon as road work for that unit is completed and the road work is approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Construction standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any forest development road that is to be constructed or paid for by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the Secretary of Agriculture may not require the purchaser to design, construct, or maintain the road (or pay for the design, construction, or <!-- PDFPage:948 -->maintenance of the road) to a standard higher than the standard, consistent with applicable environmental laws and regulations, that is sufficient for the harvesting and removal of the timber or other forest products, unless the Secretary bears that part of the cost necessary to meet the higher standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment of road value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any forest development road that is constructed or paid for by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the estimated cost of the road construction, including subsequent design changes, shall be considered to be money received for purposes of the payments required to be made under section 500 of this title. To the extent that the appraised value of road construction determined under this subsection reflects funds contributed by the Secretary of Agriculture to build the road to a higher standard pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary shall modify the appraisal of the road construction to exclude the effect of the Federal funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) This section and the requirements of this section shall take effect (and apply thereafter) upon the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) April 1, 1999; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date that is the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the effective date of regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to implement this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Subject to appropriations, other applicable law, and the requirements of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;588), except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall, to the extent consistent with providing for the multiple use and sustained yield of all renewable forest resources, seek to provide a supply of timber from the Tongass National Forest which (1) meets the annual market demand for timber from such forest and (2) meets the market demand from such forest for each planning cycle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insured and guaranteed loan program for purchasers of national forests materials in Alaska; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized and directed to establish a special program of insured or guaranteed loans to purchasers of national forest materials in Alaska to assist such purchasers in the acquisition of equipment and the implementation of new technologies which lead to the utilization of wood products which might otherwise not be utilized. The Secretary is authorized to promulgate such regulations as he deems appropriate to define eligibility requirements for the participation in the loan program and the terms and conditions applicable to loans made under the program. Except as otherwise provided in this section or regulations promulgated specifically for this loan program, such program shall be carried out in a manner which is consistent with other authorities available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To carry out the special loan program established by this section, there are hereby authorized beginning after the fiscal year 1980 to be appropriated $5,000,000 from National Forest Fund receipts, to be deposited in a special fund in the Treasury of the United States to remain available until expended. Repayments of principal and interest and other recoveries on loans authorized by this section shall be credited to this fund and shall remain available until expended in order to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Study on increase of timber yields on national forest lands in Alaska; transmittal to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within three years after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall prepare and transmit to the Senate and House of Representatives a study of opportunities (consistent with the laws and regulations applicable to the management of the National Forest System) to increase timber yields on national forest lands in Alaska.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Identification of lands not suited for timber production; consideration of economic factors unnecessary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All provisions of section 6(k) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1604(k)) shall apply to the Tongass National Forest except that the Secretary need not consider economic factors in the identification of lands not suited for timber production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Protection of riparian habitat; maintenance of buffer zones in Tongass National Forest; relocation of prior independent sale or released volume</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure protection of riparian habitat, the Secretary shall maintain a buffer zone of no less than one hundred feet in width on each side of all Class I streams in the Tongass National Forest, and on those Class II streams which flow directly into a Class I stream, within which commercial timber harvesting shall be prohibited, except where independent national forest timber sales have already been sold prior to March 1, 1990, or where volume has been released prior to March 1, 1990, to either the Alaska Pulp Corporation or the Ketchikan Pulp Company pursuant to the long-term timber sale contracts numbered 12&ndash;11&ndash;010&ndash;1545 and A10fs&ndash;1042 respectively. If such an independent timber sale or released volume is within the buffer zone, the Secretary shall make every effort to relocate such independent sale or released volume to an area outside of the buffer zone. The Secretary shall use best management practices, as defined in the Region 10 Soil and Water Conservation handbook&nbsp;<sup><a href="#539d_1_target" name="539d_1">1</a></sup> (FSH 2509.22), January 1990, to assure the protection of riparian habitat on streams or portions of streams not protected by such buffer zones.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) certain parcels of private land located in central and southwest Washington are intermingled with National Forest System land owned by the United States and administered by the Secretary of Agriculture as parts of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Wenatchee National Forest, and Gifford Pinchot National Forest;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the private land surface estate and some subsurface is owned by the Plum Creek Timber Company, L.P. in an intermingled checkerboard pattern, with the United States or Plum Creek owning alternate square mile sections of land or fractions of square mile sections;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the checkerboard land ownership pattern in the area has frustrated sound and efficient land management on both private and National Forest lands by complicating fish and wildlife habitat management, watershed protection, recreation use, road construction and timber harvest, boundary administration, and protection and management of threatened and endangered species and old growth forest habitat;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) acquisition by the United States of certain parcels of land that have been offered by Plum Creek for addition to the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wenatchee National Forest will serve important public objectives, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) enhancement of public access, aesthetics and recreation opportunities within or near areas of very heavy public recreational use including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area;</p>

<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iv) Cle Elum Lake, Kachess Lake and Keechulus Lake; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(v) other popular recreation areas along the Interstate 90 corridor east of the Seattle-Tacoma Metropolitan Area;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) protection and enhancement of old growth forests and habitat for threatened, endangered and sensitive species, including a net gain of approximately 28,500 acres of habitat for the northern spotted owl;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) consolidation of National Forest holdings for more efficient administration and to meet a broad array of ecosystem protection and other public land management goals, including net public gains of approximately 283 miles of stream ownership, 14 miles of the route of the Pacific Crest Trail, 20,000 acres of unroaded land, and 7,360 acres of riparian land; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) a significant reduction in administrative costs to the United States through&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) consolidation of Federal land holdings for more efficient land management and planning;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) elimination of approximately 300 miles of boundary identification and posting;</p>

<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iv) other administrative cost savings;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Plum Creek has selected certain parcels of National Forest System land that are logical for consolidation into Plum Creek ownership utilizing a land exchange because the parcels&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) time is of the essence in consummating a land exchange because delays may force Plum Creek to road or log the offered land and thereby diminish the public values for which the offered land is to be acquired; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) it is in the public interest to complete the land exchange at the earliest practicable date so that the offered land can be acquired and preserved by the United States for permanent public management, use, and enjoyment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this Act to further the public interest by authorizing, directing, facilitating, and expediting the consummation of the Interstate 90 land exchange so as to ensure that the offered land is expeditiously acquired for permanent public use and enjoyment.</p>

The Secretary shall promptly notify the public of adoption of the interim guidelines and transmit the guidelines to each county. Guidelines adopted by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall remain in effect for each county until the Secretary has developed guidelines for the special management areas pursuant to section 544f of this title and the land use ordinances prescribed by section 544e of this title are in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary may acquire by condemnation any land or interest which is being used or threatened to be used in a manner inconsistent with the purposes for which the scenic area was established and which will cause or is likely to cause impacts adversely affecting the scenic, cultural, recreation, and natural resources of the scenic area: <em>Provided</em>, That no lands or interests therein can be acquired by condemnation pursuant to this section if used in the same manner and for the same purposes as used on November 17, 1986, unless such land is used for or interest is in the development of sand, gravel, or crushed rock, or the disposal of refuse: <em>Provided further</em>, That within thirty days of the filing by the Secretary of a complaint for condemnation of any land or interest in the scenic area, outside of the special management areas and urban areas, the Commission, by a vote of two-thirds of its membership including a majority of the members appointed from each State, or if the Commission is not in existence the Governor of the State in which the land or interest is located, may disapprove such proposed complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Upon or after the commencement of any action for condemnation pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary, acting through the Attorney General of the United States, may <!-- PDFPage:996 -->apply to the appropriate United States District Court for a temporary restraining order or injunction to prohibit the use of any property within the scenic area, but outside of urban areas, which will cause or is likely to cause impacts adversely affecting the scenic, cultural, recreation and natural resources of the scenic area or is otherwise inconsistent with the purposes for which the scenic area was established. During the period of such order or injunction, the Secretary shall diligently and in good faith negotiate with the owner of the property to assure that, following termination of the order or injunction, the inconsistent use is abated or the adverse effect is mitigated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of development action</h4>
