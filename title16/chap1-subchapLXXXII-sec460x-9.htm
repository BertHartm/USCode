The Secretary shall pay to the owner the value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the value on such date of the right retained by the owner. Where any such owner retains a right of use and occupancy as herein provided, such right during its existence may be conveyed or leased for noncommercial residential purposes in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Option to retain use of land; notice to Secretary; payment</h4>

Such owner or occupier must notify the Secretary of any intention to exercise such option within 60 days after receipt of the notice referred to in section 460x&ndash;10(c)(3) of this title. In situations where the United States has not heretofore acquired fee title to the improved property, the Secretary shall pay to the owner the value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the value on such date of the right retained by the owner. In situations where the United States has heretofore acquired fee title to the improved property, the occupier may notify the Secretary that such occupier elects to retain continued use and occupancy of such property pursuant to this section, in which event the occupier shall pay to the Secretary the value of the additional right <!-- PDFPage:629 -->retained, which value shall be based upon the value of the property at the time of its acquisition by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any deed or other instrument used to transfer title to property, with respect to which a right of use and occupancy is retained under this section, and any instrument evidencing any right of use and occupancy retained by any occupier under this section, shall provide that such property shall not be used for any purpose which is incompatible with purposes of this subchapter, or which impairs the usefulness and attractiveness of such area, and if it should be so used, that the Secretary many&nbsp;<sup><a href="#460x-9_1_target" name="460x-9_1">1</a></sup> terminate such right. In the event the Secretary exercises his power of termination under this subsection he shall pay to the owner of the right terminated an amount equal to the value of that portion of such right which remained unexpired on the date of such termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of right to member of immediate family; owner option to terminate; payment by Secretary; &ldquo;member of the immediate family&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any owner or occupier of improved property who retains a right of use and occupancy under subsection (b) of this section may convey or lease such right during its existence to a member of such owner or occupier's immediate family for noncommercial residential purposes which are not incompatible with the purposes of this subchapter and which do not impair the usefulness and attractiveness of the area designated for inclusion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any owner or occupier of improved property who has retained a right of use and occupancy under subsection (b) of this section may terminate such right at any time, and the Secretary shall pay, within 120 days after the date of such termination, to the owner of the right terminated an amount equal to the value of that portion of such right which remained unexpired on the date of such termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) As used in this subchapter, the term &ldquo;member of the immediate family&rdquo; means spouse, brother, sister, or child, including persons bearing such relationships through adoption, and step-child.</p>
