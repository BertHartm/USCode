<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4202. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Elephant populations in Africa have declined at an alarming rate since the mid-1970's.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The large illegal trade in African elephant ivory is the major cause of this decline and threatens the continued existence of the African elephant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The African elephant is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and its continued existence will be further jeopardized if this decline is not reversed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Because African elephant ivory is indistinguishable from Asian elephant ivory, there is a need to ensure that the trade in African elephant ivory does not further endanger the Asian elephant, which is listed as endangered under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) and under Appendix I of CITES.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In response to the significant illegal trade in African elephant ivory, the parties to CITES established the CITES Ivory Control System to curtail the illegal trade and to encourage African countries to manage, conserve, and protect their African elephant populations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The CITES Ivory Control System entered into force recently and should be allowed to continue in force for a reasonable period of time to assess its effectiveness in curtailing the illegal trade in African elephant ivory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Although some African countries have effective African elephant conservation programs, many do not have sufficient resources to properly manage, conserve, and protect their elephant populations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The United States, as a party to CITES and a large market for worked ivory, shares responsibility for supporting and implementing measures to stop the illegal trade in African elephant ivory and to provide for the conservation of the African elephant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) There is no evidence that sport hunting is part of the poaching that contributes to the illegal trade in African elephant ivory, and there is evidence that the proper utilization of well-managed elephant populations provides an important source of funding for African elephant conservation programs.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a moratorium on the importation of raw and worked ivory from an ivory producing country immediately upon making a determination that the country does not meet all the criteria set forth in section 4221(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Later establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With regard to any ivory producing country for which the Secretary has insufficient information to make a determination pursuant to section 4221(b) of this title, the Secretary shall establish a moratorium on the importation of raw and worked ivory from such country not later than January 1, 1990, unless, based on new information, the Secretary concludes before that date that the country meets all of the criteria set forth in section 4221(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Intermediary countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a moratorium on the importation of raw and worked ivory from an intermediary country immediately upon making a determination that the country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not a party to CITES;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) does not adhere to the CITES Ivory Control System;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) imports raw ivory from a country that is not an ivory producing country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) imports raw or worked ivory from a country that is not a party to CITES;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) imports raw or worked ivory that originates in an ivory producing country in violation of the laws of that ivory producing country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) substantially increases its imports of raw or worked ivory from a country that is subject to a moratorium under this chapter during the first three months of that moratorium; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) imports raw or worked ivory from a country that is subject to a moratorium under this chapter after the first three months of that moratorium, unless the ivory is imported by vessel during the first six months of that moratorium and is accompanied by shipping documents which show that it was exported before the establishment of the moratorium.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suspension of moratorium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall suspend a moratorium established under this section if, after notice and public comment, the Secretary determines that the reasons for establishing the moratorium no longer exist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Individuals may import sport-hunted elephant trophies that they have legally taken in an ivory producing country that has submitted an ivory quota. The Secretary shall not establish any moratorium under this section, pursuant to a petition or otherwise, which prohibits the importation into the United States of sport-hunted trophies from elephants that are legally taken by the importer or the importer's principal in an <!-- PDFPage:2010 -->ivory producing country that has submitted an ivory quota.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Confiscated ivory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Trade in raw or worked ivory that is confiscated by an ivory producing country or an intermediary country and is disposed of pursuant to the CITES Ivory Control System shall not be the sole cause for the establishment of a moratorium under this subchapter if all proceeds from the disposal of the confiscated ivory are used solely to enhance wildlife conservation programs or conservation purposes of CITES. With respect to any country that was not a party to CITES at the time of such confiscation, this subsection shall not apply until such country develops appropriate measures to assure that persons with a history of illegal dealings in ivory shall not benefit from the disposal of confiscated ivory.</p>
