<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1632 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) this Nation historically has recognized the importance of protecting special areas of its public domain, but these efforts have been directed almost exclusively to land areas above the high-water mark;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) certain areas of the marine environment possess conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, scientific, educational, cultural, archeological, or esthetic qualities which give them special national, and in some cases international, significance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) while the need to control the effects of particular activities has led to enactment of resource-specific legislation, these laws cannot in all cases provide a coordinated and comprehensive approach to the conservation and management of special areas of the marine environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a Federal program which establishes areas of the marine environment which have special conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, cultural, archeological, scientific, educational, or esthetic qualities as national marine sanctuaries managed as the National Marine Sanctuary System will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) improve the conservation, understanding, management, and wise and sustainable use of marine resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enhance public awareness, understanding, and appreciation of the marine environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) maintain for future generations the habitat, and ecological services, of the natural assemblage of living resources that inhabit these areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes and policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes and policies of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to identify and designate as national marine sanctuaries areas of the marine environment which are of special national significance and to manage these areas as the National Marine Sanctuary System;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide authority for comprehensive and coordinated conservation and management of these marine areas, and activities affecting them, in a manner which complements existing regulatory authorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to maintain the natural biological communities in the national marine sanctuaries, and to protect, and, where appropriate, restore and enhance natural habitats, populations, and ecological processes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance public awareness, understanding, appreciation, and wise and sustainable use of the marine environment, and the natural, historical, cultural, and archeological resources of the National Marine Sanctuary System;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to support, promote, and coordinate scientific research on, and long-term monitoring of, the resources of these marine areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to facilitate to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource protection, all public and private uses of the resources of these marine areas not prohibited pursuant to other authorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to develop and implement coordinated plans for the protection and management of these areas with appropriate Federal agencies, State and local governments, Native American tribes and organizations, international organizations, and other public and private interests concerned with the continuing health and resilience of these marine areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to create models of, and incentives for, ways to conserve and manage these areas, including the application of innovative management techniques; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) to cooperate with global programs encouraging conservation of marine resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established the National Marine Sanctuary System, which shall consist of national marine sanctuaries designated by the Secretary in accordance with this chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Purpose</em>. This Executive Order will help protect the significant natural and cultural resources within the marine environment for the benefit of present and future generations by strengthening and expanding the Nation's system of marine protected areas (MPAs). An expanded and strengthened comprehensive system of marine protected areas throughout the marine environment would enhance the conservation of our Nation's natural and cultural marine heritage and the ecologically and economically sustainable use of the marine environment for future generations. To this end, the purpose of this order is to, consistent with domestic and international law: (a) strengthen the management, protection, and conservation of existing marine protected areas and establish new or expanded MPAs; (b) develop a scientifically based, comprehensive national system of MPAs representing diverse U.S. marine ecosystems, and the Nation's natural and cultural resources; and (c) avoid causing harm to MPAs through federally conducted, approved, or funded activities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. For the purposes of this order: (a) &ldquo;Marine protected area&rdquo; means any area of the marine <!-- PDFPage:1634 -->environment that has been reserved by Federal, State, territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Marine environment&rdquo; means those areas of coastal and ocean waters, the Great Lakes and their connecting waters, and submerged lands thereunder, over which the United States exercises jurisdiction, consistent with international law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The term &ldquo;United States&rdquo; includes the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>MPA Establishment, Protection, and Management</em>. Each Federal agency whose authorities provide for the establishment or management of MPAs shall take appropriate actions to enhance or expand protection of existing MPAs and establish or recommend, as appropriate, new MPAs. Agencies implementing this section shall consult with the agencies identified in subsection 4(a) of this order, consistent with existing requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>National System of MPAs</em>. (a) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior, in consultation with the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, and other pertinent Federal agencies shall develop a national system of MPAs. They shall coordinate and share information, tools, and strategies, and provide guidance to enable and encourage the use of the following in the exercise of each agency's respective authorities to further enhance and expand protection of existing MPAs and to establish or recommend new MPAs, as appropriate:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) science-based identification and prioritization of natural and cultural resources for additional protection;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) integrated assessments of ecological linkages among MPAs, including ecological reserves in which consumptive uses of resources are prohibited, to provide synergistic benefits;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) a biological assessment of the minimum area where consumptive uses would be prohibited that is necessary to preserve representative habitats in different geographic areas of the marine environment;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) an assessment of threats and gaps in levels of protection currently afforded to natural and cultural resources, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) practical, science-based criteria and protocols for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of MPAs;</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) identification of emerging threats and user conflicts affecting MPAs and appropriate, practical, and equitable management solutions, including effective enforcement strategies, to eliminate or reduce such threats and conflicts;</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) assessment of the economic effects of the preferred management solutions; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(8) identification of opportunities to improve linkages with, and technical assistance to, international marine protected area programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In carrying out the requirements of section 4 of this order, the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior shall consult with those States that contain portions of the marine environment, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, tribes, Regional Fishery Management Councils, and other entities, as appropriate, to promote coordination of Federal, State, territorial, and tribal actions to establish and manage MPAs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In carrying out the requirements of this section, the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior shall seek the expert advice and recommendations of non-Federal scientists, resource managers, and other interested persons and organizations through a Marine Protected Area Federal Advisory Committee. The Committee shall be established by the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall establish and jointly manage a website for information on MPAs and Federal agency reports required by this order. They shall also publish and maintain a list of MPAs that meet the definition of MPA for the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall establish a Marine Protected Area Center to carry out, in cooperation with the Department of the Interior, the requirements of subsection 4(a) of this order, coordinate the website established pursuant to subsection 4(d) of this order, and partner with governmental and nongovernmental entities to conduct necessary research, analysis, and exploration. The goal of the MPA Center shall be, in cooperation with the Department of the Interior, to develop a framework for a national system of MPAs, and to provide Federal, State, territorial, tribal, and local governments with the information, technologies, and strategies to support the system. This national system framework and the work of the MPA Center is intended to support, not interfere with, agencies&rsquo; independent exercise of their own existing authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) To better protect beaches, coasts, and the marine environment from pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), relying upon existing Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.] authorities, shall expeditiously propose new science-based regulations, as necessary, to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment. Such regulations may include the identification of areas that warrant additional pollution protections and the enhancement of marine water quality standards. The EPA shall consult with the Federal agencies identified in subsection 4(a) of this order, States, territories, tribes, and the public in the development of such new regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Agency Responsibilities</em>. Each Federal agency whose actions affect the natural or cultural resources that are protected by an MPA shall identify such actions. To the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable, each Federal agency, in taking such actions, shall avoid harm to the natural and cultural resources that are protected by an MPA. In implementing this section, each Federal agency shall refer to the MPAs identified under subsection 4(d) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Accountability</em>. Each Federal agency that is required to take actions under this order shall prepare and make public annually a concise description of actions taken by it in the previous year to implement the order, including a description of written comments by any person or organization stating that the agency has not complied with this order and a response to such comments by the agency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>International Law</em>. Federal agencies taking actions pursuant to this Executive Order must act in accordance with international law and with Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988, on the Territorial Sea of the United States of America [43 U.S.C. 1331 note], Presidential Proclamation 5030 of March 10, 1983, on the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States of America [16 U.S.C. 1453 note], and Presidential Proclamation 7219 of September 2, 1999, on the Contiguous Zone of the United States [43 U.S.C. 1331 note].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>General</em>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed as altering existing authorities regarding the establishment of Federal MPAs in areas of the marine environment subject to the jurisdiction and control of States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order does not diminish, affect, or abrogate Indian treaty rights or United States trust responsibilities to Indian tribes.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1635 --><p class="note-body">(c) This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable in law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the area is of special national significance due to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) its conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, scientific, cultural, archaeological, educational, or esthetic qualities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the communities of living marine resources it harbors; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) its resource or human-use values;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) existing State and Federal authorities are inadequate or should be supplemented to ensure coordinated and comprehensive conservation and management of the area, including resource protection, scientific research, and public education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) designation of the area as a national marine sanctuary will facilitate the objectives stated in paragraph (3); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the area is of a size and nature that will permit comprehensive and coordinated conservation and management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors and consultations required in making determinations and findings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining if an area of the marine environment meets the standards set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the area's natural resource and ecological qualities, including its contribution to biological productivity, maintenance of ecosystem structure, maintenance of ecologically or commercially important or threatened species or species assemblages, maintenance of critical habitat of endangered species, and the biogeographic representation of the site;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the area's historical, cultural, archaeological, or paleontological significance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the present and potential uses of the area that depend on maintenance of the area's resources, including commercial and recreational fishing, subsistence uses, other commercial and recreational activities, and research and education;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the public benefits to be derived from sanctuary status, with emphasis on the benefits of long-term protection of nationally significant resources, vital habitats, and resources which generate tourism;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the negative impacts produced by management restrictions on income-generating activities such as living and nonliving resources development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the socioeconomic effects of sanctuary designation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) the area's scientific value and value for monitoring the resources and natural processes that occur there;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1637 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) the feasibility, where appropriate, of employing innovative management approaches to protect sanctuary resources or to manage compatible uses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) the value of the area as an addition to the System.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consultation</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Fishing regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council with the opportunity to prepare draft regulations for fishing within the Exclusive Economic Zone as the Council may deem necessary to implement the proposed designation. Draft regulations prepared by the Council, or a Council determination that regulations are not necessary pursuant to this paragraph, shall be accepted and issued as proposed regulations by the Secretary unless the Secretary finds that the Council's action fails to fulfill the purposes and policies of this chapter and the goals and objectives of the proposed designation. In preparing the draft regulations, a Regional Fishery Management Council shall use as guidance the national standards of section 301(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1851) to the extent that the standards are consistent and compatible with the goals and objectives of the proposed designation. The Secretary shall prepare the fishing regulations, if the Council declines to make a determination with respect to the need for regulations, makes a determination which is rejected by the Secretary, or fails to prepare the draft regulations in a timely manner. Any amendments to the fishing regulations shall be drafted, approved, and issued in the same manner as the original regulations. The Secretary shall also cooperate with other appropriate fishery management authorities with rights or responsibilities within a proposed sanctuary at the earliest practicable stage in drafting any sanctuary fishing regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Committee action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After receiving the documents under subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate may each hold hearings on the proposed designation and on the matters set forth in the documents. If within the forty-five day period of continuous session of Congress beginning on the date of submission of the documents, either Committee issues a report concerning matters addressed in the documents, the Secretary shall consider this report before publishing a notice to designate the national marine sanctuary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taking effect of designations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In designating a national marine sanctuary, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the designation together with final regulations to implement the designation and any other matters required by law, and submit such notice to the Congress. The Secretary shall advise the public of the availability of the final management plan and the final environmental impact statement with respect to such sanctuary. The Secretary shall issue a notice of designation with respect to a proposed national marine sanctuary site not later than 30 months after the date a notice declaring the site to be an active candidate for sanctuary designation is published in the Federal Register under regulations issued under this Act, or shall publish not later than such date in the Federal Register findings regarding why such notice has not been published. No notice of designation may occur until the expiration of the period for Committee action under subsection (a)(6) of this section. The designation (and any of its terms not disapproved under this subsection) and regulations shall take effect and become final after the close of a review period of forty-five days of continuous session of Congress beginning on the day on which such notice is published unless, in the case of a national marine sanctuary that is located partially or entirely within the seaward boundary of any State, the Governor affected certifies to the Secretary that the designation or any of its terms is unacceptable, in which case the designation or the unacceptable term shall not take effect in the area of the sanctuary lying within the seaward boundary of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withdrawal of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary considers that actions taken under paragraph (1) will affect the designation of a national marine sanctuary in a manner that the goals and objectives of the sanctuary or System cannot be fulfilled, the Secretary may withdraw the entire designation. If the Secretary does not withdraw the designation, only those terms of the designation not certified under paragraph (1) shall take effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In computing the forty-five-day periods of continuous session of Congress pursuant to <!-- PDFPage:1640 -->subsection (a)(6) of this section and paragraph (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to any regulations the Secretary may establish each Federal agency proposing an action described in subparagraph (A) shall provide the Secretary with a written statement describing the action and its potential effects on sanctuary resources at the earliest practicable time, but in no case later than 45 days before the final approval of the action unless such Federal agency and the Secretary agree to a different schedule.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Secretary's recommended alternatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that a Federal agency action is likely to destroy, cause the loss of, or injure a sanctuary resource, the Secretary shall (within 45 days of receipt of complete information on the proposed agency action) recommend reasonable and prudent alternatives, which may include conduct of the action elsewhere, which can be taken by the Federal agency in implementing the agency action that will protect sanctuary resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Response to recommendations</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to follow alternative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the head of a Federal agency takes an action other than an alternative recommended by the Secretary and such action results in the destruction of, loss of, or injury to a sanctuary resource, the head of the agency shall promptly prevent and mitigate further damage and restore or replace the sanctuary resource in a manner approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review of management plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not more than five years after the date of designation of any national marine sanctuary, and thereafter at intervals not exceeding five years, the Secretary shall evaluate the substantive progress toward implementing the management plan and goals for the sanctuary, especially the effectiveness of site-specific management techniques and strategies, and shall revise the management plan and regulations as necessary to fulfill the purposes and policies of this chapter.

The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction in such a case to order such relief as the public interest and the equities of the case may require.</p>
