<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1431. Findings, purposes, and policies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) this Nation historically has recognized the importance of protecting special areas of its public domain, but these efforts have been directed almost exclusively to land areas above the high-water mark;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) certain areas of the marine environment possess conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, research, educational, or esthetic qualities which give them special national, and in some cases international, significance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) while the need to control the effects of particular activities has led to enactment of resource-specific legislation, these laws cannot in all cases provide a coordinated and comprehensive approach to the conservation and management of special areas of the marine environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a Federal program which identifies special areas of the marine environment will contribute positively to marine resources conservation, research, and management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such a Federal program will also serve to enhance public awareness, understanding, appreciation, and wise use of the marine environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) protection of these special areas can contribute to maintaining a natural assemblage of living resources for future generations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes and policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes and policies of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to identify and designate as national marine sanctuaries areas of the marine environment which are of special national significance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide authority for comprehensive and coordinated conservation and management of these marine areas, and activities affecting them, in a manner which complements existing regulatory authorities.<sup><a href="#1431_1_target" name="1431_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to support, promote, and coordinate scientific research on, and monitoring of, the resources of these marine areas, especially long-term monitoring and research of these areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance public awareness, understanding, appreciation, and wise use of the marine environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to facilitate to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource protection, all public and private uses of the re<!-- PDFPage:1433 -->sources of these marine areas not prohibited pursuant to other authorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to develop and implement coordinated plans for the protection and management of these areas with appropriate Federal agencies, State and local governments, Native American tribes and organizations, international organizations, and other public and private interests concerned with the continuing health and resilience of these marine areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to create models of, and incentives for, ways to conserve and manage these areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to cooperate with global programs encouraging conservation of marine resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) to maintain, restore, and enhance living resources by providing places for species that depend upon these marine areas to survive and propagate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may designate any discrete area of the marine environment as a national marine sanctuary and promulgate regulations implementing the designation if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) determines that the designation will fulfill the purposes and policies of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the area is of special national significance due to its resource or human-use values;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) existing State and Federal authorities are inadequate or should be supplemented to <!-- PDFPage:1435 -->ensure coordinated and comprehensive conservation and management of the area, including resource protection, scientific research, and public education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) designation of the area as a national marine sanctuary will facilitate the objectives in subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the area is of a size and nature that will permit comprehensive and coordinated conservation and management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors and consultations required in making determinations and findings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining if an area of the marine environment meets the standards set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the area's natural resource and ecological qualities, including its contribution to biological productivity, maintenance of ecosystem structure, maintenance of ecologically or commercially important or threatened species or species assemblages, maintenance of critical habitat of endangered species, and the biogeographic representation of the site;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the area's historical, cultural, archaeological, or paleontological significance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the present and potential uses of the area that depend on maintenance of the area's resources, including commercial and recreational fishing, subsistence uses, other commercial and recreational activities, and research and education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the present and potential activities that may adversely affect the factors identified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the existing State and Federal regulatory and management authorities applicable to the area and the adequacy of those authorities to fulfill the purposes and policies of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the manageability of the area, including such factors as its size, its ability to be identified as a discrete ecological unit with definable boundaries, its accessibility, and its suitability for monitoring and enforcement activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the public benefits to be derived from sanctuary status, with emphasis on the benefits of long-term protection of nationally significant resources, vital habitats, and resources which generate tourism;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the negative impacts produced by management restrictions on income-generating activities such as living and nonliving resources development; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the socioeconomic effects of sanctuary designation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making determinations and findings, the Secretary shall consult with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretaries of State, Defense, Transportation, and the Interior, the Administrator, and the heads of other interested Federal agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the responsible officials or relevant agency heads of the appropriate State and local government entities, including coastal zone management agencies, that will or are likely to be affected by the establishment of the area as a national marine sanctuary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the appropriate officials of any Regional Fishery Management Council established by section 302 of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1852) that may be affected by the proposed designation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) other interested persons.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Resource assessment report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making determinations and findings, the Secretary shall draft, as part of the environmental impact statement referred to in section 1434(a)(2) of this title, a resource assessment report documenting present and potential uses of the area, including commercial and recreational fishing, research and education, minerals and energy development, subsistence uses, and other commercial, governmental, or recreational uses. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall draft a resource assessment section for the report regarding any commercial, governmental, or recreational resource uses in the area under consideration that are subject to the primary jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator, shall draft a resource assessment section for the report, including information on any past, present, or proposed future disposal or discharge of materials in the vicinity of the proposed sanctuary. Public disclosure by the Secretary of such information shall be consistent with national security regulations.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sanctuary proposal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In proposing to designate a national marine sanctuary, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue, in the Federal Register, a notice of the proposal, proposed regulations that may be necessary and reasonable to implement the proposal, and a summary of the draft management plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide notice of the proposal in newspapers of general circulation or electronic media in the communities that may be affected by the proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on the same day the notice required by subparagraph (A) is issued, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate documents, including an executive summary, consisting of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the terms of the proposed designation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the basis of the findings made under section 1433(a) of this title with respect to the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an assessment of the considerations under section 1433(b)(1) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) proposed mechanisms to coordinate existing regulatory and management authorities within the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the draft management plan detailing the proposed goals and objectives, management responsibilities, resource studies, interpretive and educational programs, and enforcement, including surveillance activities for the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) an estimate of the annual cost of the proposed designation, including costs of personnel, equipment and facilities, enforcement, research, and public education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) the draft environmental impact statement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) an evaluation of the advantages of cooperative State and Federal management if all or part of a proposed marine sanctuary is within the territorial limits of any State or is superjacent to the subsoil and seabed within the seaward boundary of a State, as that boundary is established under the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) the proposed regulations referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Environmental impact statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prepare a draft environmental impact statement, as provided by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), on the proposal that includes the resource assessment report required under section 1433(b)(3) of this title, maps depicting the boundaries of the proposed designated area, and the existing and potential uses and resources of the area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) make copies of the draft environmental impact statement available to the public.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Public hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No sooner than thirty days after issuing a notice under this subsection, the Secretary shall hold at least one public hearing in the coastal area or areas that will be most affected by the proposed designation of the area as a national marine sanctuary for the purpose of receiving the views of interested parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Terms of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms of designation of a sanctuary shall include the geographic area proposed to be included within the sanctuary, the characteristics of the area that give it conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, research, <!-- PDFPage:1437 -->educational, or esthetic value, and the types of activities that will be subject to regulation by the Secretary to protect those characteristics. The terms of designation may be modified only by the same procedures by which the original designation is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Fishing regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council with the opportunity to prepare draft regulations for fishing within the Exclusive Economic Zone as the Council may deem necessary to implement the proposed designation. Draft regulations prepared by the Council, or a Council determination that regulations are not necessary pursuant to this paragraph, shall be accepted and issued as proposed regulations by the Secretary unless the Secretary finds that the Council's action fails to fulfill the purposes and policies of this chapter and the goals and objectives of the proposed designation. In preparing the draft regulations, a Regional Fishery Management Council shall use as guidance the national standards of section 301(a) of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1851) to the extent that the standards are consistent and compatible with the goals and objectives of the proposed designation. The Secretary shall prepare the fishing regulations, if the Council declines to make a determination with respect to the need for regulations, makes a determination which is rejected by the Secretary, or fails to prepare the draft regulations in a timely manner. Any amendments to the fishing regulations shall be drafted, approved, and issued in the same manner as the original regulations. The Secretary shall also cooperate with other appropriate fishery management authorities with rights or responsibilities within a proposed sanctuary at the earliest practicable stage in drafting any sanctuary fishing regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Committee action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After receiving the documents under subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate may each hold hearings on the proposed designation and on the matters set forth in the documents. If within the forty-five day period of continuous session of Congress beginning on the date of submission of the documents, either Committee issues a report concerning matters addressed in the documents, the Secretary shall consider this report before publishing a notice to designate the national marine sanctuary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taking effect of designations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In designating a national marine sanctuary, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the designation together with final regulations to implement the designation and any other matters required by law, and submit such notice to the Congress.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) This subsection is enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of each House of Congress, respectively, and as such is deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in the case of resolutions described in this subsection. This subsection supersedes other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith, and is enacted with full recognition of the con<!-- PDFPage:1438 -->stitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as those relate to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of such House.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Secretary's recommended alternatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that a Federal agency action is likely to destroy, cause the loss of, or injure a sanctuary resource, the Secretary shall (within 45 days of receipt of complete information on the proposed agency action) recommend reasonable and prudent alternatives, which may include conduct of the action elsewhere, which can be taken by the Federal agency in implementing the agency action that will protect sanctuary resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Response to recommendations</h4>
