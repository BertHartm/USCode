<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) most of the productive forest land of the United States is in private, State, and local governmental ownership, and the capacity of the United States to produce renewable forest resources is significantly dependent on such non-Federal forest lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adequate supplies of timber and other forest resources are essential to the United States, and adequate supplies are dependent on efficient methods for establishing, managing, and harvesting trees and processing, marketing, and using wood and wood products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) nearly one-half of the wood supply of the United States comes from nonindustrial private timberlands and such percentage could rise with expanded assistance programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) managed forest lands provide habitats for fish and wildlife, as well as aesthetics, outdoor recreation opportunities, and other forest resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the soil, water, and air quality of the United States can be maintained and improved through good stewardship of privately held forest resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) insects and diseases affecting trees occur and sometimes create emergency conditions on all land, whether Federal or non-Federal, and efforts to prevent and control such insects and diseases often require coordinated action by both Federal and non-Federal land managers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) fires in rural areas threaten human lives, property, forests and other resources, and Federal-State cooperation in forest fire protection has proven effective and valuable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) trees and forests are of great environmental and economic value to urban areas;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment and purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a program, to be known as the Forest Legacy Program, in cooperation with appropriate State, regional, and other units of government for the purposes of ascertaining and protecting environmentally important forest areas that are threatened by conversion to nonforest uses and, through the use of conservation easements and other mechanisms, for promoting forest land protection and other conservation opportunities. Such purposes shall also include the protection of important scenic, cultural, fish, wildlife, and recreational resources, riparian areas, and other ecological values.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State and regional forest legacy programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exercise the authority under subsection (a) of this section in conjunction with State or regional programs that the Secretary deems consistent with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interests in land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authorities granted under section 515 of this title and section 428a(a) of title 7, the Secretary may acquire from willing landowners lands and interests therein, including conservation easements and rights of public access, for Forest Legacy Program purposes. The Secretary shall not acquire conservation easements with title held in common ownership with any other entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Implementation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Lands and interests therein acquired under subsection (c) of this section may be held in perpetuity for program and easement administration purposes as the Secretary may provide. In administering lands and interests therein under the program, the Secretary shall identify the environmental values to be protected by entry of the lands into the program, management activities which are planned and the manner in which they may af<!-- PDFPage:1877 -->fect the values identified, and obtain from the landowner other information determined appropriate for administration and management purposes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Initial programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than November 28, 1991, the Secretary shall establish a regional program in furtherance of the Northern Forest Lands Study in the States of New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine under Public Law 100&ndash;446. The Secretary shall establish additional programs in each of the Northeast, Midwest, South, and Western regions of the United States, and the Pacific Northwest (including the State of Washington), on the preparation of an assessment of the need for such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than November 28, 1991, and in consultation with State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committees established under section 2113(b) of this title and similar regional organizations, the Secretary shall establish eligibility criteria for the designation of forest areas from which lands may be entered into the Forest Legacy Program and subsequently select such appropriate areas. To be eligible, such areas shall have significant environmental values or shall be threatened by present or future conversion to nonforest uses. Of land proposed to be included in the Forest Legacy Program, the Secretary shall give priority to lands which can be effectively protected and managed, and which have important scenic or recreational values; riparian areas; fish and wildlife values, including threatened and endangered species; or other ecological values.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For areas included in the Forest Legacy Program, an owner of lands or interests in lands who wishes to participate may prepare and submit an application at such time in such form and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe. The Secretary shall give reasonable advance notice for the submission of all applications to the State forester, equivalent State official, or other appropriate State or regional natural resource management agency. If applications exceed the ability of the Secretary to fund them, priority shall be given to those forest areas having the greatest need for protection pursuant to the criteria described in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) State consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a State has not approved the acquisition of land under section 515 of this title, the Secretary shall not acquire lands or interests therein under authority granted by this section outside an area of that State designated as a part of a program established under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Forest management activities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Conservation easements or deed reservations acquired or reserved pursuant to this section may allow forest management activities, including timber management, on areas entered in the Forest Legacy Program insofar as the Secretary deems such activities consistent with the purposes of this section.</p>

Such costs may include, but are not limited to, those associated with planning, administration, property acquisition, and property management. To the extent practicable, the Federal share of total program costs shall not exceed 75 percent, including any in-kind contribution.</p>
