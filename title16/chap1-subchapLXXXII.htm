<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that certain outstanding natural features, including forests, beaches, dune formations, and ancient glacial phenomena, exist along the mainland shore of Lake Michigan and on certain nearby islands in Benzie and Leelanau Counties, Michigan, and that such features ought to be preserved in their natural setting and protected from developments and uses which would destroy the scenic beauty and natural character of the area. In order to accomplish this purpose for the benefit, inspiration, education, recreation, and enjoyment of the public, the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) is authorized to take appropriate action, as herein provided, to establish in the State of Michigan the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. In carrying out the provisions of this subchapter, the Secretary shall administer and protect the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in a manner which provides for recreational opportunities consistent with the maximum protection of the natural environment within the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cooperation between Federal, State, and local governments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In preserving the lakeshore and stabilizing its development, substantial reliance shall be placed on cooperation between Federal, State, and local governments to apply sound principles of land use planning and zoning. In developing the lakeshore, full recognition shall be given to protecting the private properties for the enjoyment of the owners.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this subchapter, the term &ldquo;improved property&rdquo; means a detached, one-family dwelling, construction of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) was begun before December 31, 1964, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for the purposes of section 460x&ndash;9(b) or (d) of this title, was begun on or after December 31, 1964, and before October 21, 1970, and has been openly and continuously used, at least during the summer months of each year when similar dwellings in the area are used, as a residential dwelling since such construction was completed, and with respect to the portion of such period after any acquisition of such property by the United States, by the owner, or a member of the immediate family of the owner, of such dwelling on the date of such acquisition,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated, such land being in the same ownership as the dwelling, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures accessory to the dwelling which are situated on the lands so designated. The amount of land so designated shall in every case be at least three acres in area, or all of such lesser acreage as may be held in the same ownership as the dwelling, and in making such designation the Secretary shall take into account the manner of noncommercial residential use in which the dwelling and land have customarily been enjoyed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization to exclude beach lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may exclude from the land designated under subsection (a) of this section any beach or waters on Lake Michigan, together with so much of the land adjoining any such beach or waters as the Secretary may deem necessary for public access thereto. If the Secretary makes such exclusion, an appropriate buffer zone shall be provided between any residence and the public access or beach.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization to exclude recently improved property; termination, compensation, and notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may exclude from the category of &ldquo;improved property&rdquo; under this subchapter any property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section which the Secretary determines is in an area required for public use or development in the immediate future. In making <!-- PDFPage:565 -->any such determination the Secretary shall take into account the proximity of such property to any other improved property, the development or public use of the lakeshore and the related timetable therefor, and the anticipated availability in the immediate future of funds related to such development or public use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to any improved property, as defined in subsection (a)(2) of this section, with respect to which the occupier has retained a right of use and occupancy under section 460x&ndash;9(b) of this title, the Secretary may terminate such right 90 days after notifying in writing the occupier, if the Secretary determines that such improved property is needed for public use or development under this subchapter.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall pay to the owner of the right terminated an amount equal to the value of that portion of such right which remained unexpired on the date of such termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary must, within 60 days after October 22, 1982, notify in writing any owner or occupier of property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section that an option to retain rights with respect to such property exists under section 460x&ndash;9(b) of this title, whether such property shall be subject to any action by the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the nature of such proposed action, the reasons for such proposed action, and the contemplated timetable therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) With respect to any proposed action to be taken under paragraph (2) of this subsection, if the Secretary determines within 60 days after October 22, 1982, after taking into account timetable and funding projections, that, consistent with the General Management Plan dated October 1979, public use or development is anticipated before 1998 for an area containing any improved property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall include notice of such determination in any notification under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

If the Secretary is unable to effect such an exchange, such lands may be offered for sale to the person who owned such lands immediately before their acquisition by the Secretary. If such previous owner declines such offer, the Secretary may sell such lands to any buyer. Proceeds from any sale under this subsection shall be credited to the account established under section 17 of this Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administration of certain lands as Resource Preservation Areas</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as an exercise of a right of first refusal under paragraph (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may negotiate with willing sellers for the transfer of fee title to other lesser interests to lands described in subsection (c) of this section.
