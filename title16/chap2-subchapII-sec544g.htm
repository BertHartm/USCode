<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Acquisition authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to acquire any lands or interests therein within the special <!-- PDFPage:945 -->management areas and the Dodson/Warrendale Special Purchase Unit which the Secretary determines are needed to achieve the purposes of sections 544 to 544p of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That any lands, waters, or interests therein owned by either State or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation or exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Lands within the State of Oregon acquired by the Secretary pursuant to sections 544 to 544p of this title shall become part of the Mount Hood National Forest. Lands within the State of Washington acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this section shall become part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. All lands acquired by the Secretary pursuant to sections 544 to 544p of this title shall be subject to the laws and regulations pertaining to the National Forest System and sections 544 to 544p of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on eminent domain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where authorized in subsection (a) of this section to acquire land or interests therein without the consent of the owner, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquire only such land or interests therein as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of sections 544 to 544p of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) do so only in cases where all reasonable efforts to acquire with the consent of the owner such lands, or interests therein, have failed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may not acquire without the consent of the owner lands or interests therein which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on November 17, 1986, were used primarily for educational, religious, or charitable purposes, single-family residential purposes, farming, or grazing so long as the existing character of that use is not substantially changed or permitted for change;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are located in counties with land use ordinances in which the Secretary has concurred pursuant to section 544f of this title, unless such lands are being used, or are in imminent danger of being used, in a manner incompatible with such ordinances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) are within the boundaries of the Dodson/Warrendale Special Purchase Unit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) are owned by an Indian tribe, held in trust by the United States for an Indian tribe or member of an Indian tribe, or otherwise administered by the United States for the benefit of an Indian tribe or member of an Indian tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Hardship cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In exercising authority to acquire lands pursuant to this section the Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by any person or entity owning any land, or interest in land, within the boundaries of a special management area. In considering such offer, the Secretary shall take into consideration any hardship to the owner which might result from any undue delay in acquiring the property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Land exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized and directed, in conformance with the provisions of this subsection, to acquire by exchange any parcel of unimproved forest land at least forty acres in size within the boundaries of the special management areas which is owned by any private forest land owner if, after November 17, 1986, but within one hundred and eighty days after final adoption of the management plan, such private forest land owner offers to the United States such parcel of forest land.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In exercising this authority to acquire forest lands pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary may accept title to such lands and convey to the owner federally owned lands deemed appropriate by the Secretary within the States of Oregon and Washington, regardless of the State in which the transferred lands are located. Forest lands exchanged pursuant to this subsection shall be of approximately equal value: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may accept cash from or pay cash to the grantor in such an exchange in order to equalize minor differences in the values of the properties exchanged: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary may reserve in any conveyance pursuant to this subsection such easements, subsurface rights, and any other interests in land deemed necessary or desirable: <em>Provided further</em>, That the valuation of lands exchanged shall be determined in terms of forest uses for timber.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the intention of Congress that land exchanges pursuant to this subsection shall be completed no later than five years after November 17, 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the event that exchanges authorized by this section leave any private forest land owner with ownership of an uneconomic remnant of forest land contiguous to a special management area, the Secretary is authorized to acquire such forest lands as if they were within the boundaries of a special management area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The following-described Federal lands and interests therein are hereby identified as candidate lands for exchanges conducted pursuant to this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the determination of which candidate lands will be exchanged, and in what sequence, shall be at the discretion of the Secretary. Subject to valid existing rights, such lands are hereby withdrawn from all forms of entry or appropriation or disposal under the public land laws, and from location, entry, and patent under the United States mining law, and from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing and all amendments thereto until the Secretary determines such lands are no longer needed to complete exchanges authorized by this section: <em>Provided</em>, That such period shall not extend beyond five years:</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) In return for the Nursery Site properties, Skamania County is authorized and directed to negotiate with the Forest Service the conveyance of approximately 120 acres of high biodiversity, special management lands located near Table Mountain within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, title to which must be acceptable to the Secretary of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) Before this exchange can occur, it must be of equal value and the Secretary and the Skamania County Board of Commissioners must agree on the exact parcels of land to be included in the exchange. An agreement signed by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Skamania County Board of Commissioners describing the properties involved and a certification that the exchange is of equal value must be completed no later than September 30, 1999.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) During this two-year negotiating period, the Wind River Nursery property shall not be conveyed to another party. The Forest Service shall maintain the site in a tenantable condition.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) Except as provided herein, the exchange shall be for equal value in accordance with land exchange authorities applicable to the National Forest System.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) The Secretary is directed to equalize values by not only cash and exchange of lands, easements, reservations, and other interests in lands, but also by full value credit for such services as Skamania County provides to the Gifford Pinchot and Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and as the Secretary and Skamania County deem appropriate. The Secretary may accept services in lieu of cash when the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:948 -->can discern cash value for the services and when the Secretary determines such services would provide direct benefits to lands and resources and users of such lands and resources under the jurisdiction of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(g) Any cash equalization which Skamania County elects to make may be made up to 50 percent of the fair market value of the Federal property, and such cash equalization may be made in installments over a period not to exceed 25 years. Payments received as partial consideration shall be deposited into the fund in the Treasury established under the Act of December 4, 1967 [16 U.S.C. 484a], commonly known as the Sisk Act, and shall be available for expenditure as provided in the Act except that the Secretary may not use those funds to purchase lands within Skamania County.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(h) In defining the Federal estate to be conveyed, the Secretary may require such additional terms and conditions as deemed necessary in connection with assuring equal value and public interest considerations in this exchange including, but not limited to, continued research use of the Wind River Experimental Forest and protection of natural, cultural, and historic resources, existing administrative sites, and a scenic corridor for the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(i) This authorization is predicated on Skamania County's Board of Commissioners commitment to give foremost consideration to preservation of the overall integrity of the site and conservation of the educational and research potential of the site, including providing for access to and assurance of the continued administration and operation of forestry research on the adjacent Thornton Munger Research Natural Area.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(j) The Secretary is further directed to cooperate with Skamania County to address applicable Federal and State environmental laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(k) Notwithstanding the processes involved with the National Environmental Policy Act [of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] and the State Environmental Policy Act, should the Secretary of Agriculture and the Skamania County Board of Commissioners fail to reach an agreement on an equal value exchange defined under the terms of this legislation by September 30, 1999, the Wind River Nursery Site shall remain under Forest Service ownership and be maintained by the Forest Service in a tenantable condition.&rdquo;</p>
