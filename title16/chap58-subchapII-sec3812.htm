<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) set aside, diverted or otherwise not cultivated under a program administered by the Secretary for any such crops to reduce production of an agricultural commodity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, as of January 1, 1990, or 2 years after the Soil Conservation Service has completed a soil survey for the farm, whichever is later, a person is actively applying a conservation plan, such person shall have until January 1, 1995, to comply with the plan without being subject to program ineligibility. In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary, Soil Conservation Service, and local soil conservation districts shall minimize the quantity of documentation a person must submit to comply with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person who owns or operates highly erodible land that was the subject of a contract entered into under subpart B of part I of subchapter IV of this chapter shall only be required to apply a conservation plan established under this subchapter. The person shall not be required to meet a higher conservation standard than the standard applied to other highly erodible cropland located within the same area. If the person's conservation plan requires structures to be constructed, the person shall have until 2 years after the expiration of such contract to comply with the conservation plan, or a longer period of time if the Secretary determines compliance is otherwise technically or economically not feasible, or such longer period is otherwise appropriate, before such person will be subject to program ineligibility with respect to such land under section 3811 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) On the expiration of a contract entered into under subpart B of part I of subchapter IV of this chapter, the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the acreage that was the subject of such contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on highly erodible land in an area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) within a conservation district, under a conservation system that has been approved by a conservation district after the district <!-- PDFPage:2050 -->has determined that the conservation system is in conformity with technical standards set forth in the Soil Conservation Service technical guide for such district; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not within a conservation district, under a conservation system determined by the Secretary to be adequate for the protection of highly erodible land that has been set aside or for the production of such agricultural commodity on any highly erodible land subject to this chapter; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) on highly erodible land that is planted or set aside in reliance on a determination by the Soil Conservation Service that such land was not highly erodible land, except that this paragraph shall not apply to any agricultural commodity that was planted or set aside on any land after the Soil Conservation Service determines that such land is highly erodible land; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) on highly erodible land planted to alfalfa during each of the 1981 through 1985 crop years as part of a rotation practice approved by the Secretary, if the person has submitted a conservation plan, in which case, such person shall have until June 1, 1988, to comply with the plan without being subject to program ineligibility under section 3811 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Program ineligibility inapplicable to pre-December 23, 1985, section 3811 loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 3811 of this title shall not apply to a loan described in section 3811 of this title made before December 23, 1985.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitations on ineligibility for tenants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a tenant is determined to be ineligible for payments and other benefits under section 3811 of this title, the Secretary may limit such ineligibility only to the farm which is the basis for such ineligibility determination if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the tenant has established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the tenant has made a good faith effort to meet the requirements of this section, including enlisting the assistance of the Secretary to obtain a reasonable conservation plan for such farm; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Graduated sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No person shall become ineligible under section 3811 of this title for program loans, payments, and benefits as a result of the failure of such person to actively apply a conservation plan, if the Secretary determines that the person has acted in good faith and without an intent to violate this subchapter. A person who meets the requirements of this paragraph shall be allowed a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Secretary, but not to exceed 1 year, during which to implement the measures and practices necessary to be considered to be actively applying the person's conservation plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines that a person who has failed to comply with the provisions of section 3811 of this title with respect to highly erodible cropland that was not in production prior to December 23, 1985, and has acted in good faith and without an intent to violate the provisions, the Secretary shall, in lieu of applying the ineligibility provisions in section 3811 of this title, reduce by not less than $500 nor more than $5,000, depending on the seriousness of the violation as determined by the Secretary, program benefits described in section 3811 of this title that such producer would otherwise be eligible to receive in a crop year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person whose benefits are reduced in any crop year under this subsection shall continue to be eligible for all of the benefits described in section 3811 of this title for any subsequent crop year if, prior to the beginning of such subsequent crop year, the Secretary determines that such person is actively applying a conservation plan according to the schedule set forth in such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no person shall become ineligible under section 3811 of this title for program loans, payments, and benefits as a result of the failure of such person to actively apply a conservation plan, if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determines that such failure results in a violation of section 3811 of this title that is technical and minor in nature and that such violation has a minimal effect on the erosion control purposes of the conservation plan applicable to the land on which such violation has occurred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determines that such failure is due to circumstances beyond the control of the person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) grants the person a temporary variance from the practices specified in the plan for the purpose of handling a specific problem, including weather, pest, and disease problems.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Expedited procedures for temporary variances</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After consultation with local conservation districts, the Secretary shall establish expedited procedures for the consideration and granting of temporary variances under paragraph (4)(C). If the request for a temporary variance under paragraph (4)(C) involves the use of practices or measures to address weather, pest, or disease problems, the Secretary shall make a decision on whether to grant the variance during the 30-day period beginning on the date of receipt of the request. If the Secretary fails to render a decision during the period, the temporary variance shall be considered granted.</p>
