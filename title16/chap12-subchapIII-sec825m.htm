<p class="note-body">As originally enacted subsecs. (a) and (b) contained references to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Act June 25, 1936, substituted &ldquo;the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia&rdquo;, and act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May 24, 1949, substituted &ldquo;United States District Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; for &ldquo;district court of the United <!-- PDFPage:1156 -->States for the District of Columbia&rdquo;. However, the words &ldquo;United States District Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; have been deleted entirely as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that &ldquo;There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district&rdquo;, and section 88 of Title 28 which states that &ldquo;the District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district&rdquo;.</p>
