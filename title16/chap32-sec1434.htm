<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sanctuary proposal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In proposing to designate a national marine sanctuary, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue, in the Federal Register, a notice of the proposal, proposed regulations that may be necessary and reasonable to implement the proposal, and a summary of the draft management plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide notice of the proposal in newspapers of general circulation or electronic media in the communities that may be affected by the proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on the same day the notice required by subparagraph (A) is issued, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate documents, including an executive summary, consisting of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the terms of the proposed designation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the basis of the findings made under section 1433(a) of this title with respect to the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an assessment of the considerations under section 1433(b)(1) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) proposed mechanisms to coordinate existing regulatory and management authorities within the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the draft management plan detailing the proposed goals and objectives, management responsibilities, resource studies, interpretive and educational programs, and enforcement, including surveillance activities for the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) an estimate of the annual cost of the proposed designation, including costs of personnel, equipment and facilities, enforcement, research, and public education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) the draft environmental impact statement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) an evaluation of the advantages of cooperative State and Federal management if all or part of a proposed marine sanctuary is within the territorial limits of any State or is superjacent to the subsoil and seabed within the seaward boundary of a State, as that boundary is established under the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) the proposed regulations referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Environmental impact statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prepare a draft environmental impact statement, as provided by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), on the proposal that includes the resource assessment report required under section 1433(b)(3) of this title, maps depicting the boundaries of the proposed designated area, and the existing and potential uses and resources of the area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) make copies of the draft environmental impact statement available to the public.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Public hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No sooner than thirty days after issuing a notice under this subsection, the Secretary shall hold at least one public hearing in the coastal area or areas that will be most affected by the proposed designation of the area as a national marine sanctuary for the purpose of receiving the views of interested parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Terms of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms of designation of a sanctuary shall include the geographic area proposed to be included within the sanctuary, the characteristics of the area that give it conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, research, <!-- PDFPage:1437 -->educational, or esthetic value, and the types of activities that will be subject to regulation by the Secretary to protect those characteristics. The terms of designation may be modified only by the same procedures by which the original designation is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Fishing regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council with the opportunity to prepare draft regulations for fishing within the Exclusive Economic Zone as the Council may deem necessary to implement the proposed designation. Draft regulations prepared by the Council, or a Council determination that regulations are not necessary pursuant to this paragraph, shall be accepted and issued as proposed regulations by the Secretary unless the Secretary finds that the Council's action fails to fulfill the purposes and policies of this chapter and the goals and objectives of the proposed designation. In preparing the draft regulations, a Regional Fishery Management Council shall use as guidance the national standards of section 301(a) of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1851) to the extent that the standards are consistent and compatible with the goals and objectives of the proposed designation. The Secretary shall prepare the fishing regulations, if the Council declines to make a determination with respect to the need for regulations, makes a determination which is rejected by the Secretary, or fails to prepare the draft regulations in a timely manner. Any amendments to the fishing regulations shall be drafted, approved, and issued in the same manner as the original regulations. The Secretary shall also cooperate with other appropriate fishery management authorities with rights or responsibilities within a proposed sanctuary at the earliest practicable stage in drafting any sanctuary fishing regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Committee action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After receiving the documents under subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate may each hold hearings on the proposed designation and on the matters set forth in the documents. If within the forty-five day period of continuous session of Congress beginning on the date of submission of the documents, either Committee issues a report concerning matters addressed in the documents, the Secretary shall consider this report before publishing a notice to designate the national marine sanctuary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taking effect of designations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In designating a national marine sanctuary, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the designation together with final regulations to implement the designation and any other matters required by law, and submit such notice to the Congress. The Secretary shall advise the public of the availability of the final management plan and the final environmental impact statement with respect to such sanctuary. The Secretary shall issue a notice of designation with respect to a proposed national marine sanctuary site not later than 30 months after the date a notice declaring the site to be an active candidate for sanctuary designation is published in the Federal Register under regulations issued under this Act, or shall publish not later than such date in the Federal Register findings regarding why such notice has not been published. No notice of designation may occur until the expiration of the period for Committee action under subsection (a)(6) of this section. The designation (and any of its terms not disapproved under this subsection) and regulations shall take effect and become final after the close of a review period of forty-five days of continuous session of Congress beginning on the day on which such notice is published unless, in the case of a national marine sanctuary that is located partially or entirely within the seaward boundary of any State, the Governor affected certifies to the Secretary that the designation or any of its terms is unacceptable, in which case the designation or the unacceptable term shall not take effect in the area of the sanctuary lying within the seaward boundary of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withdrawal of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary considers that actions taken under paragraph (1) will affect the designation of a national marine sanctuary in a manner that the goals and objectives of the sanctuary cannot be fulfilled, the Secretary may withdraw the entire designation. If the Secretary does not withdraw the designation, only those terms of the designation not certified under paragraph (1) shall take effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In computing the forty-five-day periods of continuous session of Congress pursuant to subsection (a)(6) of this section and paragraph (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) continuity of session is broken only by an adjournment of Congress sine die; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the days on which either House of Congress is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) When the committee to which a joint resolution has been referred has reported such a resolution, it shall at any time thereafter be in order to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion shall be privileged and shall not be debatable. An amendment to the motion shall not be in order, and it shall not be in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion was agreed to or disagreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) This subsection is enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of each House of Congress, respectively, and as such is deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in the case of resolutions described in this subsection. This subsection supersedes other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith, and is enacted with full recognition of the con<!-- PDFPage:1438 -->stitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as those relate to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of such House.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Access and valid rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as terminating or granting to the Secretary the right to terminate any valid lease, permit, license, or right of subsistence use or of access that is in existence on the date of designation of any national marine sanctuary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exercise of a lease, permit, license, or right is subject to regulation by the Secretary consistent with the purposes for which the sanctuary is designated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Interagency cooperation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Review of agency actions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Federal agency actions internal or external to a national marine sanctuary, including private activities authorized by licenses, leases, or permits, that are likely to destroy, cause the loss of, or injure any sanctuary resource are subject to consultation with the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Agency statements required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to any regulations the Secretary may establish each Federal agency proposing an action described in subparagraph (A) shall provide the Secretary with a written statement describing the action and its potential effects on sanctuary resources at the earliest practicable time, but in no case later than 45 days before the final approval of the action unless such Federal agency and the Secretary agree to a different schedule.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Secretary's recommended alternatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that a Federal agency action is likely to destroy, cause the loss of, or injure a sanctuary resource, the Secretary shall (within 45 days of receipt of complete information on the proposed agency action) recommend reasonable and prudent alternatives, which may include conduct of the action elsewhere, which can be taken by the Federal agency in implementing the agency action that will protect sanctuary resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Response to recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The agency head who receives the Secretary's recommended alternatives under paragraph (2) shall promptly consult with the Secretary on the alternatives. If the agency head decides not to follow the alternatives, the agency head shall provide the Secretary with a written statement explaining the reasons for that decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review of management plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not more than five years after the date of designation of any national marine sanctuary, and thereafter at intervals not exceeding five years, the Secretary shall evaluate the substantive progress toward implementing the management plan and goals for the sanctuary, especially the effectiveness of site-specific management techniques, and shall revise the management plan and regulations as necessary to fulfill the purposes and policies of this chapter.</p>
