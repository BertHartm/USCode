<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such vegetative enhancement and other measures as may be necessary to restore or enhance prey habitat;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the identification of levels, types, timing, and terms and conditions for the allowable nonmilitary uses of lands within the conservation area that will be compatible with the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of raptor populations and habitats and the other purposes for which the conservation area is established; and</p>
