<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Apportionment of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State desiring to avail itself of the benefits of this chapter shall, by its State fish and game department, submit programs or projects for fish restoration in either of the following two ways:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State shall prepare and submit to the Secretary of the Interior a comprehensive fish and wildlife resource management plan which shall insure the perpetuation of these resources for the economic, scientific, and recreational enrichment of the people. Such plan shall be for a period of not less than five years and be based on projections of desires and needs of the people for a period of not less than fifteen years. It shall include provisions for updating at intervals of not more than three years and be provided in a format as may be required by the Secretary of the Interior. If the Secretary of the Interior finds that such plans conform to standards established by him and approves such plans, he may finance up to 75 per centum of the cost of implementing segments of those plans meeting the purposes of this chapter from funds apportioned under this chapter upon his approval of an annual agreement submitted to him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A State may elect to avail itself of the benefits of this chapter by its State fish and game department submitting to the Secretary of the Interior full and detailed statements of any fish restoration and management project proposed for that State. If the Secretary of the Interior finds that such project meets with the standards set by him and approves said project, the State fish and game department shall furnish to him such surveys, plans, specifications, and estimates therefor as he may require. If the Secretary of the Interior approves the plans, specifications, and estimates for the project, he shall notify the State fish and game department and immediately set aside so much of said appropriation as represents the share of the United States payable under this chapter on account of such project, which sum so set aside shall not exceed 75 per centum of the total estimated cost thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior shall approve only such comprehensive plans or projects as may be substantial in character and design and the expenditure of funds hereby authorized shall be applied only to such approved comprehensive fishery plan or projects and if otherwise applied they shall be replaced by the State before it may participate in any further apportionment under this chapter. No payment of any money apportioned under this chapter shall be made on any comprehensive fishery plan or project until an agreement to participate therein shall have been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) develop an inventory of important fish and wildlife habitat and other natural areas of river basins in New England.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation of fishery resource restoration plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, hereinafter referred to as the Director, in consultation with the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall formulate, establish and implement programs to restore and maintain nationally significant, interjurisdictional fishery resources originating in New England river systems, including the Connecticut, Thames, Pawcatuck, Merrimack, Saco, Androscoggin, Kennebec, Sheepscot, Duck Trap, St. George, Penobscot, Union, Narraguagus, Pleasant, Machias, Dennys, St. Croix, Meduxnekeag and Aroostock and their tributaries. These programs shall be in accordance with the schedule and responsibilities established in comprehensive basin-wide restoration plans prepared by the Director in cooperation with State, local, and other entities involved and interested in the conservation and management of the affected fishery resources. Preparation and periodic revision of restoration plans, and their implementation, shall be based on a Memorandum of Agreement for each restoration program which shall be entered into by the Director and cooperating entities. The Director shall prepare and submit to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works an annual report documenting activities undertaken and accomplishments achieved in fulfillment of this section, including an assessment of the prognosis for restoration of each of the stocks and species involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fish passage study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall conduct a study to identify impediments to upstream and downstream passage of fish in rivers and streams in the New England States due to dams that are not licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other human-caused obstructions. In addition, the study shall identify actions needed to alleviate those impediments where desirable and feasible. The study shall include, but not be limited to, identifying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) all dams not licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other human-caused obstructions on New England rivers and streams where construction of upstream or downstream fish passage facilities or their removal would benefit fishery resources, including an estimate of the degree of benefits expected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the proposed nature and size and estimated cost of appropriate fish passage facilities or other actions determined to be necessary and feasible or each dam or other obstruction identified in response to paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Director shall provide notice to the public of the extent and nature of the study by publication of such information in major newspapers in the region and by other appropriate means. Within three years of November 16, 1990, the Director shall submit a report containing the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the study to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) New England rivers fish and wildlife inventory</h4>

In addition, the Director shall, in cooperation with appropriate State agencies and local governments and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, identify appropriate public or private measures for providing the necessary protection or access for each area included in the inventory. Within two years of November 16, 1990, the Director shall submit a report containing the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the inventory and assessment to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
