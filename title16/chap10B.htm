<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funds available for expenses of investigations and administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the balance of each such annual appropriation remaining after the distribution and use under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, respectively, so much, not to exceed 6 per centum of such balance, as the Secretary of the Interior may estimate to be necessary for his or her expenses in the conduct of necessary investigations, administration, and the execution of this chapter and for aiding in the formulation, adoption, or administration of any compact between two or more States for the conservation and management of migratory fishes in marine or freshwaters, shall be deducted for that purpose, and such sum is authorized to be made available until the expiration of the next succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Apportionment among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior, after the distribution, transfer, use, and deduction under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, respectively, shall apportion the remainder of each such annual appropriation among the several States in the following manner: 40 per centum in the ratio which the area of each State including coastal and Great Lakes waters (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) bears to the total area of all the States, and 60 per centum in the ratio which the number of persons holding paid licenses to fish for sport or recreation in the State in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which such apportionment is made, as certified to said Secretary by the State fish and game departments, bears to the number of such persons in all the States. Such apportionments shall be adjusted equitably so that no State shall receive less than 1 per centum nor more than 5 per centum of the total amount apportioned. Where the apportionment to any State under this section is less than $4,500 annually, the Secretary of the Interior may allocate not more than $4,500 of said appropriation to said State to carry out the purposes of this chapter when said State certifies to the Secretary of the Interior that it has set aside not less than $1,500 from its fish-and-game funds or has made, through its legislature, an appropriation in this amount of said purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Unallocated funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">So much of any sum not allocated under the provisions of this section for any fiscal year is hereby authorized to be made available for expenditure to carry out the purposes of this chapter until the close of the succeeding fiscal year, and if unexpended or unobligated at the end of such year, such sum is hereby authorized to be made available for expenditure by the Secretary of the Interior in carrying on the research program of the Fish and Wildlife Service in respect to fish of material value for sport or recreation. The term fiscal year as used in this section shall be a period of twelve consecutive months from October 1 through the succeeding September 30, except that the period for enumeration of persons holding licenses to fish shall be a State's fiscal or license year.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Apportionment of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State desiring to avail itself of the benefits of this chapter shall, by its State fish and game department, submit programs or projects for fish restoration in either of the following two ways:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State shall prepare and submit to the Secretary of the Interior a comprehensive fish and wildlife resource management plan which shall insure the perpetuation of these resources for the economic, scientific, and recreational enrichment of the people. Such plan shall be for a period of not less than five years and be based on projections of desires and needs of the people for a period of not less than fifteen years. It shall include provisions for updating at intervals of not more than three years and be provided in a format as may be required by the Secretary of the Interior. If the Secretary of the Interior finds that such plans conform to standards established by him and approves such plans, he may finance up to 75 per centum of the cost of implementing segments of those plans meeting the purposes of this chapter from funds apportioned under this chapter upon his approval of an annual agreement submitted to him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A State may elect to avail itself of the benefits of this chapter by its State fish and game department submitting to the Secretary of the Interior full and detailed statements of any fish restoration and management project proposed for that State. If the Secretary of the Interior finds that such project meets with the standards set by him and approves said project, the State fish and game department shall furnish to him such surveys, plans, specifications, and estimates therefor as he may require. If the Secretary of the Interior approves the plans, specifications, and estimates for the project, he shall notify the State fish and game department and immediately set aside so much of said appropriation as represents the share of the United States payable under this chapter on account of such project, which sum so set aside shall not exceed 75 per centum of the total estimated cost thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior shall approve only such comprehensive plans or projects as may be substantial in character and design and the expenditure of funds hereby authorized shall be applied only to such approved comprehensive fishery plan or projects and if otherwise applied they shall be replaced by the State before it may participate in any further apportionment under this chapter. No payment of any money apportioned under this chapter shall be made on any comprehensive fishery plan or project until an agreement to participate therein shall have been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Project&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the State elects to avail itself of the benefits of this chapter by preparing a comprehensive fish and wildlife plan under option (1) of subsection (a) of this section, then the term &ldquo;project&rdquo; may be defined for the purpose of this chapter as a fishery program, all other definitions notwithstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Administrative costs in the form of overhead or indirect costs for services provided by State central service activities outside of the State fish and game department charged against programs or projects supported by funds made available under this chapter shall not exceed in any one fiscal year 3 per centum of the annual apportionment to the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Agreements to finance initial costs of acquisition of lands and construction of structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior may enter into agreements to finance up to 75 per centum of the initial costs of the acquisition of lands or interests therein and the construction of structures or facilities for&nbsp;<sup><a href="#777e_1_target" name="777e_1">1</a></sup> appropriations currently available for the purposes of this chapter; and to agree to finance up to 75 per centum of the remaining costs over such a period of time as the Secretary may consider necessary.
