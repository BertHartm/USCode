<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the sums available to the Secretary for any fiscal year under this chapter and section 669b(b) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such percentage of that sum (but at least 50 per centum and not more than 70 per centum thereof) as is considered appropriate by the Secretary, which can be matched with non-Federal moneys in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, less such amount (but not more than 4 per centum of such percentage) considered necessary by the Secretary to defray the costs of administering this chapter during such fiscal year, shall be allocated by the Secretary to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects in Canada and Mexico in accordance with section 4405(b) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the remainder of such sum after paragraph (1) is applied (but at least 30 per centum and not more than 50 per centum thereof), which can be matched with non-Federal moneys in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, shall be allocated by the Secretary to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects in the United States in accordance with section 4405(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Federal contribution for projects; non-Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal moneys allocated under subsection (a) of this section for any fiscal year to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects shall be used for the payment of not to exceed 50 per centum of the total United States contribution to the costs of such projects, or may be used for payment of 100 per centum of the costs of such projects located on Federal lands and waters, including the acquisition of inholdings within such lands and waters. The non-Federal share of the United States contribution to the costs of such projects may not be derived from Federal grant programs. In the case of a project carried out in Mexico, the non-Federal share of the United States contribution to the costs of the project may include cash contributions from non-United States sources that are used to pay costs of the project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Partial payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may from time to time make payments to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects as such projects progress, but such payments, including previous payments, if any, shall not be more than the Federal pro rata share of any such project in conformity with subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may enter into agreements to make payments on an initial portion of an approved wetlands conservation project and to agree to make payments on the remaining Federal share of the costs of such project from subsequent allocations if and when they become available. The liability of the United States under such an agreement is contingent upon the continued availability of funds for the purposes of this chapter.</p>
