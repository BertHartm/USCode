<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any fishery management plan prepared, and any regulation promulgated to implement any such plan, pursuant to this subchapter shall be consistent with the following national standards for fishery conservation and management:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the United States fishing industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Conservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the extent practicable, an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Conservation and management measures shall not discriminate between residents of different States. If it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various United States fishermen, such allocation shall be (A) fair and equitable to all such fishermen; (B) reasonably calculated to promote conservation; and (C) carried out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, consider efficiency in <!-- PDFPage:1627 -->the utilization of fishery resources; except that no such measure shall have economic allocation as its sole purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Conservation and management measures shall take into account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, fishery resources, and catches.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Conservation and management measures shall, consistent with the conservation requirements of this chapter (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities in order to (A) provide for the sustained participation of such communities, and (B) to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, (A) minimize bycatch and (B) to the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such bycatch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, promote the safety of human life at sea.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish advisory guidelines (which shall not have the force and effect of law), based on the national standards, to assist in the development of fishery management plans.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;589, &sect;5, Nov. 3, 1988, 102 Stat. 2984, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The anadromous stock of striped bass in the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River Basin area of North Carolina sustained important commercial and recreational fisheries as recently as the 1960's and 1970's.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) This stock has been declining for some time and is severely depressed at present, and may soon reach a level from which recovery will be exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The reasons for this decline are thought to include fishing; other human activities and environmental factors, such as unsuitable water flow before, during, and after critical spawning periods; degradation of water quality by pollutants; the impact of eutrophication on the food chain, and the impact of changing land use activities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Current Federal and interstate efforts to conserve the Atlantic striped bass, while effective in identifying factors contributing to the decline of other important Atlantic coastal migratory stocks of striped bass and steps that will be effective in reversing that decline, have not made a major contribution to the protection and restoration of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock of striped bass.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Because the striped bass and the aquatic environment of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin presently are being significantly affected by combined but not fully understood causes, a study should be undertaken to obtain additional biological information to understand the significance of fishing, water flows, and other factors in the decline of the striped bass populations in the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin and, if feasible, develop an effective course of action for restoring these important stocks of striped bass.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Study.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in consultation with the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) immediately undertake a biological study of the striped bass fishery resources and habitats of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin area;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) develop short-term and long-term recommendations for Federal and State government agencies for restoring and conserving such resources and habitats; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) submit the results of such study and such recommendations to the Congress and to the States of North Carolina and Virginia as soon as practicable, but not later than 36 months after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 3, 1988].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents of the study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The study conducted under this subsection shall, to the extent existing <!-- PDFPage:1628 -->data are adequate, use such existing data and shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) a description of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin area, and an investigation and analysis of the effects of land and water use practices on the striped bass population and habitats of the area;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) an investigation and analysis of the abundance and age and geographic distribution of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock of striped bass, including the amount and geographical location of migration and spawning habitat;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) an investigation and analysis of factors that may affect the abundance and age and geographic distribution of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock of striped bass, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) the extent and causes of mortality at successive stages in the life cycle of striped bass, including mortality due to recreational and commercial fishing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) the combined effects of pollution and other natural and human alterations of the physical environment, including the effects of water withdrawals, discharges, and flows, on striped bass migration and spawning and on the viability and condition of eggs and larval fish;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) an investigation and analysis of the status and effectiveness of current striped bass management measures implemented by State and Federal authorities, including State fishing regulations and Federal fish stocking activities, reservoir management and water flow regulation, and an analysis of whether any additional State or Federal measures would be effective in halting the decline and initiating the recovery of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River stock of striped bass; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) a recommendation of whether conservation of the Albermarle [sic] Sound-Roanoke River stocks of striped bass could be improved by management of these stocks under the provisions of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for Striped Bass and the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act [Pub. L. 98&ndash;613, set out below].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Participation by State Agencies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Director of the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries, the Executive Director of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the Secretary of the Virginia Department of Natural Resources, and the District Engineer for the Wilmington District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers shall be invited to have their agencies participate in conducting the study and developing recommendations pursuant to subsection (b).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To facilitate participation by the agencies referred to in paragraph (1), should they decide to participate, a Memorandum of Understanding will be executed with such officials setting forth the respective responsibilities of the entities involved in conducting the study and developing those recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out the study under subsection (b), the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, other Federal agencies, the Albermarle-Pamlico [sic] Estuarine Study, Dominion Resources, Inc./Virginia Power/North Carolina Power, affected local governments in North Carolina and Virginia, appropriate commercial and recreational fishing interests, and other interests shall be consulted, to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is authorized to be appropriated the sum of $1,000,000 to carry out the requirements of this section. These appropriations will remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) <cap-smallcap>State Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing any State to manage fisheries within the jurisdiction of another State.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(g) <cap-smallcap>Restriction on Use of Other Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization contained in section 7(d) of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 757g(d)) shall not be used to carry out this section.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Atlantic striped bass are of historic commercial and recreational importance and economic benefit to the Atlantic coastal States and to the Nation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) As a consequence of increased fishing pressure, environmental pollution, the loss and alteration of habitat, and the inadequacy of fishery conservation and management practices and controls, certain stocks of Atlantic striped bass have been severely reduced in number.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Because no single government entity has full management authority throughout the range of the Atlantic striped bass, the harvesting and conserva<!-- PDFPage:1629 -->tion of these fish have been subject to diverse, inconsistent, and intermittent State regulation that has been detrimental to the long-term maintenance of stocks of the species and to the interests of fishermen and the Nation as a whole.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It is in the national interest to implement effective procedures and measures to provide for effective interjurisdictional conservation and management of this species.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in this Act to support and encourage the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective interstate action regarding the conservation and management of the Atlantic striped bass.</p>
