<h3 class="section-head">&sect;460<em>l</em>&ndash;31. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a Federal responsibility to provide opportunities for public recreation at Federal water projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Some provisions of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act [16 U.S.C. 460<em>l</em>&ndash;12 et seq.] are outdated because of increases in demand for outdoor recreation and changes in the economic climate for recreation managing entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Provisions of such Act relating to non-Federal responsibility for all costs of operation, maintenance, and replacement of recreation facilities result in an unfair burden, especially in cases where the facilities are old or underdesigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Provisions of such Act that limit the Federal share of recreation facility development at water projects completed before 1965 to $100,000 preclude a responsible Federal share in providing adequate opportunities for safe outdoor recreation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) There should be Federal authority to expand existing recreation facilities to meet public demand, in partnership with non-Federal interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Nothing in this part changes the responsibility of the Bureau to meet the purposes for which Federal Reclamation projects were initially authorized and constructed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) It is therefore in the best interest of the people of this Nation to amend the Federal Water Project Recreation Act [16 U.S.C. 460<em>l</em>&ndash;12 et seq.] to remove outdated restrictions and authorize the Secretary of the Interior to undertake specific measures for the management of Reclamation lands.</p>
