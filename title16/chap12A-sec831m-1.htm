<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In conducting a least-cost planning program under subsection (a) of this section, the Tennessee Valley Authority shall employ and implement a planning and selection process for new energy resources which evaluates the full range of existing and incremental resources (including new power supplies, energy conservation and efficiency, and renewable energy resources) in order to provide adequate and reliable service to electric customers of the Tennessee Valley Authority at the lowest system cost.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The planning and selection process referred to in paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account necessary features for system operation, including diversity, reliability, dispatchability, and other factors of risk;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved through energy conservation and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) treat demand and supply resources on a consistent and integrated basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;System cost&rdquo; defined</h4>

Such assistance may include publications, workshops, conferences, one-on-one as<!-- PDFPage:1379 -->sistance, financial assistance, equipment loans, technology assessment studies, marketing studies, and other appropriate mechanisms to transfer information on energy efficiency and renewable energy options and programs to customers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Public review and comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before the selection and addition of a major new energy resource on the Tennessee Valley Authority system, the Tennessee Valley Authority shall provide an opportunity for public review and comment and shall include a description of any such action in an annual report to the President and Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exemption from certain requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Tennessee Valley Authority shall not be subject to the least-cost planning requirements contained in section 2621(d) of this title or any similar requirement which might arise out of the Tennessee Valley Authority's electric power transactions with the Southeastern Power Administration.</p>
