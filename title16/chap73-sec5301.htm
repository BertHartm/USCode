<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The world's rhinoceros population is declining at an alarming rate, a 90 percent decline since 1970.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All 5 subspecies of tiger are currently threatened with extinction in the wild, with approximately 5,000 to 6,000 tigers remaining worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) All rhinoceros species have been listed on Appendix I of CITES since 1977.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) All tiger subspecies have been listed on Appendix I of CITES since 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The tiger and all rhinoceros species, except the southern subspecies of white rhinoceros, are listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In 1987, the parties to CITES adopted a resolution that urged all parties to establish a moratorium on the sale and trade in rhinoceros products (other than legally taken trophies), to destroy government stockpiles of rhinoceros horn, and to exert pressure on countries continuing to allow trade in rhinoceros products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) On September 7, 1993, under section 1978 of title 22 the Secretary certified that the People's Republic of China and Taiwan were engaged in trade of rhinoceros parts and tiger parts that diminished the effectiveness of an international conservation program for that endangered species.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) On September 9, 1993, the Standing Committee of CITES, in debating the continuing problem of trade in rhinoceros horn and tiger parts, adopted a resolution urging parties to CITES to implement stricter domestic measures, up to and including an immediate prohibition in trade in wildlife species.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) On November 8, 1993, under section 1978 of title 22, the President announced that the United States would impose trade sanctions against China and Taiwan unless substantial progress was made by March 1994 towards ending trade in rhinoceros and tiger products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) On April 11, 1994, under section 1978 of title 22, the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) directed that imports of wildlife specimens and products from Taiwan be prohibited, in response to Taiwan's failure to undertake sufficient actions to stop illegal rhinoceros and tiger trade; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) indicated that the certification of China would remain in effect and directed that additional monitoring of China's progress be undertaken.</p>
