<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) certain species and population stocks of marine mammals are, or may be, in danger of extinction or depletion as a result of man's activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such species and population stocks should not be permitted to diminish beyond the point at which they cease to be a significant functioning element in the ecosystem of which they are a part, and, consistent with this major objective, they should not be permitted to diminish below their optimum sustainable population. Further measures should be immediately taken to replenish any species or population stock which has already diminished <!-- PDFPage:1615 -->below that population. In particular, efforts should be made to protect essential habitats, including the rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance for each species of marine mammal from the adverse effect of man's actions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is inadequate knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics of such marine mammals and of the factors which bear upon their ability to reproduce themselves successfully;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) negotiations should be undertaken immediately to encourage the development of international arrangements for research on, and conservation of, all marine mammals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) marine mammals and marine mammal products either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) move in interstate commerce, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) affect the balance of marine ecosystems in a manner which is important to other animals and animal products which move in interstate commerce,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and that the protection and conservation of marine mammals and their habitats is therefore necessary to insure the continuing availability of those products which move in interstate commerce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) marine mammals have proven themselves to be resources of great international significance, esthetic and recreational as well as economic, and it is the sense of the Congress that they should be protected and encouraged to develop to the greatest extent feasible commensurate with sound policies of resource management and that the primary objective of their management should be to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem. Whenever consistent with this primary objective, it should be the goal to obtain an optimum sustainable population keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the habitat.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Imposition; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be a moratorium on the taking and importation of marine mammals and marine mammal products, commencing on the effective date of this chapter, during which time no permit may be issued for the taking of any marine mammal and no marine mammal or marine mammal product may be imported into the United States except in the following cases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Consistent with the provisions of section 1374 of this title, permits may be issued by the Secretary for taking, and importation for purposes of scientific research, public display, photography for educational or commercial purposes, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock, or for importation of polar bear parts (other than internal organs) taken in sport hunts in Canada. Such permits, except permits issued under section 1374(c)(5) of this title, may be issued if the taking or importation proposed to be made is first reviewed by the Marine Mammal Commission and the Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals established under subchapter III of this chapter. The Commission and Committee shall recommend any proposed taking or importation, other than importation under section 1374(c)(5) of this title, which is consistent with the purposes and policies of section 1361 of this title. If the Secretary issues such a permit for importation, the Secretary shall issue to the importer concerned a certificate to that effect in such form as the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes, and such importation may be made upon presentation of the certificate to the customs officer concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Marine mammals may be taken incidentally in the course of commercial fishing operations and permits may be issued therefor under section 1374 of this title subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary in accordance with section 1373 of this title, or in lieu of such permits, authorizations may be granted therefor under section 1387 of this title, subject to regulations prescribed under that section by the Secretary without regard to section 1373 of this title. Such authorizations may be granted under subchapter IV of this chapter with respect to purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, subject to regulations prescribed under <!-- PDFPage:1621 -->that subchapter by the Secretary without regard to section 1373 of this title. In any event it shall be the immediate goal that the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of marine mammals permitted in the course of commercial fishing operations be reduced to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate. The Secretary of the Treasury shall ban the importation of commercial fish or products from fish which have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of United States standards. For purposes of applying the preceding sentence, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall insist on reasonable proof from the government of any nation from which fish or fish products will be exported to the United States of the effects on ocean mammals of the commercial fishing technology in use for such fish or fish products exported from such nation to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of yellowfin tuna harvested with purse seine nets in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, and products therefrom, to be exported to the United States, shall require that the government of the exporting nation provide documentary evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i)(I) the tuna or products therefrom were not banned from importation under this paragraph before the effective date of section 4 of the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the tuna or products therefrom were harvested after the effective date of section 4 of the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act by vessels of a nation which participates in the International Dolphin Conservation Program, and such harvesting nation is either a member of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission or has initiated (and within 6 months thereafter completed) all steps required of applicant nations, in accordance with article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention establishing the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, to become a member of that organization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such nation is meeting the obligations of the International Dolphin Conservation Program and the obligations of membership in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, including all financial obligations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the total dolphin mortality limits, and per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limits permitted for that nation's vessels under the International Dolphin Conservation Program do not exceed the limits determined for 1997, or for any year thereafter, consistent with the objective of progressively reducing dolphin mortality to a level approaching zero through the setting of annual limits and the goal of eliminating dolphin mortality, and requirements of the International Dolphin Conservation Program;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall not accept such documentary evidence if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the government of the harvesting nation does not provide directly or authorize the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission to release complete and accurate information to the Secretary in a timely manner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to allow determination of compliance with the International Dolphin Conservation Program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for the purposes of tracking and verifying compliance with the minimum requirements established by the Secretary in regulations promulgated under section 1385(f) of this title; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after taking into consideration such information, findings of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and any other relevant information, including information that a nation is consistently failing to take enforcement actions on violations which diminish the effectiveness of the International Dolphin Conservation Program, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, finds that the harvesting nation is not in compliance with the International Dolphin Conservation Program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall require the government of any intermediary nation to certify and provide reasonable proof to the Secretary that it has not imported, within the preceding six months, any yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a direct ban on importation to the United States under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) shall, six months after importation of yellowfin tuna or tuna products has been banned under this section, certify such fact to the President, which certification shall be deemed to be a certification for the purposes of section 1978(a) of title 22 for as long as such ban is in effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F)(i) except as provided in clause (ii), in the case of fish or products containing fish harvested by a nation whose fishing vessels engage in high seas driftnet fishing, shall require that the government of the exporting nation provide documentary evidence that the fish or fish product was not harvested with a large-scale driftnet in the South Pacific Ocean after July 1, 1991, or in any other water of the high seas after January 1, 1993, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of tuna or a product containing tuna harvested by a nation whose fishing vessels engage in high seas driftnet fishing, shall require that the government of the exporting nation provide documentary evidence that the tuna or tuna product was not harvested with a large-scale driftnet anywhere on the high seas after July 1, 1991.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (F), the term &ldquo;driftnet&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 4003 of the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 (16 U.S.C. 1822 note), except that, until January 1, 1994, the term &ldquo;driftnet&rdquo; does not include the use in the northeast Atlantic Ocean of gillnets with a total length not to exceed five kilometers if the use is in accordance with regulations adopted by the European Community pursuant to the October 28, 1991, decision by <!-- PDFPage:1622 -->the Council of Fisheries Ministers of the Community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The Secretary, on the basis of the best scientific evidence available and in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission, is authorized and directed, from time to time, having due regard to the distribution, abundance, breeding habits, and times and lines of migratory movements of such marine mammals, to determine when, to what extent, if at all, and by what means, it is compatible with this chapter to waive the requirements of this section so as to allow taking, or importing of any marine mammal, or any marine mammal product, and to adopt suitable regulations, issue permits, and make determinations in accordance with sections 1372, 1373, 1374, and 1381 of this title permitting and governing such taking and importing, in accordance with such determinations: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary, in making such determinations must be assured that the taking of such marine mammal is in accord with sound principles of resource protection and conservation as provided in the purposes and policies of this chapter: <em>Provided, further, however</em>, That no marine mammal or no marine mammal product may be imported into the United States unless the Secretary certifies that the program for taking marine mammals in the country of origin is consistent with the provisions and policies of this chapter. Products of nations not so certified may not be imported into the United States for any purpose, including processing for exportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Except for scientific research purposes, photography for educational or commercial purposes, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock as provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection, or as provided for under paragraph (5) of this subsection, during the moratorium no permit may be issued for the taking of any marine mammal which has been designated by the Secretary as depleted, and no importation may be made of any such mammal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the use of measures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by the owner of fishing gear or catch, or an employee or agent of such owner, to deter a marine mammal from damaging the gear or catch;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) by the owner of other private property, or an agent, bailee, or employee of such owner, to deter a marine mammal from damaging private property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) by any person, to deter a marine mammal from endangering personal safety; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) by a government employee, to deter a marine mammal from damaging public property,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">so long as such measures do not result in the death or serious injury of a marine mammal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall, through consultation with appropriate experts, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, publish in the Federal Register a list of guidelines for use in safely deterring marine mammals. In the case of marine mammals listed as endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.], the Secretary shall recommend specific measures which may be used to nonlethally deter marine mammals. Actions to deter marine mammals consistent with such guidelines or specific measures shall not be a violation of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If the Secretary determines, using the best scientific information available, that certain forms of deterrence have a significant adverse effect on marine mammals, the Secretary may prohibit such deterrent methods, after notice and opportunity for public comment, through regulation under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The authority to deter marine mammals pursuant to subparagraph (A) applies to all marine mammals, including all stocks designated as depleted under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A)(i) Upon request therefor by citizens of the United States who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region, the Secretary shall allow, during periods of not more than five consecutive years each, the incidental, but not intentional, taking by citizens while engaging in that activity within that region of small numbers of marine mammals of a species or population stock if the Secretary, after notice (in the Federal Register and in newspapers of general circulation, and through appropriate electronic media, in the coastal areas that may be affected by such activity) and opportunity for public comment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) finds that the total of such taking during each five-year (or less) period concerned will have a negligible impact on such species or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stock for taking for subsistence uses pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or section 1379(f) of this title or, in the case of a cooperative agreement under both this chapter and the Whaling Convention Act of 1949 (16 U.S.C. 916 et seq.), pursuant to section 1382(c) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) prescribes regulations setting forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(aa) permissible methods of taking pursuant to such activity, and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on such species or stock and its habitat, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and on the availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, on the basis of the best scientific evidence available and in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission, shall prescribe such regulations with respect to the taking and importing of animals from each species of marine mammal (including regulations on the taking and importing of individuals within population stocks) as he deems necessary and appropriate to insure that such taking will not be to the disadvantage of those species and population stocks and will be consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 1361 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors considered in prescribing regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In prescribing such regulations, the Secretary shall give full consideration to all factors which may affect the extent to which such animals may be taken or imported, including but not limited to the effect of such regulations on&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Regulations prescribed to carry out this section with respect to any species or stock of marine mammals must be made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing on both the Secretary's determination to waive the moratorium pursuant to section 1371(a)(3)(A) of this title and on such regulations, except that, in addition to any other requirements, imposed by law with respect to agency rulemaking, the Secretary shall publish and make available to the public either before or concurrent with the Publication of notice in the Federal Register of his intention to prescribe regulations under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a statement of the estimated existing levels of the species and population stocks of the marine mammal concerned;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a statement describing the evidence before the Secretary upon which he proposes to base such regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any studies made by or for the Secretary or any recommendations made by or for the Secretary or the Marine Mammal Commission which relate to the establishment of such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any regulation prescribed pursuant to this section shall be periodically reviewed, and may be modified from time to time in such manner as the Secretary deems consistent with and necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within six months after the effective date of this chapter and every twelve months thereafter, the Secretary shall report to the public through publication in the Federal Register and to the Congress on the current status of all marine mammal species and population stocks subject to the provisions of this chapter.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the period during which the permit is valid, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any other terms or conditions which the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In any case in which an application for a permit cites as a reason for the proposed taking the overpopulation of a particular species or population stock, the Secretary shall first consider whether or not it would be more desirable to transplant a number of animals (but not to exceed the number requested for taking in the application) of that species or stock to a location not then inhabited by such species or stock but previously inhabited by such species or stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Importation for scientific research, public display, or enhancing survival or recovery of species or stock</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) offers a program for education or conservation purposes that is based on professionally recognized standards of the public display community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is registered or holds a license issued under 7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) maintains facilities for the public display of marine mammals that are open to the public on a regularly scheduled basis and that access to such facilities is not limited or restricted other than by charging of an admission fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A permit under this paragraph shall grant to the person to which it is issued the right, without obtaining any additional permit or authorization under this chapter, to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) sell, export, or otherwise transfer possession of the marine mammal, or offer to sell, export, or otherwise transfer possession of the marine mammal&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) for the purpose of public display, to a person that meets the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) for the purpose of scientific research, to a person that meets the requirements of paragraph (3); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) for the purpose of enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock, to a person that meets the requirements of paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A person to which a marine mammal is sold or exported or to which possession of a marine mammal is otherwise transferred under the authority of subparagraph (B) shall have the rights and responsibilities described in subparagraph (B) with respect to the marine mammal without obtaining any additional permit or authorization under this chapter. Such responsibilities shall be limited to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for the purpose of scientific research, the responsibility to meet the requirements of paragraph (3), and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1631 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) for the purpose of enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock, the responsibility to meet the requirements of paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) finds in concurrence with the Secretary of Agriculture, that a person that holds a permit under this paragraph for a marine mammal, or a person exercising rights under subparagraph (C), no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) and is not reasonably likely to meet those requirements in the near future, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) finds that a person that holds a permit under this paragraph for a marine mammal, or a person exercising rights under subparagraph (C), no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(i) or (iii) and is not reasonably likely to meet those requirements in the near future,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary may revoke the permit in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, seize the marine mammal, or cooperate with other persons authorized to hold marine mammals under this chapter for disposition of the marine mammal. The Secretary may recover from the person expenses incurred by the Secretary for that seizure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) No marine mammal held pursuant to a permit issued under subparagraph (A), or by a person exercising rights under subparagraph (C), may be sold, purchased, exported, or transported unless the Secretary is notified of such action no later than 15 days before such action, and such action is for purposes of public display, scientific research, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock. The Secretary may only require the notification to include the information required for the inventory established under paragraph (10).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary may issue a permit under this paragraph for scientific research purposes to an applicant which submits with its permit application information indicating that the taking is required to further a bona fide scientific purpose. The Secretary may issue a permit under this paragraph before the end of the public review and comment period required under subsection (d)(2) of this section if delaying issuance of the permit could result in injury to a species, stock, or individual, or in loss of unique research opportunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No permit issued for purposes of scientific research shall authorize the lethal taking of a marine mammal unless the applicant demonstrates that a nonlethal method of conducting the research is not feasible. The Secretary shall not issue a permit for research which involves the lethal taking of a marine mammal from a species or stock that is depleted, unless the Secretary determines that the results of such research will directly benefit that species or stock, or that such research fulfills a critically important research need.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not later than 120 days after April 30, 1994, the Secretary shall issue a general authorization and implementing regulations allowing bona fide scientific research that may result only in taking by Level B harassment of a marine mammal. Such authorization shall apply to persons which submit, by 60 days before commencement of such research, a letter of intent via certified mail to the Secretary containing the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The species or stocks of marine mammals which may be harassed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The geographic location of the research.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The period of time over which the research will be conducted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Methods to be used to conduct the research.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Not later than 30 days after receipt of a letter of intent to conduct scientific research under the general authorization, the Secretary shall issue a letter to the applicant confirming that the general authorization applies, or, if the proposed research is likely to result in the taking (including Level A harassment) of a marine mammal, shall notify the applicant that subparagraph (A) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A permit may be issued for enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock only with respect to a species or stock for which the Secretary, after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and after notice and opportunity for public comment, has first determined that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) taking or importation is likely to contribute significantly to maintaining or increasing distribution or numbers necessary to ensure the survival or recovery of the species or stock; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) taking or importation is consistent (I) with any conservation plan adopted by the Secretary under section 1383b(b) of this title or any recovery plan developed under section 1533(f) of this title for the species or stock, or (II) if there is no conservation or recovery plan in place, with the Secretary's evaluation of the actions required to enhance the survival or recovery of the species or stock in light of the factors that would be addressed in a conservation plan or a recovery plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A permit issued in accordance with this paragraph may allow the captive maintenance of a marine mammal from a depleted species or stock only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) determines that captive maintenance is likely to contribute to the survival or recovery of the species or stock by maintaining a viable gene pool, increasing productivity, providing biological information, or establishing animal reserves;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) determines that the expected benefit to the affected species or stock outweighs the expected benefit of alternatives which do not require removal of animals from the wild; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) requires that the marine mammal or its progeny be returned to the natural habitat of the species or stock as soon as feasible, consistent with the objectives of any applicable conservation plan or recovery plan, or of any evaluation by the Secretary under subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may allow the public display of such a marine mammal only if the Secretary de<!-- PDFPage:1632 -->termines that such display is incidental to the authorized maintenance and will not interfere with the attainment of the survival or recovery objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary may issue a permit for the importation of polar bear parts (other than internal organs) taken in sport hunts in Canada to an applicant which submits with its permit application proof that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the applicant. Such a permit shall be issued if the Secretary, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and after notice and opportunity for public comment, finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport hunting program consistent with the purposes of the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Canada has a sport hunting program based on scientifically sound quotas ensuring the maintenance of the affected population stock at a sustainable level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the export and subsequent import are consistent with the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and other international agreements and conventions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the export and subsequent import are not likely to contribute to illegal trade in bear parts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall establish and charge a reasonable fee for permits issued under this paragraph. All fees collected under this paragraph shall be available to the Secretary until expended for use in developing and implementing cooperative research and management programs for the conservation of polar bears in Alaska and Russia pursuant to section 1383(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The Secretary shall undertake a scientific review of the impact of permits issued under this paragraph on the polar bear population stocks in Canada within 2 years after April 30, 1994. The Secretary shall provide an opportunity for public comment during the course of such review, and shall include a response to such public comment in the final report on such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall not issue permits under this paragraph after September 30, 1996, if the Secretary determines, based on the scientific review, that the issuance of permits under this paragraph is having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear population stocks in Canada. The Secretary may review such determination annually thereafter, in light of the best scientific information available, and shall complete the review not later than January 31 in any year a review is undertaken. The Secretary may issue permits under this paragraph whenever the Secretary determines, on the basis of such annual review, that the issuance of permits under this paragraph is not having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear population stocks in Canada.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary of the Interior shall, expeditiously after the expiration of the applicable 30 day period under subsection (d)(2) of this section, issue a permit for the importation of polar bear parts (other than internal organs) from polar bears taken in sport hunts in Canada before February 18, 1997, to each applicant who submits, with the permit application, proof that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the applicant. The Secretary shall issue such permits without regard to the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (C)(ii) of this paragraph, subsection (d)(3) of this section, and sections 1371 and 1372 of this title. This subparagraph shall not apply to polar bear parts that were imported before June 12, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A permit may be issued for photography for educational or commercial purposes involving marine mammals in the wild only to an applicant which submits with its permit application information indicating that the taking will be limited to Level B harassment, and the manner in which the products of such activities will be made available to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Upon request by a person for a permit under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) for a marine mammal which is in the possession of any person authorized to possess it under this chapter and which is determined under guidance under section 1421a(a) of this title not to be releasable to the wild, the Secretary shall issue the permit to the person requesting the permit if that person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) meets the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of paragraph (2)(A), in the case of a request for a permit under paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) meets the requirements of paragraph (3), in the case of a request for a permit under that paragraph; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) meets the requirements of paragraph (4), in the case of a request for a permit under that paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) No additional permit or authorization shall be required to possess, sell, purchase, transport, export, or offer to sell or purchase the progeny of marine mammals taken or imported under this subsection, if such possession, sale, purchase, transport, export, or offer to sell or purchase is&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State enforcement of State laws or regulations prohibited without transfer to State of management authority by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State may enforce, or attempt to enforce, any State law or regulation relating to the taking of any species (which term for purposes of this section includes any population stock) of marine mammal within the State unless the Secretary has transferred authority for the conservation and management of that species (hereinafter referred to in this section as &ldquo;management authority&rdquo;) to the State under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings prerequisite to transfer of authority; State program; implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall transfer management authority for a species of marine mammal to a State if the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for public comment, that the State has developed and will implement a program for the conservation and management of the species that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) does not permit the taking of the species unless and until&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the State has determined, under a process consistent with the standards set forth in subsection (c) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) that the species is at its optimum sustainable population (hereinafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;OSP&rdquo;), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the maximum number of animals of that species that may be taken without reducing the species below its OSP, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the determination required under clause (i) is final and implemented under State law, and, if a cooperative allocation agreement for the species is required under subsection (d)(1) of this section, such as agreement is implemented;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) does not permit the taking of a number of animals of the species that exceeds the maximum number determined pursuant to subparagraph (C)(i)(II), and, in the case of taking for subsistence uses (as defined in subsection (f)(2) of this section), does not permit the taking of a number of animals that would be inconsistent with the maintenance of the species at its OSP;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) does not permit the taking of the species for scientific research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock, except for taking for such purposes that is undertaken by, or on behalf of, the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) provides procedures for acquiring data, and evaluating such data and other new evidence, relating to the OSP of the species, and the maximum take that would maintain the species at the level, and, if required on the basis of such evaluation, for amending determinations under subparagraph (C)(i);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) provides procedures for the resolution of differences between the State and the Sec<!-- PDFPage:1639 -->retary that might arise during the development of a cooperative allocation agreement under subsection (d)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) provides for the submission of an annual report to the Secretary regarding the administration of the program during the reporting period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the period between the transfer of management authority for a species to a State under paragraph (1) and the time at which the implementation requirements under paragraph (1)(C)(ii) are complied with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State program shall not apply with respect to the taking of the species within the State for any purpose, or under any condition, provided for under section 1371 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary shall continue to regulate, under this subchapter, all takings of the species within the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After the determination required under paragraph (1)(C)(i) regarding a species is final and implemented under State law and after a cooperative allocation agreement described in subsection (d)(1) of this section, if required, is implemented for such species&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such determination shall be treated, for purposes of applying this subchapter beyond the territory of the State, as a determination made in accordance with section 1373 of this title and as an applicable waiver under section 1371(a)(3) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary shall regulate, without regard to this section other than the allocations specified under such an agreement, the taking of the species&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) incidentally in the course of commercial fishing operations (whether provided for under section 1371(a)(2) or (4) of this title), or in the course of other specified activities provided for under section 1371(a)(5) of this title, in the zone described in section 1362(14)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1379_1_target" name="1379_1">1</a></sup> of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for scientific research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock (other than by, or on behalf of, the State), except that any taking authorized under a permit issued pursuant to section 1371(a)(1) of this title after October 9, 1981, allowing the removal of live animals from habitat within the State shall not be effective if the State agency disapproves, on or before the date of issuance of the permit, such taking as being inconsistent with the State program; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) section 1371(b) of this title shall not apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standards with which State process must comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State process required under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section must comply with the following standards:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The State agency with management authority for the species (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;State agency&rdquo;) must make an initial determination regarding the factors described in clause (i) of that subsection. The State agency must identify, and make available to the public under reasonable circumstances, the documentation supporting such initial determination. Unless request for a hearing under paragraph (2) regarding the initial determination is timely made, the initial determination shall be treated as final under State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The State agency shall provide opportunity, at the request of any interested party, for a hearing with respect to the initial determination made by it under paragraph (1) at which interested parties may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) present oral and written evidence in support of or against such determination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) cross-examine persons presenting evidence at the hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The State agency must give public notice of the hearing and make available to the public within a reasonable time before commencing the hearing a list of the witnesses for the State and a general description of the documentation and other evidence that will be relied upon by such witnesses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The State agency, solely on the basis of the record developed at a hearing held pursuant to paragraph (2), must make a decision regarding its initial determination under paragraph (1) and shall include with the record a statement of the findings and conclusions, and the reason or basis therefor, on all material issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Opportunity for judicial review of the decision made by the State agency on the record under paragraph (3), under scope of review equivalent to that provided for in section 706(2)(A) through (E) of title 5, must be available under State law. The Secretary may not initiate judicial review of any such decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cooperative allocation agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the range of a species with respect to which a determination under paragraph (1)(C)(i) of subsection (b) of this section is made extends beyond the territorial waters of the State, the State agency and the Secretary (who shall first coordinate with the Marine Mammal Commission and the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council established under section 1852 of this title) shall enter into a cooperative allocation agreement providing procedures for allocating, on a timely basis, such of the number of animals, as determined under paragraph (1)(C)(i)(II) of subsection (b) of this section, as may be appropriate with priority of allocation being given firstly to taking for subsistence uses in the case of the State of Alaska, and secondly to taking for purposes provided for under section 1371(a) of this title within the zone described in section 1362(14)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1379_2_target" name="1379_2">2</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the State agency requests the Secretary to regulate the taking of a species to which paragraph (1) applies within the zone described in section 1362(14)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1379_2_target" name="1379_2">2</a></sup> of this title for subsistence uses or for hunting, or both, in a manner consistent with the regulation by the State agency of such taking within the State, the Secretary shall adopt, and enforce within such zone, <!-- PDFPage:1640 -->such of the State agency's regulatory provisions as the Secretary considers to be consistent with his administration of section 1371(a) of this title within such zone. The Secretary shall adopt such provisions through the issuance of regulations under section 553 of title 5, and with respect to such issuance the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], the Paperwork Reduction Act,<sup><a href="#1379_2_target" name="1379_2">2</a></sup> Executive Order Numbered 12291, dated February 17, 1981, and the thirty-day notice requirement in subsection (d) of such section 553 shall not apply. For purposes of sections 1375, 1376, and 1377 of this title, such regulations shall be treated as having been issued under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Revocation of transfer of management authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall revoke, after opportunity for a hearing, any transfer of management authority made to a State under subsection (b)(1) of this section if the Secretary finds that the State program for the conservation and management of the species concerned is not being implemented, or is being implemented in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this section or the provisions of the program. The Secretary shall also establish a procedure for the voluntary return by a State to the Secretary of species management authority that was previously transferred to the State under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may not revoke a transfer of management authority under paragraph (1) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary provides to the State a written notice of intent to revoke together with a statement, in detail, of those actions, or failures to act, on which such intent is based; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the State does not take such remedial measures as are necessary, in the judgment of the Secretary, to bring its conservation and management program, or the administration or enforcement of the program, into compliance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When a revocation by the Secretary of a transfer of management authority to a State becomes final, or the State voluntarily returns management authority to the Secretary, the Secretary shall regulate the taking, and provide for the conservation and management, of the species within the State in accordance with the provisions of this chapter (and in the case of Alaskan Natives, section 1371(b) of this title and subsection (i) of this section shall apply upon such revocation or return of management authority).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of management authority to State of Alaska</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may not transfer management authority to the State of Alaska under subsection (b)(1) of this section for any species of marine mammal unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State has adopted and will implement a statute and regulations that insure that the taking of the species for subsistence uses&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is accomplished in a nonwasteful manner,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) will be the priority consumptive use of the species, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if required to be restricted, such restriction will be based upon&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the customary and direct dependence upon the species as the mainstay of livelihood,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) local residency, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) the availability of alternative resources; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State has adopted a statute or regulation that requires that any consumptive use of marine mammal species, other than for subsistence uses, will be authorized during a regulatory year only if the appropriate agency first makes findings, based on an administrative record before it, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such use will have no significant adverse impact upon subsistence uses of the species, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the regulation of such use, including, but not limited to, licensing of marine mammal hunting guides and the assignment of guiding areas, will, to the maximum extent practicable, provide economic opportunities for the residents of the rural coastal villages of Alaska who engage in subsistence uses of that species.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;subsistence uses&rdquo; means the customary and traditional uses by rural Alaska residents of marine mammals for direct personal or family consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation; for the making and selling of handicraft articles out of nonedible byproducts of marine mammals taken for personal or family consumption; and for barter, or sharing for personal or family consumption. As used in this paragraph&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Environmental impact statement not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither the transfer of management authority to a State under subsection (b)(1) of this section, nor the revocation or voluntary return of such authority under subsection (e) of this section, shall be deemed to be an action for which an environmental impact statement is required under section 4332 of title 42.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1641 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Taking of marine mammals as part of official duties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this subchapter or subchapter V of this chapter shall prevent a Federal, State, or local government official or employee or a person designated under section 1382(c) of this title from taking, in the course of his or her duties as an official, employee, or designee, a marine mammal in a humane manner (including euthanasia) if such taking is for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the protection or welfare of the mammal,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the protection of the public health and welfare, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the nonlethal removal of nuisance animals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the Secretary or a person designated under section 1382(c) of this title from importing a marine mammal into the United States if such importation is necessary to render medical treatment that is not otherwise available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which it is feasible to return to its natural habitat a marine mammal taken or imported under circumstances described in this subsection, steps to achieve that result shall be taken.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Regulations covering taking of marine mammals by Alaskan natives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may (after providing notice thereof in the Federal Register and in newspapers of general circulation, and through appropriate electronic media, in the affected area and providing opportunity for a hearing thereon in such area) prescribe regulations requiring the marking, tagging, and reporting of animals taken pursuant to section 1371(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Grants to develop or administer State conservation and management programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make grants to States to assist them&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) publish in the Federal Register not later than one hundred and twenty days after November 23, 1988, a final list of the fisheries and other information required by paragraph (A), together with a summary of the provisions of this section and information sufficient to advise vessel owners on how to obtain an exemption and otherwise comply with the requirements of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) at least once each year thereafter, and at such other times as the Secretary considers appropriate, reexamine, based on information gathered from the program established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, and other relevant sources and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the classification of fisheries and other determinations required under subparagraph (A) and publish in the Federal Register any necessary changes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An exemption shall be granted by the Secretary in accordance with this section for a vessel engaged in a fishery identified under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii), upon receipt by the Secretary of a completed registration form providing the name of the vessel owner, the name and description of the vessel, the fisheries in which it will be engaged, and such other information as the Secretary considers necessary. A decal or other physical evidence that the exemption is current and valid shall be issued by the Secretary at the time an exemption is granted, and so long as the exemption remains current and valid, shall be reissued annually thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No exemption may be granted under this section to the owner of a vessel unless such vessel&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is a vessel of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) has a valid fishing permit issued by the Secretary in accordance with section 1824(b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, exemptions granted under this section shall authorize the incidental taking of marine mammals, other than California sea otters, from any species or stock, including a pop<!-- PDFPage:1646 -->ulation stock designated as depleted, but shall not authorize the intentional lethal taking of any Steller sea lion, any cetacean, or any marine mammals from a population stock designated as depleted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Beginning two hundred and forty days after November 23, 1988, each owner of a vessel engaged in any fishery identified under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii) shall, in order to engage lawfully in that fishery&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) have registered with the Secretary in order to obtain for each such vessel owned an exemption for the purpose of incidentally taking marine mammals in accordance with this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) ensure that a decal or such other physical evidence of a current and valid exemption as the Secretary may require is displayed on or is in the possession of the master of each such vessel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) report as required by subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any owner of a vessel receiving an exemption under this section for any fishery identified under paragraph (1)(A)(i) shall, as a condition of that exemption, take on board a natural resource observer if requested to do so by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An owner of a vessel engaged in a fishery identified under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii) who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) fails to obtain from the Secretary an exemption under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) fails to maintain a current and valid exemption; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) fails to ensure that a decal or other physical evidence of such exemption issued by the Secretary is displayed on or is in possession of the master of the vessel,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and the master of any such vessel engaged in such fishery, shall be deemed to have violated this subchapter, and shall be subject to the penalties of this subchapter except in the case of unknowing violations before January 1, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the owner of a vessel has obtained and maintains a current and valid exemption from the Secretary under this section and meets the requirements set forth in this section, the owner of such vessel, and the master and crew members of the vessel, shall not be subject to the penalties set forth in this subchapter for the incidental taking of marine mammals while such vessel is engaged in a fishery to which the exemption applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Each owner of a vessel engaged in any fishery not identified in paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii), and the master and crew members of such a vessel, shall not be subject to the penalties set forth in this subchapter for the incidental taking of marine mammals if such owner reports to the Secretary, in such form and manner as the Secretary may require, instances of lethal incidental taking in the course of that fishery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall suspend or revoke an exemption granted under this section and shall not issue a decal or other physical evidence of the exemption for any vessel until the owner of such vessel complies with the reporting requirements under subsection (c) of this section and such requirements to take on board a natural resource observer under paragraph (3)(B) as are applicable to such vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with the appropriate States, Regional Fishery Management Councils, and other interested parties, the means by which the granting and administration of exemptions under this section shall be integrated and coordinated, to the maximum extent practicable, with existing fishery licenses, registrations, and related programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall utilize newspapers of general circulation, fishery trade associations, electronic media, and other means of advising commercial fishermen of the provisions of this section and the means by which they can comply with its requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary is authorized to charge a fee for the granting of an exemption under this subsection. The level of fees charged under this subparagraph shall not exceed the administrative costs incurred in granting an exemption. Fees collected under this subparagraph shall be available to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere for expenses incurred in the granting and administration of exemptions under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compilation of information by vessel owners; contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner of each vessel holding an exemption granted under subsection (b) of this section shall regularly compile information which shall be used in a report to be submitted to the Secretary at the close of the fishing season or annually, as the Secretary may prescribe. Such report shall be submitted in such form as the Secretary may require and shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the type of fishery engaged in by the owner's vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the date and approximate time of any incidental taking of a marine mammal, together with the area in which the incidental taking occurred, the fishing gear used at the time of the incidental taking, and the species of fish involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for each incidental taking, the number and species of marine mammals involved, whether the marine mammals were deterred from gear or catch, incidentally injured, incidentally killed, or lethally removed to protect gear, catch, or human life.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If there was no incidental taking of marine mammals during the reporting period, a report stating that fact shall be filed with the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Program for enhancement and verification of information received from vessel owners; confidentiality of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish a program to enhance the quality of and verify information received from reports submitted by owners of vessels who have been granted an exemption under subsection (b) of this section. The program shall include, but not be limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) education efforts regarding the information that must be submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) interviews with fishermen; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) other such information gathering and verification activities that will enable the Secretary to determine reliably the nature, <!-- PDFPage:1647 -->type, and extent of the incidental taking of marine mammals that occurs in a fishery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except to the extent authorized by the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, the program shall not include placement of observers aboard exempted vessels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Information obtained under this subsection shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Observers on board exempted vessels; confidentiality of information; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For each fishery identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section, the Secretary shall, after consultation with the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, other Federal and State agencies, and other interested parties, and subject to paragraph (6), place observers on board exempted vessels so as to monitor not less than 20 percent nor more than 35 percent of the fishing operations by vessels in the fishery to obtain statistically reliable information on the species and number of marine mammals incidentally taken in the fishery. If the Secretary determines that fewer than 20 percent of the fishing operations by vessels in the fishery will be monitored during the course of the fishing season, the Secretary shall implement the alternative observation program described in subsection (f) of this section to the extent necessary to supplement the observer program described in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When determining the distribution of observers among fisheries and between vessels in a particular fishery, the Secretary shall be guided by the following standards:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the requirement to obtain the best scientific information available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the requirement that assignment of observers is fair and equitable among fisheries and among vessels in a fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) consistent with paragraph (1), the requirement that no individual person or vessel, or group of persons or vessels, be subject to excessive or overly burdensome observer coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) where practicable, the need to minimize costs and avoid duplication.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary finds that, for reasons beyond his or her control, the Secretary cannot assign observers to all the fisheries identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section at the level of observer coverage set forth in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall allocate available observers among such fisheries, consistent with paragraph (2), according to the following priority:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) those fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals from any population stock designated as depleted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) those fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals from population stocks that the Secretary believes are declining;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) those fisheries other than those described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) in which the greatest incidental take of marine mammals occur; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any other fishery identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may, with the consent of the vessel owner, station an observer on board a vessel engaged in a fishery not identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Information gathered by observers shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (j) of this section. Consistent with the requirements of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, if requested by the Appropriate&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1383a_1_target" name="1383a_1">1</a></sup> Regional Fishery Management Council, or in the case of a State fishery, the State, require observers to collect additional information, including but not limited to the quantities, species, and physical condition of target and non-target fishery resources and, if requested by the Secretary of the Interior, seabirds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (4), the Secretary may decline to require observers to collect information described in such paragraph, if the Secretary finds in writing, following public notice and opportunity for comment, that such information will not contribute to the protection of marine mammals or the understanding of the marine ecosystem, including fishery resources and seabirds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary shall not be required to place an observer on a vessel in a fishery if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in a situation where harvesting vessels are delivering fish to a processing vessel and the catch is not taken on board the harvesting vessel, statistically reliable information can be obtained from an observer on board the processing vessel to which the fish are delivered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the facilities of a vessel for the quartering of an observer, or for carrying out observer functions, are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for reasons beyond the control of the Secretary, an observer is not available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) An observer on a vessel (or the observer's personal representative) under the requirements of this section or section 1374 of this title that is ill, disabled, injured, or killed from service as an observer on that vessel may not bring a civil action under any law of the United States for that illness, disability, injury, or death against the vessel or vessel owner, except that a civil action may be brought against the vessel owner for the owner's willful misconduct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph does not apply if the observer is engaged by the owner, master, or individual in charge of a vessel to perform any duties in service to the vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Commerce for the purposes of carrying out this subsection not to exceed $2,700,000 for fiscal year 1989 and not to exceed $8,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Alternative observation program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish an alternative observation program to provide statistically reliable information on the species and number of marine mammals incidentally taken in those fisheries identified pursuant to sub<!-- PDFPage:1648 -->section (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section for which the required level of observer coverage has not been met or for any other fisheries about which such reliable information is not otherwise available. The alternative program shall include, but not be limited to, direct observation of fishing activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Individuals engaged in the alternative observation program shall collect scientific information on the fisheries subject to observation, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (1) and subsection (e)(4) and (5) of this section. All information collected shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Review of information and evaluation of effects of incidental taking on population stocks of marine mammals; promulgation of emergency regulations to mitigate immediate and significant adverse impacts; action to mitigate non-immediate impacts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall review information regarding the incidental taking of marine mammals and evaluate the effects of such incidental taking on the affected population stocks of marine mammals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary finds, based on the information received from the programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is having an immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population stock or, in the case of Steller sea lions and North Pacific fur seals, that more than 1,350 and 50, respectively, will be incidentally killed during a calendar year, the Secretary shall consult with appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils and State fishery managers and prescribe emergency regulations to prevent to the maximum extent practicable any further taking. Any emergency regulations prescribed under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid interfering with existing State or regional fishery management plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be published in the Federal Register together with the reasons therefor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall remain in effect for not more than one hundred and eighty days or until the end of the fishing season, whichever is earlier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) may be terminated by the Secretary at an earlier date by publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination if the Secretary determines the reasons for the emergency regulations no longer exist.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In prescribing emergency regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account the economics of the fishery concerned and the availability of existing technology to prevent or minimize incidental taking of marine mammals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary finds, based on information received from the programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, that incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is not having an immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population stock but that it will likely have a significant adverse impact over a period of time longer than one year, the Secretary shall request the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council or State to initiate, recommend, or take such action within its authority as it considers necessary to mitigate the adverse impacts, including adjustments to requirements on fishing times or areas or the imposition of restrictions on the use of vessels or gear.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall impose appropriate conditions and restrictions on an exemption granted under subsection (b) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a Regional Fishery Management Council or State does not act in a reasonable period of time on a request made by the Secretary under paragraph (3); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for public comment that the purposes of this section would be better served by such action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Information and management system for processing and analyzing reports and information; accessibility to public</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall design and implement an information management system capable of processing and analyzing reports received from the programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, and other relevant sources, including Federal and State enforcement authorities, marine mammal stranding networks, and the marine mammal researchers. The information shall be made accessible to the public on a continuing basis, but in any case no later than six months after it is received, subject to the provisions of subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Utilization of services of State and Federal agencies and private entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities under subsections (b), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this section, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize the services and programs of State agencies, Federal agencies (including programs established by Regional Fishery Management Councils), marine fisheries commissions, universities, and private entities, on a reimbursable basis or otherwise. The Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts and agreements to carry out his or her responsibilities and shall establish appropriate guidelines to ensure that other programs used or contracted for will meet the same standards as a program established by the Secretary. A person contracting with the Secretary to provide observer services under subsection (e) of this section must provide evidence of financial responsibility in an amount and form prescribed by the Secretary to compensate employees (or their survivors) adequately for any illness, disability, injury, or death from service on a vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Confidentiality of information; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any information collected under subsection (c), (d), (e), (f), or (h) of this section shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to Federal employees whose duties require access to such information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to State employees pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary that prevents public disclosure of the identity or business of any person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) when required by court order; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1649 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of scientific information involving fisheries, to employees of Regional Fishery Management Councils who are responsible for fishery management plan development and monitoring.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as may be necessary to preserve such confidentiality, except that the Secretary shall release or make public any such information in aggregate, summary, or other form which does not directly or indirectly disclose the identity or business of any person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with any other Federal agency to the extent that such agency may be affected, shall prescribe such regulations as necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Suggested regime governing incidental taking of marine mammals following termination of interim exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Chairman of the Marine Mammal Commission shall, after consultation with interested parties and not later than February 1, 1990, transmit to the Secretary and make available to the public recommended guidelines to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations, other than those subject to section 1374(h)(2) of this title, after October 1, 1993. Such guidelines shall be developed by the Commission and its Committee of Scientific Advisers on Marine Mammals and shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be designed to provide a scientific rationale and basis for determining how many marine mammals may be incidentally taken under a regime to be adopted to govern such taking after October 1, 1993;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be based on sound principles of wildlife management, and be consistent with and in furtherance of the purposes and policies set forth in this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to the maximum extent practicable, include as factors to be considered and utilized in determining permissible levels of such taking&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinations by rule; notice and hearing; findings; final rule on status of species or stock involved</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any action by the Secretary to determine if a species or stock should be designated as depleted, or should no longer be designated as depleted, regardless of whether such action is taken on the initiative of the Secretary or in response to a petition for a status review, the Secretary shall only make such a determination by issuance of a rule, after notice and opportunity for public comment and after a call for information in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall make any determination described in paragraph (1) solely on the basis of the best scientific information available. Prior to the issuance of a proposed rule concerning any such determination, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a call to assist the Secretary in obtaining scientific information from individuals and organizations concerned with the conservation of marine mammals, from persons in any industry which might be affected by the determination, and from academic institutions. In addition, the Secretary shall utilize, to the extent the Secretary determines to be feasible, informal working groups of interested parties and other methods to gather the necessary information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the Secretary receives a petition for a status review as described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register that such a petition has been received and is available for public review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within sixty days after receipt of the petition, the Secretary shall publish a finding in the Federal Register as to whether the petition presents substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Secretary makes a positive finding under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall include in the Federal Register notice, a finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a review of the status of the species or stock will be commenced promptly; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a prompt review of the petition is precluded by other pending status determination petitions and that expeditious progress is being made to process pending status determination petitions under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In no case after making a finding under this subparagraph shall the Secretary delay commencing a review of the status of a species or stock for more than one hundred and twenty days after receipt of the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) No later than two hundred and ten days after the receipt of the petition, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a proposed rule as to the status of the species or stock, along with the reasons underlying the proposed status determination. Persons shall have at least sixty days to submit comments on such a proposed rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Not later than ninety days after the close of the comment period on a proposed rule issued under subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall issue a final rule on the status of the species or stock involved, along with the reasons for the status determination. If the Secretary finds with respect to such a proposed rule that there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available information relevant to a status determination, the Secretary may delay the issuance of a final rule for a period of not more than six months for purposes of soliciting additional information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph and section 553 of title 5, the Secretary may issue a final rule as to the status of a species or stock any time sixty or more days after a positive finding under subparagraph <!-- PDFPage:1651 -->(B) if the Secretary determines there is substantial information available to warrant such final status determination and further delay would pose a significant risk to the well-being of any species or stock. Along with the final rule, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register detailed reasons for the expedited determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conservation plans; preparation and implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall prepare conservation plans&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) By&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1383b_1_target" name="1383b_1">1</a></sup> December 31, 1989, for North Pacific fur seals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by December 31, 1990, for Steller sea lions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as soon as possible, for any species or stock designated as depleted under this subchapter, except that a conservation plan need not be prepared if the Secretary determines that it will not promote the conservation of the species or stock.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each plan shall have the purpose of conserving and restoring the species or stock to its optimum sustainable population. The Secretary shall model such plans on recovery plans required under section 1533(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall act expeditiously to implement each conservation plan prepared under paragraph (1). Each year, the Secretary shall specify in the annual report prepared under section 1373(f) of this title what measures have been taken to prepare and implement such plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary determines that a take reduction plan is necessary to reduce the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations from a strategic stock, or for species or stocks which interact with a commercial fishery for which the Secretary has made a determination under section 1387(f)(1) of this title, any conservation plan prepared under this subsection for such species or stock shall incorporate the take reduction plan required under section 1387 of this title for such species or stock.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) dolphins and other marine mammals are frequently killed in the course of tuna fishing operations in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and high seas driftnet fishing in other parts of the world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is the policy of the United States to support a worldwide ban on high seas driftnet fishing, in part because of the harmful effects that such driftnets have on marine mammals, including dolphins; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consumers would like to know if the tuna they purchase is falsely labeled as to the effect of the harvesting of the tuna on dolphins.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the terms &ldquo;driftnet&rdquo; and &ldquo;driftnet fishing&rdquo; have the meanings given those terms in section 4003 of the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 (16 U.S.C. 1822 note);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;eastern tropical Pacific Ocean&rdquo; means the area of the Pacific Ocean bounded by 40 degrees north latitude, 40 degrees south latitude, 160 degrees west longitude, and the western coastlines of North, Central, and South America;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;label&rdquo; means a display of written, printed, or graphic matter on or affixed to the immediate container of any article;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the term &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; means the Secretary of Commerce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the term &ldquo;tuna product&rdquo; means a food item which contains tuna and which has been processed for retail sale, except perishable sandwiches, salads, or other products with a shelf life of less than 3 days.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Labeling standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is a violation of section 45 of title 15 for any producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or seller of any tuna product that is exported from or offered for sale in the United States to include on the label of that product the term &ldquo;dolphin safe&rdquo; or any other term or symbol that falsely claims or suggests that the tuna contained in the product were harvested using a method of fishing that is not harmful to dolphins if the product contains tuna harvested&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on the high seas by a vessel engaged in driftnet fishing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) outside the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using purse seine nets&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in a fishery in which the Secretary has determined that a regular and significant association occurs between dolphins and tuna (similar to the association between dolphins and tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean), unless such product is accompanied by a written statement, executed by the captain of the vessel and an observer participating in a national or international program acceptable to the Secretary, certifying that no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on or used to encircle dolphins during the particular voyage on which the tuna were caught and no dolphins were killed or seriously injured in the sets in which the tuna were caught; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in any other fishery (other than a fishery described in subparagraph (D)) unless the product is accompanied by a written statement executed by the captain of the vessel certifying that no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on or used to encircle dolphins during the particular voyage on which the tuna was harvested;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using a purse seine net unless the tuna meet the requirements for being considered dolphin safe under paragraph (2); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) by a vessel in a fishery other than one described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) that is identified by the Secretary as having a regular and significant mortality or serious injury of dolphins, unless such product is accompanied by a written statement executed by the captain of the vessel and an observer participating in a national or international program acceptable to the Secretary that no dolphins were killed or seriously injured in the sets or other gear deployments in which the tuna were caught, provided that the Secretary determines that such an observer statement is necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), a tuna product that contains tuna harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using purse seine nets is dolphin safe if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the vessel is of a type and size that the Secretary has determined, consistent with the International Dolphin Conservation Program, is not capable of deploying its purse seine nets on or to encircle dolphins; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the product is accompanied by a written statement executed by the captain providing the certification required under subsection (h) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the product is accompanied by a written statement executed by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the Secretary or the Secretary's designee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) a representative of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) an authorized representative of a participating nation whose national program meets the requirements of the International Dolphin Conservation Program,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">which states that there was an observer approved by the International Dolphin Conservation Program on board the vessel during the entire trip and that such observer provided the certification required under subsection (h) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the statements referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) are endorsed in writing by each exporter, importer, and processor of the product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the written statements and endorsements referred to in subparagraph (B) comply with regulations promulgated by the Secretary which provide for the verification of tuna products as dolphin safe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary of Commerce shall develop an official mark that may be used to label <!-- PDFPage:1653 -->tuna products as dolphin safe in accordance with this Act.<sup><a href="#1385_1_target" name="1385_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A tuna product that bears the dolphin safe mark developed under subparagraph (A) shall not bear any other label or mark that refers to dolphins, porpoises, or marine mammals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) It is a violation of section 45 of title 15 to label a tuna product with any label or mark that refers to dolphins, porpoises, or marine mammals other than the mark developed under subparagraph (A) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) no dolphins were killed or seriously injured in the sets or other gear deployments in which the tuna were caught;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the label is supported by a tracking and verification program which is comparable in effectiveness to the program established under subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the label complies with all applicable labeling, marketing, and advertising laws and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission, including any guidelines for environmental labeling.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall allocate observers among commercial fisheries in accordance with the following priority:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The highest priority for allocation shall be for commercial fisheries that have incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals from stocks listed as endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The second highest priority for allocation shall be for commercial fisheries that have incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals from strategic stocks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The third highest priority for allocation shall be for commercial fisheries that have incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals from stocks for which the level of incidental mortality and serious injury is uncertain.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may establish an alternative observer program to provide statistically reliable information on the species and number of marine mammals incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations. The alternative observer program may include direct observation of fishing activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary is not required to place an observer on a vessel in a fishery if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in a situation in which harvesting vessels are delivering fish to a processing vessel and the catch is not taken on board the harvesting vessel, statistically reliable information can be obtained from an observer on board the processing vessel to which the fish are delivered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the facilities on a vessel for quartering of an observer, or for carrying out observer functions, are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as may be necessary to preserve such confidentiality, except that the Secretary shall release or make public upon request any such information in aggregate, summary, or other form which does not directly or indirectly disclose the identity or business of any person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner or operator of a commercial fishing vessel subject to this chapter shall report all incidental mortality and injury of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations to the Secretary by mail or other means acceptable to the Secretary within 48 hours after the end of each fishing trip on a standard postage-paid form to be developed by the Secretary under this section. Such form shall be capable of being readily entered into and usable by an automated or computerized data processing system and shall require the vessel owner or operator to provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The vessel name, and Federal, State, or tribal registration numbers of the registered vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The name and address of the vessel owner or operator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The name and description of the fishery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The species of each marine mammal incidentally killed or injured, and the date, time, and approximate geographic location of such occurrence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Take reduction plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall develop and implement a take reduction plan designed to assist in the recovery or prevent the depletion of each strategic stock which interacts with a commercial fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of this section, and may develop and implement such a plan for any other marine mammal <!-- PDFPage:1659 -->stocks which interact with a commercial fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section which the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for public comment, has a high level of mortality and serious injury across a number of such marine mammal stocks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The immediate goal of a take reduction plan for a strategic stock shall be to reduce, within 6 months of its implementation, the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to levels less than the potential biological removal level established for that stock under section 1386 of this title. The long-term goal of the plan shall be to reduce, within 5 years of its implementation, the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate, taking into account the economics of the fishery, the availability of existing technology, and existing State or regional fishery management plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If there is insufficient funding available to develop and implement a take reduction plan for all such stocks that interact with commercial fisheries listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary shall give highest priority to the development and implementation of take reduction plans for species or stocks whose level of incidental mortality and serious injury exceeds the potential biological removal level, those that have a small population size, and those which are declining most rapidly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each take reduction plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a review of the information in the final stock assessment published under section 1386(b) of this title and any substantial new information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an estimate of the total number and, if possible, age and gender, of animals from the stock that are being incidentally lethally taken or seriously injured each year during the course of commercial fishing operations, by fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) recommended regulatory or voluntary measures for the reduction of incidental mortality and serious injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) recommended dates for achieving the specific objectives of the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For any stock in which incidental mortality and serious injury from commercial fisheries exceeds the potential biological removal level established under section 1386 of this title, the plan shall include measures the Secretary expects will reduce, within 6 months of the plan's implementation, such mortality and serious injury to a level below the potential biological removal level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For any stock in which human-caused mortality and serious injury exceeds the potential biological removal level, other than a stock to which subparagraph (A) applies, the plan shall include measures the Secretary expects will reduce, to the maximum extent practicable within 6 months of the plan's implementation, the incidental mortality and serious injury by such commercial fisheries from that stock. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;maximum extent practicable&rdquo; means to the lowest level that is feasible for such fisheries within the 6-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) At the earliest possible time (not later than 30 days) after the Secretary issues a final stock assessment under section 1386(b) of this title for a strategic stock, the Secretary shall, and for stocks that interact with a fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section for which the Secretary has made a determination under paragraph (1), the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) establish a take reduction team for such stock and appoint the members of such team in accordance with subparagraph (C); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) publish in the Federal Register a notice of the team's establishment, the names of the team's appointed members, the full geographic range of such stock, and a list of all commercial fisheries that cause incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals from such stock.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may request a take reduction team to address a stock that extends over one or more regions or fisheries, or multiple stocks within a region or fishery, if the Secretary determines that doing so would facilitate the development and implementation of plans required under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Members of take reduction teams shall have expertise regarding the conservation or biology of the marine mammal species which the take reduction plan will address, or the fishing practices which result in the incidental mortality and serious injury of such species. Members shall include representatives of Federal agencies, each coastal State which has fisheries which interact with the species or stock, appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, interstate fisheries commissions, academic and scientific organizations, environmental groups, all commercial and recreational fisheries groups and gear types which incidentally take the species or stock, Alaska Native organizations or Indian tribal organizations, and others as the Secretary deems appropriate. Take reduction teams shall, to the maximum extent practicable, consist of an equitable balance among representatives of resource user interests and nonuser interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Take reduction teams shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 App. U.S.C.). Meetings of take reduction teams shall be open to the public, and prior notice of meetings shall be made public in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Members of take reduction teams shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed by the Secretary, upon request, for reasonable travel costs and expenses incurred in performing their duties as members of the team.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Where the human-caused mortality and serious injury from a strategic stock is estimated to be equal to or greater than the potential biological removal level established under section 1386 of this title for such stock and such stock interacts with a fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of this section, the following procedures shall apply in the development of the take reduction plan for the stock:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) Not later than 6 months after the date of establishment of a take reduction team for the stock, the team shall submit a draft take <!-- PDFPage:1660 -->reduction plan for such stock to the Secretary, consistent with the other provisions of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The Secretary shall amend the take reduction plan and implementing regulations as necessary to meet the requirements of this section, in accordance with the procedures in this section for the issuance of such plans and regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Where the human-caused mortality and serious injury from a strategic stock is estimated to be less than the potential biological removal level established under section 1386 of this title for such stock and such stock interacts with a fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of this section, or for any marine mammal stocks which interact with a commercial fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section for which the Secretary has made a determination under paragraph (1), the following procedures shall apply in the development of the take reduction plan for such stock:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) Not later than 11 months after the date of establishment of a take reduction team for the stock, the team shall submit a draft take reduction plan for the stock to the Secretary, consistent with the other provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Such draft take reduction plan shall be developed by consensus. In the event consensus cannot be reached, the team shall advise the Secretary in writing on the range of possibilities considered by the team, and the views of both the majority and minority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The Secretary shall take the draft take reduction plan into consideration and, not later than 60 days after the submission of the draft plan by the team, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the plan proposed by the team, any changes proposed by the Secretary with an explanation of the reasons therefor, and proposed regulations to implement such plan, for public review and comment during a period of not to exceed 90 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) In the event that the take reduction team does not submit a draft plan to the Secretary within 11 months, the Secretary shall, not later than 13 months after the establishment of the team, publish in the Federal Register a proposed take reduction plan and implementing regulations, for public review and comment during a period of not to exceed 90 days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) monitor, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, the effectiveness of measures taken to reduce the level of incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(10)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (6), in the case of any stock to which paragraph (1) applies for which a final stock assessment has not been published under section 1386(b)(3) of this title by April 1, 1995, due to a proceeding under section 1386(b)(2) of this title, or any Federal court review of such proceeding, the Secretary shall establish a take reduction team under paragraph (6) for such stock as if a final stock assessment had been published.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The draft stock assessment published for such stock under section 1386(b)(1) of this title shall be deemed the final stock assessment for purposes of preparing and implementing a take reduction plan for such stock under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon publication of a final stock assessment for such stock under section 1386(b)(3) of this title the Secretary shall immediately reconvene the take reduction team for such stock for the purpose of amending the take reduction plan, and any regulations issued to implement such plan, if necessary, to reflect the final stock assessment or court action.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Pinniped removal authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may permit the intentional lethal taking of pinnipeds in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A State may apply to the Secretary to authorize the intentional lethal taking of individually identifiable pinnipeds which are having a significant negative impact on the decline or recovery of salmonid fishery stocks which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) have been listed as threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary finds are approaching threatened species or endangered species status (as those terms are defined in that Act); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) migrate through the Ballard Locks at Seattle, Washington.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such application shall include a means of identifying the individual pinniped or pinnipeds, and shall include a detailed description of the problem interaction and expected benefits of the taking.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions in response to application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 15 days of receiving an application, the Secretary shall determine whether the application has produced sufficient evidence to warrant establishing a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force to address the situation described in the application. If the Secretary determines sufficient evidence has been provided, the Secretary shall establish a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force and publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public comment on the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force established under paragraph (1) shall consist of designated employees of the Department of Commerce, scientists who are knowledgeable about the pinniped interaction that the application addresses, representatives of affected conservation and fishing community organizations, Indian Treaty tribes, the States, and such other organizations as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 60 days after establishment, and after reviewing public comments in response to the Federal Register notice under paragraph (1), the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) recommend to the Secretary whether to approve or deny the proposed intentional lethal taking of the pinniped or pinnipeds, including along with the recommendation a description of the specific pinniped individual or individuals, the proposed location, time, and method of such taking, criteria for evaluating the success of the action, and the duration of the intentional lethal taking authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) suggest nonlethal alternatives, if available and practicable, including a recommended course of action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within 30 days after receipt of recommendations from the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force, the Secretary shall either approve or deny the application. If such application is approved, the Secretary shall immediately take steps to implement the intentional lethal taking, which shall be performed by Federal or State agencies, or qualified individuals under contract to such agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) After implementation of an approved application, the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force shall evaluate the effectiveness of the permitted intentional lethal taking or alternative actions implemented. If implementation was ineffective in eliminating the problem interaction, the Task Force shall recommend additional actions. If the implementation was effective, the Task Force shall so advise the Secretary, and the Secretary shall disband the Task Force.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In considering whether an application should be approved or denied, the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force and the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) population trends, feeding habits, the location of the pinniped interaction, how and when the interaction occurs, and how many individual pinnipeds are involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) past efforts to nonlethally deter such pinnipeds, and whether the applicant has demonstrated that no feasible and prudent alternatives exist and that the applicant has taken all reasonable nonlethal steps without success;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which such pinnipeds are causing undue injury or impact to, or imbalance with, other species in the ecosystem, including fish populations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent to which such pinnipeds are exhibiting behavior that presents an ongoing threat to public safety.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not approve the intentional lethal taking of any pinniped from a species or stock that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) listed as a threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) depleted under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a strategic stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals; investigation and report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall engage in a scientific investigation to determine whether California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are having a significant negative impact on the recovery of salmonid fishery stocks which have been listed as endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), or which the Secretary finds are approaching such endangered species or threatened species status; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are having broader impacts on the coastal ecosystems of Washington, Oregon, and California.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall conclude this investigation and prepare a report on its results no later than October 1, 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon completion of the scientific investigation required under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall enter into discussions with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, on <!-- PDFPage:1664 -->behalf of the States of Washington, Oregon, and California, for the purpose of addressing any issues or problems identified as a result of the scientific investigation, and to develop recommendations to address such issues or problems. Any recommendations resulting from such discussions shall be submitted, along with the report, to the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The amounts appropriated under section 4107(c) of this title and allocated to the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission may be used by the Commission to participate in discussions with the Secretary under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regionwide pinniped-fishery interaction study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may conduct a study, of not less than three high predation areas in anadromous fish migration corridors within the Northwest Region of the National Marine Fisheries Service, on the interaction between fish and pinnipeds. In conducting the study, the Secretary shall consult with other State and Federal agencies with expertise in pinniped-fishery interaction. The study shall evaluate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) fish behavior in the presence of predators generally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) holding times and passage rates of anadromous fish stocks in areas where such fish are vulnerable to predation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) whether additional facilities exist, or could be reasonably developed, that could improve escapement for anadromous fish; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) other issues the Secretary considers relevant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary may, not later than 18 months after the commencement of the study under this subsection, transmit a report on the results of the study to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The study conducted under this subsection may not be used by the Secretary as a reason for delaying or deferring a determination or consideration under subsection (c) or (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Gulf of Maine Task Force</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force to advise the Secretary on issues or problems regarding pinnipeds interacting in a dangerous or damaging manner with aquaculture resources in the Gulf of Maine. No later than 2 years from April 30, 1994, the Secretary shall after notice and opportunity for public comment submit to the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report containing recommended available alternatives to mitigate such interactions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Requirements applicable to task forces</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any task force established under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall to the maximum extent practicable, consist of an equitable balance among representatives of resource user interests and nonuser interests; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 App. U.S.C.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Meetings of any task force established under this section shall be open to the public, and prior notice of those meetings shall be given to the public by the task force in a timely fashion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in section 1386 of this title shall prevent the Secretary from publishing a stock assessment for Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise in an expedited fashion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In developing and implementing a take reduction plan under section 1387 of this title for Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise, the Secretary shall consider all actions already taken to reduce incidental mortality and serious injury of such stock, and may, based on the recommendations of the take reduction team for such stock, modify the time period required for compliance with section 1387(f)(5)(A) of this title, but in no case may such modification extend the date of compliance beyond April 1, 1997.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean has resulted in the deaths of millions of dolphins.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Significant awareness and increased concern for the health and safety of dolphin populations has encouraged a change in fishing methods worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) United States tuna fishing vessels have led the world in the development of fishing methods to reduce dolphin mortalities in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and United States tuna processing companies have voluntarily promoted the marketing of tuna that is dolphin safe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nations harvesting yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have demonstrated their willingness to participate in appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce dolphin mortality progressively to a level approaching zero through the setting of annual limits, with the goal of eliminating dolphin mortality in that fishery. Recognition of the International Dolphin Conservation Program will assure that the existing trend of reduced dolphin mortality continues; that individual stocks of dolphins are adequately protected; and that the goal of eliminating all dolphin mortality continues to be a priority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) eliminate the marine mammal mortality resulting from the intentional encirclement of dolphins and other marine mammals in tuna purse seine fisheries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) support the International Dolphin Conservation Program and efforts within the Program to reduce, with the goal of eliminating, the mortality referred to in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that the market of the United States does not act as an incentive to the harvest of tuna caught with driftnets or caught by purse seine vessels in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean not operating in compliance with the International Dolphin Conservation Program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) secure appropriate multilateral agreements to ensure that United States tuna fishing vessels shall have continued access to productive tuna fishing grounds in the South Pacific Ocean and elsewhere; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) encourage observer coverage on purse seine vessels fishing for tuna outside of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean in a fishery in which the Secretary has determined that a regular and significant association occurs between marine mammals and tuna, and in which tuna is harvested through the use of purse seine nets deployed on or to encircle marine mammals.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the Program shall be to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) facilitate the collection and dissemination of reference data on the health of marine mammals and health trends of marine mammal populations in the wild;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Current stranding network participants have performed an undeniably valuable and ceaseless job of responding to marine mammal strandings over the last 15 years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Insufficient understanding of the connection between marine mammal health and the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of their environment prevents an adequate understanding of the causes of marine mammal unusual mortality events.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) An accurate assessment of marine mammal health, health trends in marine mammal populations in the wild, and causes of marine mammal unusual mortality events cannot be made without adequate reference data on marine mammals and the environment in which they live.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) A systematic assessment of the sources, presence, levels, and effects of potentially harmful contaminants on marine mammals would provide a better understanding of some of the causes of marine mammal unusual mortality events and may serve as an indicator of the general health of our coastal and marine environments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Responses to marine mammal unusual mortality events are often uncoordinated, due to the lack of sufficient contingency planning.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Standardized methods for the reporting of dying, dead, or otherwise incapacitated marine mammals in the wild would greatly assist in the determination of the causes of marine mammal unusual mortality events and enhance general knowledge of marine mammal species.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) A formal system for collection, preparation, and archiving of, and providing access to, marine mammal tissues will enhance efforts to investigate the health of marine mammals and health trends of marine mammal populations, and to develop reference data.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Information on marine mammals, including results of analyses of marine mammal tissues, should be broadly available to the scientific community, including stranding network participants, through a marine mammal data base.&rdquo;</p>
