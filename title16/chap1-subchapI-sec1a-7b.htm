<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Second Amendment to the Constitution provides that &ldquo;the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Section 2.4(a)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that &ldquo;except as otherwise provided in this section and parts 7 (special regulations) and 13 (Alaska regulations), the following are prohibited: (i) Possessing a weapon, trap or net (ii) Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) Using a weapon, trap or net&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Section 27.42 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that, except in special circumstances, citizens of the United States may not &ldquo;possess, use, or transport firearms on national wildlife refuges&rdquo; of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The regulations described in paragraphs (2) and (3) prevent individuals complying with Federal and State laws from exercising the second amendment rights of the individuals while at units of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the National Park System; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the National Wildlife Refuge System.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The existence of different laws relating to the transportation and possession of firearms at different units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Although the Bush administration issued new regulations relating to the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens in units of the National Park System and National Wildlife Refuge System that went into effect on January 9, 2009&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction with respect to the implementation and enforcement of the new regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the new regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are under review by the administration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may be altered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again override the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens on 83,600,000 acres of National Park System land and 90,790,000 acres of land under the jurisdiction of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The Federal laws should make it clear that the second amendment rights of an individual at a unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System should not be infringed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protecting the right of individuals to bear arms in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior shall not promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from possessing a firearm including an assembled or functional firearm in any unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the law of the State in which the <!-- PDFPage:45 -->unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System is located.</p>
