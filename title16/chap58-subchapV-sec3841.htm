<h4 class="note-head">Availability of Funds After Fiscal Year 1987 for Conservation Reserve Program; Signup Agreement Not To Reduce Total Production Below Needed Levels</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 99&ndash;263, Mar. 24, 1986, 100 Stat. 59, provided: &ldquo;That after fiscal year 1987, funds available to the Corporation may be used to carry out section 1241(a)(1) of the Food Security Act of 1985 [16 U.S.C. 3841(a)(1)], only to such extent or in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriations Acts. The signup agreement should not reduce total production below levels needed to meet domestic needs, maintain the supply line, and provide for an adequate supply for export by either the Commodity Credit Corporation or private corporations or individuals at competitive prices; since by law the proceeds from sales become available for use by the Commodity Credit Corporation, such sales should reduce future appropriations&rdquo;.</p>
