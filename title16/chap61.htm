<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State has adopted an interstate fishery management plan for the resource to which the project applies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State has adopted fishery regulations which the Secretary has determined are consistent with any Federal fishery management plan for the species to which the project applies;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">in which case the Federal share shall not exceed 90 percent of the total estimated cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the Secretary approves or disapproves a proposal for a project, the Secretary shall promptly give written notification, including, if disapproved, a detailed explanation of the reasons for the disapproval, to the State agency submitting the proposal or, if the proposal is submitted through an interstate commission, such commission and the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of this chapter, funds apportioned under this section to any State shall be treated as having been obligated with respect to a project during the fiscal year in which the written notification of approval required under subparagraph (A) for the project proposal is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restriction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The expenditure of funds under this chapter shall be applied only to projects for which a proposal has been approved under subsection (a) of this section, except that up to $25,000 each fiscal year may be obligated for a State to carry out an agreement with the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior under which the personnel, services and equipment of the State and the Federal agency concerned will be made mutually available for the enforcement of Federal and State laws pertaining to the protection of fishery resources. If otherwise applied, such funds shall be replaced by the State before the State may receive any additional funds under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the Secretary determines that a project carried out under a proposal approved by the Secretary has been completed, or where the Secretary otherwise deems it appropriate, the Secretary shall cause to be paid to the proper authority of the State, or to the official or depository designated by the interstate commission if the State agency specifies that payment is to be made to the interstate commission, the Federal share of the project. Any payment made to an interstate commission shall be charged against the apportionment of the State concerned.</p>
