The United States&rsquo; title to the Area is confirmed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subdivisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Pueblo claims to right, title and interest of any kind, including aboriginal claims, in and to the subdivisions and property interests therein (except for land owned in fee by the Pueblo as of February 20, 2003), as well as related boundary, survey, trespass, and monetary damage claims, are permanently extinguished.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The recognition of the Pueblo's rights and interests in sections 539m to 539m&ndash;12 of this title constitutes adequate consideration for the Pueblo's agreement to the extinguishment of the Pueblo's claims in this section and the right-of-way grants contained in section 539m&ndash;7 of this title, and it is the intent of Congress that those rights and interests may only be diminished by a future Act of Congress specifically authorizing diminishment of such rights, with express reference to sections 539m to 539m&ndash;12 of this title.</p>
