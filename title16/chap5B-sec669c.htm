<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) So much, not to exceed 8 per centum, of the revenues (excluding interest accruing under section 669b(b) of this title) covered into said fund in each fiscal year as the Secretary of the Interior may estimate to be necessary for his expenses in the administration and execution of this chapter and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act [16 U.S.C. 715 et seq.] shall be deducted for that purpose, and such sum is authorized to be made available therefor until the expiration of the next succeeding fiscal year, and within sixty days after the close of such fiscal year the Secretary of the Interior shall apportion such part thereof as remains unexpended by him, if any, and make certificate thereof to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the State fish and game departments on the same basis and in the same manner as is provided as to other amounts authorized by this chapter to be apportioned among the States for such current fiscal year. The Secretary of the Interior, after making the aforesaid deduction, shall apportion, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the remainder of the revenue in said fund for each fiscal year among the several States in the following manner: One-half in the ratio which the area of each State bears to the total area of all the States, and one-half in the ratio which the number of paid hunting-license holders of each State in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which such apportionment is made, as certified to said Secretary by the State fish and game departments, bears to the total number of paid hunting-license holders of all the States. Such apportionments shall be adjusted equitably so that no State shall receive less than one-half of 1 per centum nor more than 5 per centum of the total amount apportioned. The term fiscal year as used in this chapter shall be a period of twelve consecutive months from October 1 through the succeeding September 30, except that the period for enumeration of paid hunting-license holders shall be a State's fiscal or license year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) One-half of the revenues accruing to the fund under this chapter each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year 1975) from any tax imposed on pistols, revolvers, bows, and arrows shall be apportioned among the States in proportion to the ratio that the population of each State bears to the population of all the States: <em>Provided</em>, That each State shall be apportioned not more than 3 per centum and not less than 1 per centum of such revenues and Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be apportioned one-<!-- PDFPage:1024 -->sixth of 1 per centum of such revenues. For the purpose of this subsection, population shall be determined on the basis of the latest decennial census for which figures are available, as certified by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
