<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on eminent domain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where authorized in subsection (a) of this section to acquire land or interests therein <!-- PDFPage:982 -->without the consent of the owner, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquire only such land or interests therein as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of sections 544 to 544p of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) do so only in cases where all reasonable efforts to acquire with the consent of the owner such lands, or interests therein, have failed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may not acquire without the consent of the owner lands or interests therein which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on November 17, 1986, were used primarily for educational, religious, or charitable purposes, single-family residential purposes, farming, or grazing so long as the existing character of that use is not substantially changed or permitted for change;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are located in counties with land use ordinances in which the Secretary has concurred pursuant to section 544f of this title, unless such lands are being used, or are in imminent danger of being used, in a manner incompatible with such ordinances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) are within the boundaries of the Dodson/Warrendale Special Purchase Unit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) are owned by an Indian tribe, held in trust by the United States for an Indian tribe or member of an Indian tribe, or otherwise administered by the United States for the benefit of an Indian tribe or member of an Indian tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Hardship cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In exercising authority to acquire lands pursuant to this section the Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by any person or entity owning any land, or interest in land, within the boundaries of a special management area.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Land exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized and directed, in conformance with the provisions of this subsection, to acquire by exchange any parcel of unimproved forest land at least forty acres in size within the boundaries of the special management areas which is owned by any private forest land owner if, after November 17, 1986, but within one hundred and eighty days after final adoption of the management plan, such private forest land owner offers to the United States such parcel of forest land.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In exercising this authority to acquire forest lands pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary may accept title to such lands and convey to the owner federally owned lands deemed appropriate by the Secretary within the States of Oregon and Washington, regardless of the State in which the transferred lands are located.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the intention of Congress that land exchanges pursuant to this subsection shall be completed no later than five years after November 17, 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the event that exchanges authorized by this section leave any private forest land owner with ownership of an uneconomic remnant of forest land contiguous to a special management area, the Secretary is authorized to acquire such forest lands as if they were within the boundaries of a special management area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The following-described Federal lands and interests therein are hereby identified as candidate lands for exchanges conducted pursuant to this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the determination of which candidate lands will be exchanged, and in what sequence, shall be at the discretion of the Secretary. Subject to valid existing rights, such lands are hereby withdrawn from all forms of entry or appropriation or disposal under the public land laws, and from location, entry, and patent under the United States mining law, and from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing and all amendments thereto until the Secretary determines such lands are no longer needed to complete exchanges authorized by this section: <em>Provided</em>, That such period shall not extend beyond five years:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Interim acquisition authority and injunctive relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the concurrence by the Secretary of land use ordinances prescribed by section 544f of this title and the approval by the Commission of land use ordinances prescribed by section 544e of this title, the following authorities are granted:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary may acquire by condemnation any land or interest which is being used or threatened to be used in a manner inconsistent with the purposes for which the scenic area was established and which will cause or is likely to cause impacts adversely affecting the scenic, cultural, recreation, and natural resources of the scenic area: <em>Provided</em>, That no lands or interests therein can be acquired by condemnation pursuant to this section if used in the same manner and for the same purposes as used on November 17, 1986, unless such land is used for or interest is in the development of sand, gravel, or crushed rock, or the disposal of refuse: <em>Provided further</em>, That within thirty days of the filing by the Secretary of a complaint for condemnation of any land or interest in the scenic area, outside of the special management areas and urban areas, the Commission, by a vote of two-thirds of its membership including a majority of the members appointed from each State, or if the Commission is not in existence the Governor of the State in which the land or interest is located, may disapprove such proposed complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Upon or after the commencement of any action for condemnation pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary, acting through the Attorney General of the United States, may apply to the appropriate United States District Court for a temporary restraining order or injunction to prohibit the use of any property within the scenic area, but outside of urban areas, which will cause or is likely to cause impacts adversely affecting the scenic, cultural, recreation and natural resources of the scenic area or is otherwise inconsistent with the purposes for which the scenic area was established. During the period of such order or injunction, the Secretary shall diligently and in good faith negotiate with the owner of the property to assure that, following termination of the order or injunction, the inconsistent use is abated or the adverse effect is mitigated.</p>
