<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In recognition of the past use of the National Park System units and wilderness areas designed under this Act by Indian people for traditional cultural and religious purposes, the Secretary shall ensure access to such park system units and wilderness areas by Indian people for such traditional cultural and religious purposes. In implementing this section, the Secretary, upon the request of an Indian tribe or Indian religious community, shall temporarily close to the general public use of one or more specific portions of the park system unit or wilderness area in order to protect the privacy of traditional cultural and religious activities in such areas by Indian people. Any such closure shall be made to affect the smallest practicable area for the minimum period necessary for such purposes. Such access shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of Public Law 95&ndash;341 (42 U.S.C. 1996 [,&nbsp;1996a]) commonly referred to as the &ldquo;American Indian Religious Freedom Act&rdquo;, and with respect to areas designated as wilderness, the Wilderness Act (78 Stat. 890; 16 U.S.C. 1131).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Study</h4>
