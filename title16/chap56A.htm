Should United States action be required to meet Treaty obligations to Canada in respect to treaty Indian fisheries conducted in terminal areas subject to the continuing jurisdiction of a United States district court, such action shall be taken within the framework of such court jurisdiction. Otherwise, regulations may be promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to section 3636(a) of this title which shall supersede any State or treaty Indian tribal law, regulation or order determined by the Secretary to place the United States in jeopardy of not fulfilling its international obligations under the Treaty. Timely notice of all such determinations shall be disseminated by electronic media and shall be published in local newspapers in the major fishing ports affected and in the Federal Register.
