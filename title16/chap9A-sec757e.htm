<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">Although the intent of Congress to amend this section is clear from the directory language of Pub. L. <!-- PDFPage:1210 -->98&ndash;146 which states that the sentence relating to the eligibility of the State of Idaho be added to &ldquo;16 U.S.C. 757e&rdquo;, that directory language has been editorially interpreted as directing the addition of that sentence to section 5 of Pub. L. 89&ndash;304, because Title 16 of the United States Code [this title] has never been enacted into positive law and its sections are therefore not susceptible of amendment as sections of &ldquo;16 U.S.C.&mdash;&rdquo; and because section 5 of Pub. L. 89&ndash;304 is the statute which was classified to, and serves as the source for 16 U.S.C. 757e [this section].</p>
