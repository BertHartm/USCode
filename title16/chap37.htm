<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Conserving or developing natural and cultural resources and enhancing and maintaining environmentally important lands and waters through the use of the Nation's young men and women in a Public Lands Corps can benefit those men and women by providing them with education and work opportunities, furthering their understanding and appreciation of the natural and cultural resources, and providing a means to pay for higher education or to repay indebtedness they have incurred to obtain higher education while at the same time benefiting the Nation's economy and its environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Many facilities and natural resources located on eligible service lands are in disrepair <!-- PDFPage:1761 -->or degraded and in need of labor intensive rehabilitation, restoration, and enhancement work which cannot be carried out by Federal agencies at existing personnel levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Youth conservation corps have established a good record of restoring and maintaining these kinds of facilities and resources in a cost effective and efficient manner, especially when they have worked in partnership arrangements with government land management agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) perform, in a cost-effective manner, appropriate conservation projects on eligible service lands where such projects will not be performed by existing employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) assist governments and Indian tribes in performing research and public education tasks associated with natural and cultural resources on eligible service lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) expose young men and women to public service while furthering their understanding and appreciation of the Nation's natural and cultural resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) expand educational opportunities by rewarding individuals who participate in national service with an increased ability to pursue higher education or job training; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) stimulate interest among the Nation's young men and women in conservation careers by exposing them to conservation professionals in land managing agencies.</p>
