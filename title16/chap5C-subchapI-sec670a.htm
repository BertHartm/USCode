<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary of Defense</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Program</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of Defense shall carry out a program to provide for the conservation and rehabilitation of natural resources on military installations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Integrated natural resources management plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To facilitate the program, the Secretary of each military department shall prepare and implement an integrated natural resources management plan for each military installation in the United States under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines that the absence of significant natural resources on a particular installation makes preparation of such a plan inappropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cooperative preparation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of a military department shall prepare each integrated natural resources management plan for which the Secretary is responsible in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the head of each appropriate State fish and wildlife agency for the State in which the military installation concerned is located. Consistent with paragraph (4), the resulting plan for the military installation shall reflect the mutual agreement of the parties concerning conservation, protection, and management of fish and wildlife resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Purposes of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consistent with the use of military installations to ensure the preparedness of the Armed Forces, the Secretaries of the military departments shall carry out the program required by this subsection to provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the conservation and rehabilitation of natural resources on military installations;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect on other law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subchapter&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except as specifically provided in the other provisions of this section and in section 670b of this title, authorizes the Secretary of a military department to require a Federal license or permit to hunt, fish, or trap on a military installation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required elements of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consistent with the use of military installations to ensure the preparedness of the Armed Forces, each integrated natural resources management plan prepared under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall, to the extent appropriate and applicable, provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) fish and wildlife management, land management, forest management, and fish- and wildlife-oriented recreation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) public access to the military installation that is necessary or appropriate for the use described in subparagraph (F), subject to requirements necessary to ensure safety and military security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) enforcement of applicable natural resource laws (including regulations);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) no net loss in the capability of military installation lands to support the military mission of the installation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) such other activities as the Secretary of the military department determines appropriate;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) must be reviewed as to operation and effect by the parties thereto on a regular basis, but not less often than every 5 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may stipulate the issuance of special State hunting and fishing permits to individuals and require payment of nominal fees therefor, which fees shall be utilized for the protection, conservation, and management of fish and wildlife, including habitat improvement and related activities in accordance with the integrated natural resources management plan; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Commanding Officer of the installation or persons designated by that Officer are authorized to enforce such special hunting and fishing permits and to collect, spend, administer, and account for fees for the permits, acting as agent or agents for the State if the integrated natural resources management plan so provides, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the fees collected under this paragraph may not be expended with respect to other than the military installation on which collected, unless the military installation is subsequently closed, in which case the fees may be transferred to another military installation to be used for the same purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibitions on sale and lease of lands unless effects compatible with plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) priority shall be given to the entering into of contracts for the procurement of such implementation and enforcement services with Federal and State agencies having responsibility for the conservation or management of fish or wildlife.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Applicability of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Integrated natural resources management plans agreed to under the authority of this section and section 670b of this title shall not be deemed to be, nor treated as, cooperative agreements to which chapter 63 of title 31 applies.</p>
