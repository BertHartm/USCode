Grazing shall be at no more than the current level, and subject to applicable laws and National Park Service regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as extending grazing privileges for any <!-- PDFPage:380 -->party or their assignee in any area of the park where, prior to October 21, 1999, such use was scheduled to expire according to the terms of a settlement by the United States Claims Court affecting property incorporated into the boundary of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the Secretary from accepting the voluntary termination of leases or permits for grazing within the park.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If land within the Park on which the grazing of livestock is authorized under permits or leases under subparagraph (A) is exchanged for private land under section 410fff&ndash;3(a) of this title, the Secretary shall transfer any grazing privileges to the land acquired in the exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within areas of the park designated as wilderness, the grazing of livestock, where authorized under permits in existence as of October 21, 1999, shall be permitted to continue subject to such reasonable regulations, policies, and practices as the Secretary deems necessary, consistent with this subchapter, the Wilderness Act [16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.], and other applicable laws and National Park Service regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to the grazing permits and leases referenced in this subsection, the Secretary shall allow grazing to continue, subject to periodic renewal&mdash;</p>
