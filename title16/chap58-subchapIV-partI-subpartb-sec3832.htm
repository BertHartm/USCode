<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary shall not terminate the contract for failure to establish approved vegetative or water cover on the land if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the failure to plant the cover was due to excessive rainfall or flooding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the land subject to the contract that could practicably be planted to the cover is planted to the cover; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the land on which the owner or operator was unable to plant the cover is planted to the cover after the wet conditions that prevented the planting subsides;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refund to the Secretary, or accept adjustments to, the rental payments and cost sharing payments provided to the owner or operator, as the Secretary considers appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the violation does not warrant termination of the contract;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">unless the transferee of the land agrees with the Secretary to assume all obligations of the contract, except that no refund of rental payments and cost sharing payments shall be required if the land is purchased by or for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or the transferee and the Secretary agree to modifications to the contract, in a case in which the modifications are consistent with the objectives of the program, as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) not to conduct any harvesting or grazing, nor otherwise make commercial use of the forage, on land that is subject to the contract, nor adopt any similar practice specified in the contract by the Secretary as a practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract, except that the Secretary may permit, consistent with the conservation of soil, water quality, and wildlife habitat (including habitat during nesting seasons for birds in the area)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) climate, soil type, and natural resources;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the installation of wind turbines, except that in permitting the installation of wind turbines, the Secretary shall determine the number and location of wind turbines that may be installed, taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the location, size, and other physical characteristics of the land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the extent to which the land contains wildlife and wildlife habitat; and</p>
