<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Designation of national interest electric transmission corridors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005, and every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary of Energy (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;), in consultation with affected States, shall conduct a study of electric transmission congestion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After considering alternatives and recommendations from interested parties (including an opportunity for comment from affected States), the Secretary shall issue a report, based on the study, which may designate any geographic area experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers as a national interest electric transmission corridor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall conduct the study and issue the report in consultation with any appropriate regional entity referred to in section 824<em>o</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In determining whether to designate a national interest electric transmission corridor under paragraph (2), the Secretary may consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the economic vitality and development of the corridor, or the end markets served by the corridor, may be constrained by lack of adequate or reasonably priced electricity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) economic growth in the corridor, or the end markets served by the corridor, may be jeopardized by reliance on limited sources of energy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a diversification of supply is warranted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the energy independence of the United States would be served by the designation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the designation would be in the interest of national energy policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the designation would enhance national defense and homeland security.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction permit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, the Commission may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue one or more permits for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section if the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) a State in which the transmission facilities are to be constructed or modified does not have authority to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) approve the siting of the facilities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) consider the interstate benefits expected to be achieved by the proposed construction or modification of transmission facilities in the State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the applicant for a permit is a transmitting utility under this chapter but does not qualify to apply for a permit or siting approval for the proposed project in a State because the applicant does not serve end-use customers in the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a State commission or other entity that has authority to approve the siting of the facilities has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) withheld approval for more than 1 year after the filing of an application seeking approval pursuant to applicable law or 1 year after the designation of the relevant national interest electric transmission corridor, whichever is later; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) conditioned its approval in such a manner that the proposed construction or modification will not significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce or is not economically feasible;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the facilities to be authorized by the permit will be used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the proposed construction or modification is consistent with the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the proposed construction or modification will significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce and protects or benefits consumers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the proposed construction or modification is consistent with sound national energy policy and will enhance energy independence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the proposed modification will maximize, to the extent reasonable and economical, the transmission capabilities of existing towers or structures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Permit applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Permit applications under subsection (b) of this section shall be made in writing to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall issue rules specifying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the form of the application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the information to be contained in the application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the manner of service of notice of the permit application on interested persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Comments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding before the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall afford each State in which a transmission facility covered by the permit is or will be located, each affected Federal agency and Indian tribe, private property owners, and other interested persons, a reasonable opportunity to present their views and recommendations with respect to the need for and impact of a facility covered by the permit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rights-of-way</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of a permit under subsection (b) of this section for electric transmission facilities to be located on property other than property owned by the United States or a State, if the permit holder cannot acquire by contract, or is unable to agree with the owner of the property to the compensation to be paid for, the necessary right-of-way to construct or modify the transmission facilities, the permit holder may acquire the right-of-way by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the district court of the United States for the district in which the property concerned is located, or in the appropriate court of the State in which the property is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any right-of-way acquired under paragraph (1) shall be used exclusively for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities within a reasonable period of time after the acquisition.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1309 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The practice and procedure in any action or proceeding under this subsection in the district court of the United States shall conform as nearly as practicable to the practice and procedure in a similar action or proceeding in the courts of the State in which the property is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the use of eminent domain to acquire a right-of-way for any purpose other than the construction, modification, operation, or maintenance of electric transmission facilities and related facilities. The right-of-way cannot be used for any other purpose, and the right-of-way shall terminate upon the termination of the use for which the right-of-way was acquired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any right-of-way acquired pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be considered a taking of private property for which just compensation is due.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Just compensation shall be an amount equal to the fair market value (including applicable severance damages) of the property taken on the date of the exercise of eminent domain authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) State law</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary and the heads of other agencies shall streamline the review and permitting of transmission within corridors designated under section 503 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act&nbsp;<sup><a href="#824p_1_target" name="824p_1">1</a></sup> (43 U.S.C. 1763) by fully taking into account prior analyses and decisions relating to the corridors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The document shall include consideration by the relevant agencies of any applicable criteria or other matters as required under applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) If any agency has denied a Federal authorization required for a transmission facility, or has failed to act by the deadline established by the Secretary pursuant to this section for deciding whether to issue the authorization, the applicant or any State in which the facility would be located may file an appeal with the President, who shall, in consultation with the affected agency, review the denial or failure to take action on the pending application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Based on the overall record and in consultation with the affected agency, the President may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) issue the necessary authorization with any appropriate conditions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) deny the application.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The President shall issue a decision not later than 90 days after the date of the filing of the appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In making a decision under this paragraph, the President shall comply with applicable requirements of Federal law, including any requirements of&mdash;</p>
