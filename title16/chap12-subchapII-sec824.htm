<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal regulation of transmission and sale of electric energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared that the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest, and that Federal regulation of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter and of that part of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is necessary in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use or sale of electric energy in interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, but except as provided in paragraph (2) shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy or deprive a State or State commission of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line. The Commission shall have jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy, but shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter, over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce, or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy consumed wholly by the transmitter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of sections 824i, 824j, and 824k of this title shall apply to the entities described in such provisions, and such entities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for purposes of carrying out such provisions and for purposes of applying the enforcement authorities of this chapter with respect to such provisions. Compliance with any order of the Commission under the provisions of section 824i or 824j of this title, shall not make an electric utility or other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for any purposes other than the purposes specified in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Electric energy in interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this subchapter, electric energy shall be held to be transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a State and consumed at any point outside thereof; but only insofar as such transmission takes place within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Sale of electric energy at wholesale&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;sale of electric energy at wholesale&rdquo; when used in this subchapter, means a sale of electric energy to any person for resale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Public utility&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; when used in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter <!-- PDFPage:1285 -->means any person who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter (other than facilities subject to such jurisdiction solely by reason of section 824i, 824j, or 824k of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) United States, State, political subdivision of a State, or agency or instrumentality thereof exempt</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision in this subchapter shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a State, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, or employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific reference thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Books and records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon written order of a State commission, a State commission may examine the books, accounts, memoranda, contracts, and records of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an electric utility company subject to its regulatory authority under State law,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any exempt wholesale generator selling energy at wholesale to such electric utility, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any electric utility company, or holding company thereof, which is an associate company or affiliate of an exempt wholesale generator which sells electric energy to an electric utility company referred to in subparagraph (A),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">wherever located, if such examination is required for the effective discharge of the State commission's regulatory responsibilities affecting the provision of electric service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Where a State commission issues an order pursuant to paragraph (1), the State commission shall not publicly disclose trade secrets or sensitive commercial information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any United States district court located in the State in which the State commission referred to in paragraph (1) is located shall have jurisdiction to enforce compliance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) preempt applicable State law concerning the provision of records and other information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any way limit rights to obtain records and other information under Federal law, contracts, or otherwise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection the terms &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo;, &ldquo;associate company&rdquo;, &ldquo;electric utility company&rdquo;, &ldquo;holding company&rdquo;, &ldquo;subsidiary company&rdquo;, and &ldquo;exempt wholesale generator&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as when used in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 [15 U.S.C. 79 et seq.].</p>
