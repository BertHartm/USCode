<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reports and recommendations; consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In furtherance of such purposes, the reports and recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior on the wildlife aspects of such projects, and any report of the head of the State agency exercising administration over the wildlife resources of the State, based on surveys and investigations conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and such State agency for the purpose of determining the possible damage to wildlife resources and for the purpose of determining means and measures that should be adopted to prevent the loss of or damage to such wildlife resources, as well as to provide concurrently for the development and improvement of such resources, shall be made an integral part of any report prepared or submitted by any agency of the Federal Government responsible for engineering surveys and construction of such projects when such reports are presented to the Congress or to any agency or person having the authority or the power, by administrative action or otherwise, (1) to authorize the construction of water-resource development projects or (2) to approve a report on the modification or supplementation of plans for previously authorized projects, to which sections 661 to 666c of this title apply. Recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior shall be as specific as is practicable with respect to features recommended for wildlife conservation and development, lands to be utilized or acquired for such purposes, the results expected, and shall describe the damage to wildlife attributable to the project and the measures proposed for mitigating or compensating for these damages. The reporting officers in project reports of the Federal agencies shall give full consideration to the report and recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior and to any report of the State agency on the wildlife aspects of such projects, and the project plan shall include such justifiable means and measures for wildlife purposes as the reporting agency finds should be adopted to obtain maximum overall project benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Modification of projects; acquisition of lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Federal agencies authorized to construct or operate water-control projects are authorized to modify or add to the structures and operations of such projects, the construction of which has not been substantially completed on the date of enactment of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, and to acquire lands in accordance with section 663 of this title, in order to accommodate the means and measures for such conservation of wildlife resources as an integral part of such projects: <em>Provided</em>, That for projects au<!-- PDFPage:1067 -->thorized by a specific Act of Congress before the date of enactment of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (1) such modification or land acquisition shall be compatible with the purposes for which the project was authorized; (2) the cost of such modifications or land acquisition, as means and measures to prevent loss of and damage to wildlife resources to the extent justifiable, shall be an integral part of the cost of such projects; and (3) the cost of such modifications or land acquisition for the development or improvement of wildlife resources may be included to the extent justifiable, and an appropriate share of the cost of any project may be allocated for this purpose with a finding as to the part of such allocated cost, if any, to be reimbursed by non-Federal interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Project costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The cost of planning for and the construction or installation and maintenance of such means and measures adopted to carry out the conservation purposes of this section shall constitute an integral part of the cost of such projects: <em>Provided</em>, That such cost attributable to the development and improvement of wildlife shall not extend beyond that necessary for (1) land acquisition, (2) facilities as specifically recommended in water resource project reports, (3) modification of the project, and (4) modification of project operations, but shall not include the operation of wildlife facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfer of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of construction by a Federal agency, that agency is authorized to transfer to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, out of appropriations or other funds made available for investigations, engineering, or construction, such funds as may be necessary to conduct all or part of the investigations required to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Estimation of wildlife benefits or losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to other requirements, there shall be included in any report submitted to Congress supporting a recommendation for authorization of any new project for the control or use of water as described herein (including any new division of such project or new supplemental works on such project) an estimation of the wildlife benefits or losses to be derived therefrom including benefits to be derived from measures recommended specifically for the development and improvement of wildlife resources, the cost of providing wildlife benefits (including the cost of additional facilities to be installed or lands to be acquired specifically for that particular phase of wildlife conservation relating to the development and improvement of wildlife), the part of the cost of joint-use facilities allocated to wildlife, and the part of such costs, if any, to be reimbursed by non-Federal interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applicability to projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall be applicable with respect to any project for the control or use of water as prescribed herein, or any unit of such project authorized before or after the date of enactment of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act for planning or construction, but shall not be applicable to any project or unit thereof authorized before the date of enactment of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act if the construction of the particular project or unit thereof has been substantially completed. A project or unit thereof shall be considered to be substantially completed when sixty percent or more of the estimated construction cost has been obligated for expenditure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Exempt projects and activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of section 661 to 666c of this title shall not be applicable to those projects for the impoundment of water where the maximum surface area of such impoundments is less than ten acres, nor to activities for or in connection with programs primarily for land management and use carried out by Federal agencies with respect to Federal lands under their jurisdiction.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of acquired properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Properties acquired for the purposes of this section shall continue to be used for such purposes, and shall not become the subject of exchange or other transactions if such exchange or other transaction would defeat the initial purpose of their acquisition.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Policy Concerning Distribution of Eagle Feathers for Native American Religious Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 29, 1994, 59 F.R. 22953, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Eagle feathers hold a sacred place in Native American culture and religious practices. Because of the feathers&rsquo; significance to Native American heritage and consistent with due respect for the government-to-government relationship between the Federal and Native American tribal governments, this Administration has undertaken policy and procedural changes to facilitate the collection and distribution of scarce eagle bodies and parts for this purpose. This memorandum affirms and formalizes executive branch policy to ensure that progress begun on this important matter continues across the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, as part of an historic meeting with all federally recognized tribal governments, I am directing executive departments and agencies (hereafter collectively &ldquo;agency&rdquo; or &ldquo;agencies&rdquo;) to work cooperatively with tribal governments and to reexamine broadly their practices and procedures to seek opportunities to accommodate Native American religious practices to the fullest extent under the law.</p>
<p class="note-body">As part of these efforts, agencies shall take steps to improve their collection and transfer of eagle carcasses and eagle body parts (&ldquo;eagles&rdquo;) for Native American religious purposes. The success of this initiative requires the participation, and is therefore the responsibility, of all Federal land managing agencies, not just those within the Department of the Interior. I therefore direct each agency responsible for managing Federal lands to diligently and expeditiously recover salvageable eagles found on lands under their jurisdiction and ensure that the eagles are promptly shipped to the National Eagle Repository (&ldquo;Repository&rdquo;). To assist agencies in this expanded effort, the Secretary of the Interior shall issue guidelines to all relevant agencies for the proper shipment of eagles to the Repository. After receiving these guidelines, agencies shall immediately adopt policies, practices, and procedures necessary in accordance with these guidelines to recover and transfer eagles to the Repository promptly.</p>
<p class="note-body">I support and encourage the initial steps taken by the Department of the Interior to improve the distribution of eagles for Native American religious purposes. In particular, the Department of the Interior shall continue to adopt policies and procedures and take those actions necessary to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) ensure the priority of distribution of eagles, upon permit application, first for traditional Native American religious purposes, to the extent permitted by law, and then to other uses;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) simplify the eagle permit application process quickly and to the greatest extent possible to help achieve the objectives of this memorandum;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) minimize the delay and ensure respect and dignity in the process of distributing eagles for Native American religious purposes to the greatest extent possible;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) expand efforts to involve Native American tribes, organizations, and individuals in the distribution process, both at the Repository and on tribal lands, consistent with applicable laws;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) review means to ensure that adequate refrigerated storage space is available to process the eagles; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) continue efforts to improve the Repository's ability to facilitate the objectives of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of the Interior shall be responsible for coordinating any interagency efforts to address continuing executive branch actions necessary to achieve the objectives of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">We must continue to be committed to greater intergovernmental communication and cooperation. In addition to working more closely with tribal governments, we must enlist the assistance of, and cooperate with, State and local governments to achieve the objectives of this memorandum. I therefore request that the Department of the Interior work with State fish and game agencies and other relevant State and local authorities to facilitate the objectives of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">With commitment and cooperation by all of the agencies in the executive branch and with tribal governments, I am confident that we will be able to accomplish meaningful progress in the distribution of eagles for Native American religious purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

With respect to refuge lands in the State of Alaska, those programs relating to the management of resources for which any other agency of the Federal Government exercises administrative responsibility through cooperative agreement shall remain in effect, subject to the direct supervision of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, as long as such agency agrees to exercise such responsibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The mission of the System is to administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management, and where appropriate, restoration of the fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats within the United States for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to the System, it is the policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each refuge shall be managed to fulfill the mission of the System, as well as the specific purposes for which that refuge was established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) compatible wildlife-dependent recreation is a legitimate and appropriate general public use of the System, directly related to the mission of the System and the purposes of many refuges, and which generally fosters refuge management and through which the American public can develop an appreciation for fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) compatible wildlife-dependent recreational uses are the priority general public uses of the System and shall receive priority consideration in refuge planning and management; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) when the Secretary determines that a proposed wildlife-dependent recreational use is a compatible use within a refuge, that activity should be facilitated, subject to such restrictions or regulations as may be necessary, reasonable, and appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) plan and direct the continued growth of the System in a manner that is best designed to accomplish the mission of the System, to contribute to the conservation of the ecosystems of the United States, to complement efforts of States and other Federal agencies to conserve fish and wildlife and their habitats, and to increase support for the System and participation from conservation partners and the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) ensure that the mission of the System described in paragraph (2) and the purposes of each refuge are carried out, except that if a conflict exists between the purposes of a refuge and the mission of the System, the conflict shall be resolved in a manner that first protects the purposes of the refuge, and, to the extent practicable, that also achieves the mission of the System;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) ensure effective coordination, interaction, and cooperation with owners of land adjoining refuges and the fish and wildlife agency of the States in which the units of the System are located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) assist in the maintenance of adequate water quantity and water quality to fulfill the mission of the System and the purposes of each refuge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) acquire, under State law, water rights that are needed for refuge purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) recognize compatible wildlife-dependent recreational uses as the priority general public uses of the System through which the American public can develop an appreciation for fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) ensure that opportunities are provided within the System for compatible wildlife-dependent recreational uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) ensure that priority general public uses of the System receive enhanced consideration over other general public uses in planning and management within the System;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) provide increased opportunities for families to experience compatible wildlife-dependent recreation, particularly opportunities for parents and their children to safely engage in traditional outdoor activities, such as fishing and hunting;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(L) continue, consistent with existing laws and interagency agreements, authorized or permitted uses of units of the System by other Federal agencies, including those necessary to facilitate military preparedness;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) President Theodore Roosevelt began the National Wildlife Refuge System by establishing the first refuge at Pelican Island, Florida, on March 14, 1903;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the National Wildlife Refuge System is comprised of more than 93,000,000 acres of Federal land managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in more than 532 individual refuges and thousands of waterfowl production areas located in all 50 States and the territories of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the System is the only network of Federal land dedicated singularly to wildlife conservation and where wildlife-dependent recreation and environmental education are priority public uses;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the System serves a vital role in the conservation of millions of migratory birds, dozens of endangered species and threatened species, some of the premier fisheries of the United States, marine mammals, and the habitats on which such species of fish and wildlife depend;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) each year the System provides millions of Americans with opportunities to participate in wildlife-dependent recreation, including hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6)(A) public visitation to national wildlife refuges is growing, with more than 35,000,000 visitors annually; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) it is essential that visitor centers and public use facilities be properly constructed, operated, and maintained;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and Community Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998 (16 U.S.C. 742f note; Public Law 105&ndash;242) [see Short Title of 1998 Amendments note under section 742a of this title], and the amendments made by that Act, significantly enhance the ability of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to incorporate volunteers and partnerships in refuge management;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) as of the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 1, 2000], the System has an unacceptable backlog of critical operation and maintenance needs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the occasion of the centennial of the System, in 2003, presents a historic opportunity to enhance natural resource stewardship and expand public enjoyment of the national wildlife refuges of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the budget submission of the Department of the Interior to the President; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the President's budget request to Congress; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12996. Management and General Public Use of National Wildlife Refuge System</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12996, Mar. 25, 1996, 61 F.R. 13647, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in furtherance of the purposes of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a [et seq.]), the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 [et seq.]), the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd [, 668ee]), the Refuge Recreation Act (16 U.S.C. 460k [et seq.]), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 [et seq.]), the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3901 [et seq.]), the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 4401 [et seq.]), the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 [et seq.]), and other pertinent statutes, and in order to conserve fish and wildlife and their habitat, it is ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>The Mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System</em>. The mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System (&ldquo;Refuge System&rdquo;) is to preserve a national network of lands and waters for the conservation and <!-- PDFPage:1087 -->management of fish, wildlife, and plant resources of the United States for the benefit of present and future generations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Guiding Principles</em>. To help ensure a bright future for its treasured national heritage, I hereby affirm the following four guiding principles for the management and general public use of the Refuge System:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Public Use</em>. The Refuge System provides important opportunities for compatible wildlife-dependent recreational activities involving hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and environmental education and interpretation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Habitat</em>. Fish and wildlife will not prosper without high-quality habitat, and without fish and wildlife, traditional uses of refuges cannot be sustained. The Refuge System will continue to conserve and enhance the quality and diversity of fish and wildlife habitat within refuges.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Partnerships</em>. America's sportsmen and women were the first partners who insisted on protecting valuable wildlife habitat within wildlife refuges. Conservation partnerships with other Federal agencies, State agencies, Tribes, organizations, industry, and the general public can make significant contributions to the growth and management of the Refuge System.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Public Involvement</em>. The public should be given a full and open opportunity to participate in decisions regarding acquisition and management of our National Wildlife Refuges.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Directives to the Secretary of the Interior</em>. To the extent consistent with existing laws and interagency agreements, the Secretary of the Interior, in carrying out his trustee and stewardship responsibilities for the Refuge System, is directed to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) recognize compatible wildlife-dependent recreational activities involving hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and environmental education and interpretation as priority general public uses of the Refuge System through which the American public can develop an appreciation for fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) provide expanded opportunities for these priority public uses within the Refuge System when they are compatible and consistent with sound principles of fish and wildlife management, and are otherwise in the public interest;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) ensure that such priority public uses receive enhanced attention in planning and management within the Refuge System;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) provide increased opportunities for families to experience wildlife-dependent recreation, particularly opportunities for parents and their children to safely engage in traditional outdoor activities, such as fishing and hunting;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) ensure that the biological integrity and environmental health of the Refuge System is maintained for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans;</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) continue, consistent with existing laws and interagency agreements, authorized or permitted uses of units of the Refuge System by other Federal agencies, including those necessary to facilitate military preparedness;</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) plan and direct the continued growth of the Refuge System in a manner that is best designed to accomplish the mission of the Refuge System, to contribute to the conservation of the ecosystems of the United States, and to increase support for the Refuge System and participation from conservation partners and the public;</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) ensure timely and effective cooperation and collaboration with Federal agencies and State fish and wildlife agencies during the course of acquiring and managing National Wildlife Refuges;</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) ensure appropriate public involvement opportunities will be provided in conjunction with refuge planning and management activities; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(j) identify, prior to acquisition, existing compatible wildlife-dependent uses of new refuge lands that shall be permitted to continue on an interim basis pending completion of comprehensive planning.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
