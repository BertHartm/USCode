<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Admission fees at designated areas; &ldquo;Golden Eagle Passport&rdquo; annual admission permit; single-visit fees; fee-free travel areas; &ldquo;Golden Age Passport&rdquo; annual entrance permit; lifetime admission permit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Entrance or admission fees shall be charged only at designated units of the National Park System or National Conservation Areas administered by the Department of the Interior and National Recreation Areas, National Monuments, National Volcanic Monuments, National Scenic Areas, and no more than 21 areas of concentrated public use administered by the Department of Agriculture. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;area of concentrated public use&rdquo; means an area that is managed primarily for outdoor recreation purposes, contains at least one major recreation attraction, where facilities and services necessary to accommodate heavy public use are provided, and public access to the area is provided in such a manner that admission fees can be efficiently collected at one or more centralized locations. No admission fees of any kind shall be charged or imposed for entrance into any other federally owned areas which are operated and maintained by a Federal agency and used for outdoor recreation purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) For admission into any such designated area, an annual admission permit (to be known as the Golden Eagle Passport) shall be available, for a fee of not more than $25. The permittee and any person accompanying him in a single, private, noncommercial vehicle, or alternatively, the permittee and his spouse, children, and parents accompanying him where entry to the area is by any means other than private, noncommercial vehicle, shall be entitled to general admission into any area designated pursuant to this subsection. The annual permit shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date the annual fee is paid. The annual permit shall not authorize any uses for which additional fees are charged pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The annual permit shall be nontransferable and the unlawful use thereof shall be punishable in accordance with regulations established pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. The annual permit shall be available for purchase at any such designated area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture may authorize businesses, nonprofit entities, and other organizations to sell and collect fees for the Golden Eagle Passport subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretaries may jointly prescribe. The Secretaries shall develop detailed guidelines for promotional advertising of non-Federal Golden Eagle Passport sales and shall monitor compliance with such guidelines. The Secretaries may authorize the sellers to withhold amounts up to, but not exceeding 8 percent of the gross fees collected from the sale of such passports as reimbursement for actual expenses of the sales. Receipts from such non-Federal sales of the Golden Eagle Passport shall be deposited into the special account established in subsection (i) of this section, to be allocated between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture in the same ratio as receipts from admission into Federal fee areas administered by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For admission into a specific designated unit of the National Park System, or into several specific units located in a particular geographic area, the Secretary is authorized to make available an annual admission permit for a reasonable fee. The fee shall not exceed $15 regardless of how many units of the park system are covered. The permit shall convey the privileges of, and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as, the Golden Eagle Passport, except that it shall be valid only for admission into the specific unit or units of the National Park System indicated at the time of purchase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Reasonable admission fees for a single visit at any designated area shall be established by the administering Secretary for persons who choose not to purchase the annual permit. A &ldquo;single visit&rdquo; means a more or less continuous stay within a designated area. Payment of a single visit admission fee shall authorize exits from and reentries to a single designated area for a period of from one to fifteen days, such period to be defined for each designated area by the administering Secretary based upon a determination of the period of time reasonably and ordinarily necessary for such a single visit. The fee for a single-visit permit at any designated area applicable to those persons entering by private, noncommercial vehicle shall be no more than $5 per vehicle. The single-visit permit shall admit the permittee and all persons accompanying him in a single vehicle. The fee for a single-visit permit at any designated area applicable to those <!-- PDFPage:499 -->persons entering by any means other than a private noncommercial vehicle shall be no more than $3 per person. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the maximum fee amounts set forth in this paragraph shall apply to all designated areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No admission fee shall be charged for travel by private, non-commercial vehicle over any national parkway or any road or highway established as a part of the National Federal Aid System, as defined in section 101 of title 23, which is commonly used by the public as a means of travel between two places either or both of which are outside the area. Nor shall any fee be charged for travel by private, noncommercial vehicle over any road or highway to any land in which such person has any property right if such land is within any such designated area. In the Smoky Mountains National Park, unless fees are charged for entrance into said park on main highways and thoroughfares, fees shall not be charged for entrance on other routes into said park or any part thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, no admission fee may be charged at any unit of the National Park System which provides significant outdoor recreation opportunities in an urban environment and to which access is publicly available at multiple locations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall establish procedures providing for the issuance of a lifetime admission permit (to be known as the &ldquo;Golden Age Passport&rdquo;) to any citizen of, or person domiciled in, the United States sixty-two years of age or older applying for such permit. Such permit shall be nontransferable, shall be issued for a one-time charge of $10, and shall entitle the permittee and any person accompanying him in a single, private, noncommercial vehicle, or alternatively, the permittee and his spouse and children accompanying him where entry to the area is by any means other than private, noncommercial vehicle, to general admission into any area designated pursuant to this subsection. No other free permits shall be issued to any person: <em>Provided</em>, That no fees of any kind shall be collected from any persons who have a right of access for hunting or fishing privileges under a specific provision of law or treaty or who are engaged in the conduct of official Federal, State, or local Government business and <em>Provided further</em>, That for no more than three years after the date of enactment of this Act, visitors to the United States will be granted entrance, without charge, to any designated admission fee area upon presentation of a valid passport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall establish procedures providing for the issuance of a lifetime admission permit to any citizen of, or person domiciled in, the United States, if such citizen or person applies for such permit, and is blind or permanently disabled. Such procedures shall assure that such permit shall be issued only to persons who have been medically determined to be blind or permanently disabled for purposes of receiving benefits under Federal law as a result of said blindness or permanent disability as determined by the Secretaries. Such permit shall be nontransferable, shall be issued without charge, and shall entitle the permittee and any person accompanying him in a single, private, noncommercial vehicle, or alternatively, the permittee and his spouse and children accompanying him where entry to the area is by any means other than private, noncommercial vehicle, to general admission into any area designated pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) No later than 60 days after December 22, 1987, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate a report on the entrance fees proposed to be charged at units of the National Park System. The report shall include a list of units of the National Park System and the entrance fee proposed to be charged at each unit. The Secretary of the Interior shall include in the report an explanation of the guidelines used in applying the criteria in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Following submittal of the report to the respective committees, any proposed changes to matters covered in the report, including the addition or deletion of park units or the increase or decrease of fee levels at park units shall not take effect until 60 days after notice of the proposed change has been submitted to the committees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) No admission fee may be charged at any unit of the National Park System for admission of any person 16 years of age or less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) No admission fee may be charged at any unit of the National Park System for admission of organized school groups or outings conducted for educational purposes by schools or other bona fide educational institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) No admission fee may be charged at the following units of the National Park System: U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, Independence National Historical Park, any unit of the National Park System within the District of Columbia, Arlington House&mdash;Robert E. Lee National Memorial, San Juan National Historic Site, and Canaveral National Seashore.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) For each unit of the National Park System where an admission fee is collected, the Director shall annually designate at least one day during periods of high visitation as a &ldquo;Fee-Free Day&rdquo; when no admission fee shall be charged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) In the case of the following parks, the fee for a single-visit permit applicable to those persons entering by private, noncommercial vehicle (the permittee and all persons accompanying him in a single vehicle) shall be no more than $10 per vehicle and the fee for a single-visit permit applicable to persons entering by any means other than a private noncommercial vehicle shall be no more than $5 per person: Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park and after the end of fiscal year 1990, Grand Canyon National Park. In the case of Yellowstone and Grand Teton, a single-visit fee collected at one unit shall also admit the vehicle or person who paid such fee for a single-visit to the other unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(12) Notwithstanding section 410hh&ndash;2 of this title, the Secretary may charge an admission fee under this section at Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:500 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recreation use fees; collection; campgrounds at lakes or reservoirs under jurisdiction of Corps of Engineers; fees for Golden Age Passport permittees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal agency developing, administering, providing or furnishing at Federal expense, specialized outdoor recreation sites, facilities, equipment, or services shall, in accordance with this subsection and subsection (d) of this section, provide for the collection of daily recreation use fees at the place of use or any reasonably convenient location: <em>Provided</em>, That in no event shall there be a charge by any such agency for the use, either singly or in any combination, of drinking water, wayside exhibits, roads, overlook sites, visitors&rsquo; centers, scenic drives, or toilet facilities, nor shall there be any such charge solely for the use of picnic tables: <em>Provided</em>, That in no event shall there be a charge for the use of any campground not having a majority of the following: tent or trailer spaces, picnic tables, drinking water, access road, refuse containers, toilet facilities, personal collection of the fee by an employee or agent of the Federal agency operating the facility, reasonable visitor protection, and simple devices for containing a campfire (where campfires are permitted). For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;specialized outdoor recreation sites&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to, campgrounds, swimming sites, boat launch facilities, and managed parking lots. Any Golden Age Passport permittee, or permittee under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section, shall be entitled upon presentation of such permit to utilize such special recreation facilities at a rate of 50 per centum of the established use fee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special recreation permits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Special recreation permits for uses such as group activities, recreation events, motorized recreation vehicles, and other specialized recreation uses may be issued in accordance with procedures and at fees established by the agency involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Criteria, posting and uniformity of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All fees established pursuant to this section shall be fair and equitable, taking into consideration the direct and indirect cost to the Government, the benefits to the recipient, the public policy or interest served, the comparable recreation fees charged by non-Federal public agencies, the economic and administrative feasibility of fee collection and other pertinent factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Clear notice that a fee has been established pursuant to this section shall be prominently posted at each area and at appropriate locations therein and shall be included in publications distributed at such areas. It is the intent of this part that comparable fees should be charged by the several Federal agencies for comparable services and facilities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Federal and State laws unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this part shall authorize Federal hunting or fishing licenses or fees or charges for commercial or other activities not related to recreation, nor shall it affect any rights or authority of the States with respect to fish and wildlife, nor shall it repeal or modify any provision of law that permits States or political subdivisions to share in the revenues from Federal lands or any provision of law that provides that any fees or charges collected at particular Federal areas shall be used for or credited to specific purposes or special funds as authorized by that provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Repealed. Pub. L. 104&ndash;66, title I, &sect;1081(f), Dec. 21, 1995, 109 Stat. 721</h4>

Fees collected by the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to this subsection shall continue to be available for the purposes of distribution to States and counties in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in any fiscal year, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior may withhold from the special account established under subparagraph (A) such portion of all receipts collected from fees imposed under this section in such fiscal year as the Secretary of Agriculture or the Sec<!-- PDFPage:501 -->retary of the Interior, as appropriate, determines to be equal to the fee collection costs for that fiscal year: <em>Provided</em>, That such costs shall not exceed 15 percent of all receipts collected from fees imposed under this section in that fiscal year. The amounts so withheld shall be retained by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior, as appropriate, and shall be available, without further appropriation, for expenditure by the Secretary concerned to cover fee collection costs in that fiscal year. The Secretary concerned shall deposit into the special account established pursuant to subparagraph (A) any amounts so retained which remain unexpended and unobligated at the end of the fiscal year. For the purposes of this subparagraph, for any fiscal year, the term &ldquo;fee collection costs&rdquo; means those costs for personnel and infrastructure directly associated with the collection of fees imposed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts covered into the special account for each agency during each fiscal year shall, after the end of such fiscal year, be available for appropriation solely for the purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection. No funds shall be transferred from fee receipts made available under this part to each unit of the national park system:&nbsp;<sup><a href="#460l-6a_1_target" name="460l-6a_1">1</a></sup> <em>Provided, however</em>, That in making appropriations, funds derived from such fees may be used for any purpose authorized therein.

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Amounts allocated under this subsection to any unit for any fiscal year and not expended in that fiscal year shall remain available for expenditure at that unit until expended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Selling of permits and collection of fees by volunteers at designated areas; collecting agency duties; surety bonds; selling of annual admission permits by public and private entities under arrangements with collecting agency head</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When authorized by the head of the collecting agency, volunteers at designated areas may sell permits and collect fees authorized or established pursuant to this section. The head of such agency shall ensure that such volunteers have adequate training regarding&mdash;</p>

Such arrangements shall require each such entity to reimburse the United States for the full amount to be received from the sale of such permits at or before the agency delivers the permits to such entity for sale.</p>
