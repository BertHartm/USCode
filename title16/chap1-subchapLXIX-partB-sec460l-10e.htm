<p class="note-body">Section 1021(a) of Pub. L. 104&ndash;333, as amended by Pub. L. 106&ndash;176, title I, &sect;123(a), Mar. 10, 2000, 114 Stat. 29, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that the Federal Government, under the authority of the Reclamation Act [43 U.S.C. 371 et seq.] and other statutes, has developed man-made lakes and reservoirs that have become a powerful magnet for diverse recreational activities and that such activities contribute to the well-being of families and individuals and the economic viability of local communities.
