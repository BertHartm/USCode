<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Priority project list</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Preparation of list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within forty-five days after November 29, 1990, the Secretary shall convene the Task Force to initiate a process to identify and prepare a list of coastal wetlands restoration projects in Louisiana to provide for the long-term conservation of such wetlands and dependent fish and wildlife populations in order of priority, based on the cost-effectiveness of such projects in creating, restoring, protecting, or enhancing coastal wetlands, taking into account the quality of such coastal wetlands, with due allowance for small-scale projects necessary to demonstrate the use of new techniques or materials for coastal wetlands restoration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Task Force procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall convene meetings of the Task Force as appropriate to ensure that the list is produced and transmitted annually to the Congress as required by this subsection. If necessary to ensure transmittal of the list on a timely basis, the Task Force shall produce the list by a majority vote of those Task Force members who are present and voting; except that no coastal wetlands restoration project shall be placed on the list without the concurrence of the lead Task Force member that the project is cost effective and sound from an engineering perspective. Those projects which potentially impact navigation or flood control on the lower Mississippi River System shall be constructed consistent with section 3953 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Transmittal of list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No later than one year after November 29, 1990, the Secretary shall transmit to the Congress the list of priority coastal wetlands restoration projects required by paragraph (1) of this subsection. Thereafter, the list shall be updated annually by the Task Force members and transmitted by the Secretary to the Congress as part of the President's annual budget submission. Annual transmittals of the list to the Congress shall include a status report on each project and a statement from the Secretary of the Treasury indicating the amounts available for expenditure to carry out this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, with the funds made available in accordance with section 3955 of this title, allocate funds among the members of the Task Force based on the need for such funds and such other factors as the Task Force deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Federal and State project planning</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Plan preparation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Task Force shall prepare a plan to identify coastal wetlands restoration projects, in order of priority, based on the cost-effectiveness of such projects in creating, restoring, protecting, or enhancing the long-term conservation of coastal wetlands, taking into account the quality of such coastal wetlands, with due allowance for small-scale projects necessary to demonstrate the use of new techniques or materials for coastal wetlands restoration. Such restoration plan shall be completed within three years from November 29, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose of the plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of the restoration plan is to develop a comprehensive approach to restore and prevent the loss of, coastal wetlands in Louisiana. Such plan shall coordinate and integrate coastal wetlands restoration projects in a manner that will ensure the long-term conservation of the coastal wetlands of Louisiana.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Integration of existing plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In developing the restoration plan, the Task Force shall seek to integrate the &ldquo;Louisiana Comprehensive Coastal Wetlands Feasibility Study&rdquo; conducted by the Secretary of the Army and the &ldquo;Coastal Wetlands Conservation <!-- PDFPage:2147 -->and Restoration Plan&rdquo; prepared by the State of Louisiana's Wetlands Conservation and Restoration Task Force.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Elements of the plan</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Cost-sharing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts made available in accordance with section 3955 of this title to carry out coastal wetlands restoration projects under this chapter shall provide 75 percent of the cost of such projects.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Federal share upon conservation plan approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, if the State develops a Coastal Wetlands Conservation Plan pursuant to this chapter, and such conservation plan is approved pursuant to section 3953 of this title, amounts made available in accordance with section 3955 of this title for any coastal wetlands restoration project under this section shall be 85 percent of the cost of the project. In the event that the Secretary, the Director, and the Administrator jointly determine that the State is not taking reasonable steps to implement and administer a conservation plan developed and approved pursuant to this chapter, amounts made available in accordance with section 3955 of this title for any coastal wetlands restoration project shall revert to 75 percent of the cost of the project: <em>Provided, however</em>, that&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3952_1_target" name="3952_1">1</a></sup> such reversion to the lower cost share level shall not occur until the Governor has been <!-- PDFPage:2148 -->provided notice of, and opportunity for hearing on, any such determination by the Secretary, the Director, and Administrator, and the State has been given ninety days from such notice or hearing to take corrective action.</p>
