<p class="statutory-body">Approved conservation plans of eligible landowners and operators developed in cooperation with the soil and water conservation district or the State forester or other appropriate State official in which their lands are situated shall form a basis for contracts under this chapter.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) upon transfer of his right and interest in the farm, ranch, forest, wetland, or other land during the contract period to forfeit all rights to further payments or grants under the contract and refund to the United States all payments or grants received thereunder unless the transferee of any such land agrees with the Secretary to assume all obligations of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) not to adopt any practice specified by the Secretary in the contract as a practice which would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to comply with all applicable Federal, State, or local laws, and regulations, including those governing environmental protection and noxious weed abatement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to such additional provisions as the Secretary determines are desirable and includes in the contract to effectuate the purposes of the program or to facilitate the practical administration of the program: <em>Provided</em>, That all contracts entered into to effectuate the purposes of the Water Bank Act [16 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.] for wetlands shall contain the further agreement of the owner or operator that he shall not drain, burn, fill, or otherwise destroy the wetland character of such areas, nor use such areas for agricultural purposes: <em>And provided further</em>, That contracts entered into for the protection of wetlands to effectuate the purposes of the Water Bank Act may include wetlands covered by Federal or State government easement which permits agricultural use, together with such adjacent areas as determined desirable by the Secretary.</p>

The portion of such cost (including labor) to be shared shall be that part which the Secretary determines is necessary and appropriate to effectuate the physical installation of the conservation practices and measures under the contract, but, in the case of a contract not entered into under an ad<!-- PDFPage:1480 -->vertising and bid procedure under the provisions of section 1509(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1503_1_target" name="1503_1">1</a></sup> of this title, not less than 50 per centum or more than 75 per centum of the actual costs incurred by the owner or operator.</p>
