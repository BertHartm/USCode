<p class="statutory-body">Of the balance of each such annual appropriation remaining after making the distribution under subsection (a) of this section, an amount equal to $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1993, $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1994 and 1995, and $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1996, and 1997 shall be used as follows:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funds available for expenses of investigations and administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the balance of each such annual appropriation remaining after the distribution and use under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, respectively, so much, not to exceed 6 per centum of such balance, as the Secretary of the Interior may estimate to be necessary for his or her expenses in the conduct of necessary investigations, administration, and the execution of this chapter and for aiding in the formulation, adoption, or administration of any compact between two or more States for the conservation and management of migratory fishes in marine or freshwaters, shall be deducted for that purpose, and such sum is authorized to be made available until the expiration of the next succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Apportionment among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior, after the distribution, transfer, use, and deduction under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, respectively, shall apportion the remainder of each such annual appropriation among the several States in the following manner: 40 per centum in the ratio which the area of each State including coastal and Great Lakes waters (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) bears to the total area of all the States, and 60 per centum in the ratio which the number of persons holding paid licenses to fish for sport or recreation in the State in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which such apportionment is made, as certified to said Secretary by the State fish and game departments, bears to the number of such persons in all the States. Such apportionments shall be adjusted equitably so that no State shall receive less than 1 per centum nor more than 5 per centum of the total amount apportioned. Where the apportionment to any State under this section is less than $4,500 annually, the Secretary of the Interior may allocate not more than $4,500 of said appropriation to said State to carry out the purposes of this chapter when said State certifies to the Secretary of the Interior that it has set aside not less than $1,500 from its fish-and-game funds or has made, through its legislature, an appropriation in this amount of said purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Unallocated funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">So much of any sum not allocated under the provisions of this section for any fiscal year is hereby authorized to be made available for expenditure to carry out the purposes of this chapter until the close of the succeeding fiscal year, and if unexpended or unobligated at the end of such year, such sum is hereby authorized to be made available for expenditure by the Secretary of the Interior in carrying on the research program of the Fish and Wildlife Service in respect to fish of material value for sport or recreation. The term fiscal year as used in this section shall be a period of twelve consecutive months from October 1 through the succeeding September 30, except that the period for enumeration of persons holding licenses to fish shall be a State's fiscal or license year.</p>
