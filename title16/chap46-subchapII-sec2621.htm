<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Consideration and determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State regulatory authority (with respect to each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated electric utility shall consider each standard established by subsection (d) of this section and make a determination concerning whether or not it is appropriate to implement such standard to carry out the purposes of this chapter. For purposes of such consideration and determination in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and for purposes of any review of such consideration and determination in any court in accordance with section 2633 of this title, the purposes of this chapter supplement otherwise applicable State law. Nothing in this subsection prohibits any State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility from making any determination that it is not appropriate to implement any such standard, pursuant to its authority under otherwise applicable State law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedural requirements for consideration and determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The consideration referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be made after public notice and hearing. The determination referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in writing,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) based upon findings included in such determination and upon the evidence presented at the hearing, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) available to the public.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (1), in the second sentence of section 2622(a) of this title, and in sections 2631 and 2632 of this title, the procedures for the consideration and determination referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be those established by the State regulatory authority or the nonregulated electric utility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State regulatory authority (with respect to each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility may, to the extent consistent with otherwise applicable State law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) implement any such standard determined under subsection (a) of this section to be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) decline to implement any such standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a State regulatory authority (with respect to each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility declines to implement any standard established by subsection (d) of this section which is determined under subsection (a) of this section to be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, such authority or nonregulated electric utility shall state in writing the reasons therefor. Such statement of reasons shall be available to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a State regulatory authority implements a standard established by subsection (d)(7) or (8) of this section, such authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the impact that implementation of such standard would have on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation or servicing of energy conservation, energy efficiency or other demand side management measures, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) implement such standard so as to assure that utility actions would not provide such utilities with unfair competitive advantages over such small businesses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following Federal standards are hereby established:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cost of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Rates charged by any electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, to reflect the costs of providing electric service to such class, as determined under section 2625(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Declining block rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The energy component of a rate, or the amount attributable to the energy component in a rate, charged by any electric utility for providing electric service during any period to any class of electric consumers may not decrease as kilowatt-hour consumption by such class increases during such period except to the extent that such utility demonstrates that the costs to such utility of providing electric service to such class, which costs are attributable to such energy component, decrease as such consumption increases during such period.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1924 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time-of-day rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by any electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a time-of-day basis which reflects the costs of providing electric service to such class of electric consumers at different times of the day unless such rates are not cost-effective with respect to such class, as determined under section 2625(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Seasonal rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Interruptible rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall offer each industrial and commercial electric consumer an interruptible rate which reflects the cost of providing interruptible service to the class of which such consumer is a member.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Load management techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall offer to its electric consumers such load management techniques as the State regulatory authority (or the nonregulated electric utility) has determined will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be practicable and cost-effective, as determined under section 2625(c) of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be reliable, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide useful energy or capacity management advantages to the electric utility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Integrated resource planning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall employ integrated resource planning. All plans or filings before a State regulatory authority to meet the requirements of this paragraph must be updated on a regular basis, must provide the opportunity for public participation and comment, and contain a requirement that the plan be implemented.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Investments in conservation and demand management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates allowed to be charged by a State regulated electric utility shall be such that the utility's investment in and expenditures for energy conservation, energy efficiency resources, and other demand side management measures are at least as profitable, giving appropriate consideration to income lost from reduced sales due to investments in and expenditures for conservation and efficiency, as its investments in and expenditures for the construction of new generation, transmission, and distribution equipment. Such energy conservation, energy efficiency resources and other demand side management measures shall be appropriately monitored and evaluated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by any electric utility shall be such that the utility is encouraged to make investments in, and expenditures for, all cost-effective improvements in the energy efficiency of power generation, transmission and distribution. In considering regulatory changes to achieve the objectives of this paragraph, State regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities shall consider the disincentives caused by existing ratemaking policies, and practices, and consider incentives that would encourage better maintenance, and investment in more efficient power generation, transmission and distribution equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Consideration of the effects of wholesale power purchases on utility cost of capital; effects of leveraged capital structures on the reliability of wholesale power sellers; and assurance of adequate fuel supplies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To the extent that a State regulatory authority requires or allows electric utilities for which it has ratemaking authority to consider the purchase of long-term wholesale power supplies as a means of meeting electric demand, such authority shall perform a general evaluation of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the potential for increases or decreases in the costs of capital for such utilities, and any resulting increases or decreases in the retail rates paid by electric consumers, that may result from purchases of long-term wholesale power supplies in lieu of the construction of new generation facilities by such utilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) whether the use by exempt wholesale generators (as defined in section 79z&ndash;5a of title 15) of capital structures which employ proportionally greater amounts of debt than the capital structures of such utilities threatens reliability or provides an unfair advantage for exempt wholesale generators over such utilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) whether to implement procedures for the advance approval or disapproval of the purchase of a particular long-term wholesale power supply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) whether to require as a condition for the approval of the purchase of power that there be reasonable assurances of fuel supply adequacy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of implementing the provisions of this paragraph, any reference contained in this section to November 9, 1978, shall be deemed to be a reference to October 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a State regulatory authority from taking such action, including action with respect to the allowable capital structure of exempt wholesale generators, as such State regulatory authority may determine to be in the public interest as a result of performing evaluations under the standards of subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding section 2634 of this title and paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 2622(a) of this title, each State regulatory authority shall consider and make a determination concerning the standards of subparagraph (A) in accordance with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, without re<!-- PDFPage:1925 -->gard to any proceedings commenced prior to October 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c) of section 2622 of this title, each State regulatory authority shall consider and make a determination concerning whether it is appropriate to implement the standards set out in subparagraph (A) not later than one year after October 24, 1992.</p>
