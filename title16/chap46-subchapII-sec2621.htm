<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in writing,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) based upon findings included in such determination and upon the evidence presented at the hearing, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) available to the public.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (1), in the second sentence of section 2622(a) of this title, and in sections 2631 and 2632 of this title, the procedures for the consideration and determination referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be those established by the State regulatory authority or the nonregulated electric utility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State regulatory authority (with respect to each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility may, to the extent consistent with otherwise applicable State law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) implement any such standard determined under subsection (a) of this section to be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) decline to implement any such standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a State regulatory authority (with respect to each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility declines to implement any standard established by subsection (d) of this section which is determined under subsection (a) of this section to be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, such authority or nonregulated electric utility shall state in writing the reasons therefor. Such statement of reasons shall be available to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a State regulatory authority implements a standard established by subsection (d)(7) or (8) of this section, such authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the impact that implementation of such standard would have on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation or servicing of energy conservation, energy efficiency or other demand side management measures, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) implement such standard so as to assure that utility actions would not provide such utilities with unfair competitive advantages over such small businesses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following Federal standards are hereby established:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cost of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Rates charged by any electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, to reflect the costs of providing electric service to such class, as determined under section 2625(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Declining block rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The energy component of a rate, or the amount attributable to the energy component in a rate, charged by any electric utility for providing electric service during any period to any class of electric consumers may not decrease as kilowatt-hour consumption by such class increases during such period except to the extent that such utility demonstrates that the costs to such utility of providing electric service to such class, which costs are attributable to such energy component, decrease as such consumption increases during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time-of-day rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by any electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a time-of-day basis which reflects the costs of providing electric service to such class of electric consumers at different times of the day unless such rates are not cost-effective with respect to such class, as determined under section 2625(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Seasonal rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Interruptible rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall offer each industrial and commercial electric consumer an interruptible rate which reflects the cost of providing interruptible service to the class of which such consumer is a member.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Load management techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall offer to its electric consumers such load management techniques as the State regulatory authority (or the nonregulated electric utility) has determined will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be practicable and cost-effective, as determined under section 2625(c) of this title,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2048 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be reliable, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide useful energy or capacity management advantages to the electric utility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Integrated resource planning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall employ integrated resource planning. All plans or filings before a State regulatory authority to meet the requirements of this paragraph must be updated on a regular basis, must provide the opportunity for public participation and comment, and contain a requirement that the plan be implemented.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Investments in conservation and demand management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates allowed to be charged by a State regulated electric utility shall be such that the utility's investment in and expenditures for energy conservation, energy efficiency resources, and other demand side management measures are at least as profitable, giving appropriate consideration to income lost from reduced sales due to investments in and expenditures for conservation and efficiency, as its investments in and expenditures for the construction of new generation, transmission, and distribution equipment. Such energy conservation, energy efficiency resources and other demand side management measures shall be appropriately monitored and evaluated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by any electric utility shall be such that the utility is encouraged to make investments in, and expenditures for, all cost-effective improvements in the energy efficiency of power generation, transmission and distribution. In considering regulatory changes to achieve the objectives of this paragraph, State regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities shall consider the disincentives caused by existing ratemaking policies, and practices, and consider incentives that would encourage better maintenance, and investment in more efficient power generation, transmission and distribution equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Consideration of the effects of wholesale power purchases on utility cost of capital; effects of leveraged capital structures on the reliability of wholesale power sellers; and assurance of adequate fuel supplies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To the extent that a State regulatory authority requires or allows electric utilities for which it has ratemaking authority to consider the purchase of long-term wholesale power supplies as a means of meeting electric demand, such authority shall perform a general evaluation of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the potential for increases or decreases in the costs of capital for such utilities, and any resulting increases or decreases in the retail rates paid by electric consumers, that may result from purchases of long-term wholesale power supplies in lieu of the construction of new generation facilities by such utilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) whether the use by exempt wholesale generators (as defined in section 79z&ndash;5a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2621_1_target" name="2621_1">1</a></sup> of title 15) of capital structures which employ proportionally greater amounts of debt than the capital structures of such utilities threatens reliability or provides an unfair advantage for exempt wholesale generators over such utilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) whether to implement procedures for the advance approval or disapproval of the purchase of a particular long-term wholesale power supply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) whether to require as a condition for the approval of the purchase of power that there be reasonable assurances of fuel supply adequacy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of implementing the provisions of this paragraph, any reference contained in this section to November 9, 1978, shall be deemed to be a reference to October 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a State regulatory authority from taking such action, including action with respect to the allowable capital structure of exempt wholesale generators, as such State regulatory authority may determine to be in the public interest as a result of performing evaluations under the standards of subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding section 2634 of this title and paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 2622(a) of this title, each State regulatory authority shall consider and make a determination concerning the standards of subparagraph (A) in accordance with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, without regard to any proceedings commenced prior to October 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c) of section 2622 of this title, each State regulatory authority shall consider and make a determination concerning whether it is appropriate to implement the standards set out in subparagraph (A) not later than one year after October 24, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Net metering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall make available upon request net metering service to any electric consumer that the electric utility serves. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;net metering service&rdquo; means service to an electric consumer under which electric energy generated by that electric consumer from an eligible on-site generating facility and delivered to the local distribution facilities may be used to offset electric energy provided by the electric utility to the electric consumer during the applicable billing period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(12) Fuel sources</h4>

The time-based rate schedule shall enable the electric consumer to manage energy use and cost through advanced metering and communications technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The types of time-based rate schedules that may be offered under the schedule referred to in subparagraph (A) include, among others&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) time-of-use pricing whereby electricity prices are set for a specific time period on an advance or forward basis, typically not changing more often than twice a year, based on the utility's cost of generating and/or purchasing such electricity at the wholesale level for the benefit of the consumer. Prices paid for energy consumed during these periods shall be pre-established and known to consumers in advance of such consumption, allowing them to vary their demand and usage in response to such prices and manage their energy costs by shifting usage to a lower cost period or reducing their consumption overall;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) critical peak pricing whereby time-of-use prices are in effect except for certain peak days, when prices may reflect the costs of generating and/or purchasing electricity at the wholesale level and when consumers may receive additional discounts for reducing peak period energy consumption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) real-time pricing whereby electricity prices are set for a specific time period on an advanced or forward basis, reflecting the utility's cost of generating and/or purchasing electricity at the wholesale level, and may change as often as hourly; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) credits for consumers with large loads who enter into pre-established peak load reduction agreements that reduce a utility's planned capacity obligations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Each electric utility subject to subparagraph (A) shall provide each customer requesting a time-based rate with a time-based meter capable of enabling the utility and customer to offer and receive such rate, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For purposes of implementing this paragraph, any reference contained in this section to November 9, 1978, shall be deemed to be a reference to August 8, 2005.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In a State that permits third-party marketers to sell electric energy to retail electric consumers, such consumers shall be entitled to receive the same time-based metering and communications device and service as a retail electric consumer of the electric utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c) of section 2622 of this title, each State regulatory authority shall, not later than 18 months after August 8, 2005, conduct an investigation in accordance with section 2625(i) of this title and issue a decision whether it is appropriate to implement the standards set out in subparagraphs (A) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(15) Interconnection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall make available, upon request, interconnection service to any electric consumer that the electric utility serves. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;interconnection service&rdquo; means service to an electric consumer under which an on-site generating facility on the consumer's premises shall be connected to the local distribution facilities. Interconnection services shall be offered based upon the standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers: IEEE Standard 1547 for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems, as they may be amended from time to time. In addition, agreements and procedures shall be established whereby the services are offered shall promote current best practices of interconnection for distributed generation, including but not limited to practices stipulated in model codes adopted by associations of state regulatory agencies. All such agreements and procedures shall be just and reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.</p>
