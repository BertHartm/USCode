<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">In furtherance of the findings and policy stated in section 5951 of this title, and except as provided by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, the Secretary shall utilize concessions contracts to authorize a person, corporation, or other entity to provide accommodations, facilities, and services to visitors to units of the National Park System. Such concessions contracts shall be awarded as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Competitive selection process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, all proposed concessions contracts shall be awarded by the Secretary to the person, corporation, or other entity submitting the best proposal, as determined by the Secretary through a competitive selection process. Such competitive process shall include simplified procedures for small, individually-owned, concessions contracts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Solicitation of proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, prior to awarding a new concessions contract (including renewals or extensions of existing concessions contracts) the Secretary shall publicly solicit proposals for the concessions contract and, in connection with such solicitation, the Secretary shall prepare a prospectus and shall publish notice of its availability at least once in local or national newspapers or trade publications, and/or the Commerce Business Daily, as appropriate, and shall make the prospectus available upon request to all interested parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prospectus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The prospectus shall include the following information:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2381 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The minimum requirements for such contract as set forth in paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The terms and conditions of any existing concessions contract relating to the services and facilities to be provided, including all fees and other forms of compensation provided to the United States by the concessioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Other authorized facilities or services which may be provided in a proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Facilities and services to be provided by the Secretary to the concessioner, if any, including public access, utilities, and buildings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) An estimate of the amount of compensation, if any, due an existing concessioner from a new concessioner under the terms of a prior concessions contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) A statement as to the weight to be given to each selection factor identified in the prospectus and the relative importance of such factors in the selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Such other information related to the proposed concessions operation as is provided to the Secretary pursuant to a concessions contract or is otherwise available to the Secretary, as the Secretary determines is necessary to allow for the submission of competitive proposals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Where applicable, a description of a preferential right to the renewal of the proposed concessions contract held by an existing concessioner as set forth in paragraph (7).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Minimum requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) No proposal shall be considered which fails to meet the minimum requirements as determined by the Secretary. Such minimum requirements shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The minimum acceptable franchise fee or other forms of consideration to the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Any facilities, services, or capital investment required to be provided by the concessioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Measures necessary to ensure the protection, conservation, and preservation of resources of the unit of the National Park System.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall reject any proposal, regardless of the franchise fee offered, if the Secretary determines that the person, corporation, or entity is not qualified, is not likely to provide satisfactory service, or that the proposal is not responsive to the objectives of protecting and preserving resources of the unit of the National Park System and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If all proposals submitted to the Secretary either fail to meet the minimum requirements or are rejected by the Secretary, the Secretary shall establish new minimum contract requirements and re-initiate the competitive selection process pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Secretary may not execute a concessions contract which materially amends or does not incorporate the proposed terms and conditions of the concessions contract as set forth in the applicable prospectus. If proposed material amendments or changes are considered appropriate by the Secretary, the Secretary shall resolicit offers for the concessions contract incorporating such material amendments or changes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Selection of the best proposal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In selecting the best proposal, the Secretary shall consider the following principal factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the unit of the National Park System and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The experience and related background of the person, corporation, or entity submitting the proposal, including the past performance and expertise of such person, corporation or entity in providing the same or similar facilities or services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The financial capability of the person, corporation, or entity submitting the proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) The proposed franchise fee, except that consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the unit of the National Park System and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities to the public at reasonable rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary may also consider such secondary factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In developing regulations to implement this subchapter, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which plans for employment of Indians (including Native Alaskans) and involvement of businesses owned by Indians, Indian tribes, or Native Alaskans in the operation of a concession, contracts&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5952_1_target" name="5952_1">1</a></sup> should be identified as a factor in the selection of a best proposal under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Congressional notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall submit any proposed concessions contract with anticipated annual gross receipts in excess of $5,000,000 or a duration of more than 10 years to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate. The Secretary shall not award any such proposed contract until at least 60 days subsequent to the notification of both committees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Preferential right of renewal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall not grant a concessioner a preferential right to renew a concessions contract, or any other form of preference to a concessions contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall grant a preferential right of renewal to an existing concessioner with respect to proposed renewals of the categories of concessions contracts described by <!-- PDFPage:2382 -->paragraph (8), subject to the requirements of that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) As used in this subchapter, the term &ldquo;preferential right of renewal&rdquo; means that the Secretary, subject to a determination by the Secretary that the facilities or services authorized by a prior contract continue to be necessary and appropriate within the meaning of section 5951 of this title, shall allow a concessioner qualifying for a preferential right of renewal the opportunity to match the terms and conditions of any competing proposal which the Secretary determines to be the best proposal for a proposed new concessions contract which authorizes the continuation of the facilities and services provided by the concessioner under its prior contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A concessioner which successfully exercises a preferential right of renewal in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter shall be entitled to award of the proposed new concessions contract to which such preference applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Outfitter and guide services and small contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The provisions of paragraph (7) shall apply only to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Subject to subparagraph (B), outfitting and guide concessions contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Subject to subparagraph (C), concessions contracts with anticipated annual gross receipts under $500,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For the purposes of this subchapter, an &ldquo;outfitting and guide concessions contract&rdquo; means a concessions contract which solely authorizes the provision of specialized backcountry outdoor recreation guide services which require the employment of specially trained and experienced guides to accompany park visitors in the backcountry so as to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for visitors who otherwise may not have the skills and equipment to engage in such activity. Outfitting and guide concessioners, where otherwise qualified, include concessioners which provide guided river running, hunting, fishing, horseback, camping, and mountaineering experiences. An outfitting and guide concessioner is entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this subchapter only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the contract with the outfitting and guide concessioner does not grant the concessioner any interest, including any leasehold surrender interest or possessory interest, in capital improvements on lands owned by the United States within a unit of the National Park System, other than a capital improvement constructed by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concessions contract prior to November 13, 1998, or constructed or owned by a concessioner or his or her predecessor before the subject land was incorporated into the National Park System;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Secretary determines that the concessioner has operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract (including any extension thereof); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new contract which satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A concessioner that holds a concessions contract that the Secretary estimates will result in gross annual receipts of less than $500,000 if renewed shall be entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this subchapter if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary to determine whether to issue a concessions contract or to establish its terms and conditions in furtherance of the policies expressed in this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Secretary may award, without public solicitation, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A temporary concessions contract or an extension of an existing concessions contract for a term not to exceed 3 years in order to avoid interruption of services to the public at a unit of the National Park System, except that prior to making such an award, the Secretary shall take all reasonable and appropriate steps to consider alternatives to avoid such interruption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A concessions contract in extraordinary circumstances where compelling and equitable considerations require the award of a concessions contract to a particular party in the public interest. Such award of a concessions contract shall not be made by the Secretary until at least 30 days after publication in the Federal Register of notice of the Secretary's intention to do so and the reasons for such action, and submission of notice to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Leasehold surrender interest under new concessions contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On or after November 13, 1998, a concessioner that constructs a capital improvement upon land owned by the United States within a unit of the National Park System pursuant to a concessions contract shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in each capital improvement constructed by a concessioner under a concessions contract, consisting solely of a right to compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A leasehold surrender interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the acquisition of a concessions contract when approved by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concessions contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other termination of a concessions contract and may not be taken for public use except on payment of just compensation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), increased (or decreased) in the same percentage increase (or decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Effective 9 years after November 13, 1998, the Secretary may provide, in any particular new concession contract the Secretary estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be based on either (A) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of years as the time period associated with the straight line depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and regulations in effect on the day before November 13, 1998, or (B) such alternative formula that is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter. The Secretary may only use such an alternative formula if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in this particular concession contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that such alternative formula is, compared to the standard method of determining value provided for in paragraph (3), necessary in order to provide a fair return to the Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in response to a solicitation that includes such an alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a concessions contract, makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of such additional capital improvement shall be added to the then current value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule for existing possessory interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A concessioner which has obtained a possessory interest as defined pursuant to Public Law 89&ndash;249 (commonly known as the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act; 16 U.S.C. 20 et seq.), as in effect on the day before November 13, 1998, under the terms of a concessions contract entered into before November 13, 1998, shall, upon the expiration or termination of such contract, be entitled to receive compensation for such possessory interest improvements in the amount and manner as described by such concessions contract. Where such a possessory interest is not described in the existing contract, compensation of possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws in effect on the day before November 13, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event such prior concessioner is awarded a new concessions contract after the effective date of this subchapter replacing an existing concessions contract, the existing concessioner shall, instead of directly receiving such possessory interest compensation, have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new contract and shall carry over as the initial value of such leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as <!-- PDFPage:2384 -->of the termination date of the previous contract.

A successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement under the terms of a new contract and the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement (instead of construction cost) shall be the amount of money the new concessioner is required to pay the prior concessioner for its leasehold surrender interest under the terms of the prior concessions contract.</p>

The approval process utilized by the Secretary shall be as prompt and as unburdensome to the concessioner as possible and shall rely on market forces to establish reasonableness of rates and charges to the maximum extent practicable. The Secretary shall approve rates and charges that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and appropriate. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the reasonableness and appropriateness of rates and charges shall be determined primarily by comparison with those rates and charges for facilities, goods, and services of comparable character under similar conditions, with due consideration to the following factors and other factors deemed relevant by the Secretary: length of season, peakloads, average percentage of occupancy, accessibility, availability and costs of labor and materials, and type of patronage.

<p class="statutory-body">A concessions contract shall provide for payment to the government of a franchise fee or such other monetary consideration as determined by the Secretary, upon consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of the privileges granted by the particular contract involved. Such probable value shall be based upon a reasonable opportunity for net profit in relation to capital invested and the obligations of the contract. Consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting and preserving park areas and of providing necessary and appropriate services for visitors at reasonable rates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of franchise fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the franchise fee or other monetary consideration paid to the United States for the term of the concessions contract shall be specified in the concessions contract and may only be modified to reflect extraordinary unanticipated changes from the conditions anticipated as of the effective date of the contract. The Secretary shall include in concessions contracts with a term of more than 5 years a provision which allows reconsideration of the franchise fee at the request of the Secretary or the concessioner in the event of such extraordinary unanticipated changes. Such provision shall provide for binding arbitration in the event that the Secretary and the concessioner are unable to agree upon an adjustment to the franchise fee in these circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All franchise fees (and other monetary consideration) paid to the United States pursuant to concessions contracts shall be deposited into a special account established in the Treasury of the United States. Twenty percent of the funds deposited in the special account shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without further appropriation, to support activities throughout the National Park System regardless of the unit of the National Park System in which the funds were collected. The funds deposited into the special account shall remain available until expended.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">There shall be established within the special account required under subsection (c) of this section a subaccount for each unit of the National Park System.

The funds credited to the subaccount for a unit of the National Park System shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without further appropriation, for use at the unit for visitor services and for purposes of funding high-priority and urgently necessary resource management programs and operations.

<p class="statutory-body">To the extent specified in this section, the Secretary, upon request, may authorize a private person, corporation, or other entity to provide services to visitors to units of the National Park System through a commercial use authorization. Such authorizations shall not be considered as concessions contracts pursuant to this subchapter nor shall other sections of this subchapter be applicable to such authorizations except where expressly so stated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria for issuance of authorizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority of this section may be used only to authorize provision of services that the Secretary determines will have minimal impact on resources and values of the unit of the National Park System and are consistent with the purpose for which the unit was established and with all applicable management plans and park policies and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Elements of authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require payment of a reasonable fee for issuance of an authorization under this section, such fees to remain available without further appropriation to be used, at a minimum, to recover associated management and administrative costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require that the provision of services under such an authorization be accomplished in a manner consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of park resources and values;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take appropriate steps to limit the liability of the United States arising from the provision of services under such an authorization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) have no authority under this section to issue more authorizations than are consistent with the preservation and proper management of park resources and values, and shall establish such other conditions for issuance of such an authorization as the Secretary determines appropriate for the protection of visitors, provision of adequate and appropriate visitor services, and protection and proper management of the resources and values of the park.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any authorization issued under this section shall be limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) commercial operations with annual gross receipts of not more than $25,000 resulting from services originating and provided solely within a unit of the National Park System pursuant to such authorization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the incidental use of resources of the unit by commercial operations which provide services originating and terminating outside of the boundaries of the unit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such uses by organized children's camps, outdoor clubs and nonprofit institutions (including back country use) and such other uses as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nonprofit institutions are not required to obtain commercial use authorizations unless taxable income is derived by the institution from the authorized use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prohibition on construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An authorization issued under this section shall not provide for the construction of any structure, fixture, or improvement on federally-owned lands within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Duration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term of any authorization issued under this section shall not exceed 2 years. No preferential right of renewal or similar provisions for renewal shall be granted by the Secretary.</p>
