<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Land enrolled in other conservation programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the following land is not be&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3838e_1_target" name="3838e_1">1</a></sup> eligible for enrollment in the program:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Submission of contract offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to participate in the conservation stewardship program, a producer shall submit to the Secretary for approval a contract offer that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the producer, at the time of the contract offer, is meeting the stewardship threshold for at least one resource concern; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2158 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) would, at a minimum, meet or exceed the stewardship threshold for at least 1 priority resource concern by the end of the stewardship contract by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) installing and adopting additional conservation activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) improving, maintaining, and managing conservation activities in place at the operation of the producer at the time the contract offer is accepted by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating contract offers made by producers to enter into contracts under the program, the Secretary shall rank applications based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the level of conservation treatment on all applicable priority resource concerns at the time of application, based to the maximum extent practicable on conservation measurement tools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the degree to which the proposed conservation treatment on applicable priority resource concerns effectively increases conservation performance, based to the maximum extent possible on conservation measurement tools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the number of applicable priority resource concerns proposed to be treated to meet or exceed the stewardship threshold by the end of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the extent to which other resource concerns, in addition to priority resource concerns, will be addressed to meet or exceed the stewardship threshold by the end of the contract period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the extent to which the actual and anticipated environmental benefits from the contract are provided at the least cost relative to other similarly beneficial contract offers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not assign a higher priority to any application because the applicant is willing to accept a lower payment than the applicant would otherwise be eligible to receive.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Additional criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may develop and use such additional criteria for evaluating applications to enroll in the program that the Secretary determines are necessary to ensure that national, State, and local conservation priorities are effectively addressed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Entering into contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After a determination that a producer is eligible for the program under subsection (a), and a determination that the contract offer ranks sufficiently high under the evaluation criteria under subsection (b), the Secretary shall enter into a conservation stewardship contract with the producer to enroll the land to be covered by the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contract provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Term</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A conservation stewardship contract shall be for a term of 5 years.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Involuntary termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may terminate a contract under this subpart if the Secretary determines that the producer violated the contract.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2159 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Repayment</h4>
