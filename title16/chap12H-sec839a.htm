<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;Conservation&rdquo; means any reduction in electric power consumption as a result of increases in the efficiency of energy use, production, or distribution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) &ldquo;Cost-effective&rdquo;, when applied to any measure or resource referred to in this chapter, means that such measure or resource must be forecast&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to be reliable and available within the time it is needed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to meet or reduce the electric power demand, as determined by the Council or the Administrator, as appropriate, of the Consumers of the customers at an estimated incremental system cost no greater than that of the least-cost similarly reliable and available alternative measure or resource, or any combination thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;system cost&rdquo; means an estimate of all direct costs of a measure or resource over its effective life, including, if applicable, the cost of distribution and transmission to the consumer and, among other factors, waste disposal costs, end-of-cycle costs, and fuel costs (including projected increases), and such quantifiable environmental costs and benefits as the Administrator determines, on the basis of a methodology developed by the Council as part of the plan, or in the absence of the plan by the Administrator, are directly attributable to such measure or resource.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In determining the amount of power that a conservation measure or other resource may be expected to save or to produce, the Council or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall take into account projected realization factors and plant factors, including appropriate historical experience with similar measures or resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the &ldquo;estimated incremental system cost&rdquo; of any conservation measure or resource shall not be treated as greater than that of any nonconservation measure or resource unless the incremental system cost of such conservation measure or resource is in excess of 110 per centum of the incremental system cost of the nonconservation measure or resource.</p>
