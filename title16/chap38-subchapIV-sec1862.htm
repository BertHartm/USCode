<p class="statutory-body">The North Pacific Fishery Management Council may prepare, in consultation with the Secretary, a fisheries research plan for all fisheries under the Council's jurisdiction except salmon fisheries which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) requires that observers be stationed on fishing vessels engaged in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish and on United States fish processors fishing for or processing species under the jurisdiction of the Council, including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery, for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of any fisheries under the Council's jurisdiction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establishes a system of fees to pay for the costs of implementing the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any plan or plan amendment prepared under this section shall be reasonably calculated to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be fair and equitable to all participants in the fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Council, including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1604 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide that fees collected not be used to pay any costs of administrative overhead or other costs not directly incurred in carrying out the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) not be used to offset amounts authorized under other provisions of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) be expressed as a percentage, not to exceed 2 percent, of the unprocessed ex-vessel value of fish and shellfish harvested under the jurisdiction of the Council, including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) be assessed against all fishing vessels and United States fish processors, including those not required to carry an observer under the plan, participating in fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Council, including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) provide that fees collected will be deposited in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund established under subsection (d) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) provide that fees collected will only be used for implementing the plan established under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) meet the requirements of section 9701(b) of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 60 days after receiving a plan or plan amendment from the North Pacific Council under this section, the Secretary shall review such plan or plan amendment and either (A) remand such plan or plan amendment to the Council with comments if it does not meet the requirements of this section, or (B) publish in the Federal Register proposed regulations for implementing such plan or plan amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the 60-day public comment period, the Secretary shall conduct a public hearing in each State represented on the Council for the purpose of receiving public comments on the proposed regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 45 days of the close of the public comment period, the Secretary, in consultation with the Council, shall analyze the public comment received and publish final regulations for implementing such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary remands a plan or plan amendment to the Council for failure to meet the requirements of this section, the Council may resubmit such plan or plan amendment at any time after taking action the Council believes will address the defects identified by the Secretary.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the availability of comprehensive commercial insurance for vessel and owner liability against civil suits by observers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
