In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall undertake a program of, and shall provide financial assistance for, research into new methods of locating and catching yellowfin tuna without the incidental taking of marine mammals.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of identifying appropriate research into promising new methods of locating and catching yellowfin tuna without the incidental taking of marine mammals, the Secretary shall contract for an independent review of information pertaining to such potential alternative methods to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences with individuals having scientific, technical, or other expertise that may be relevant to the identification of promising alternative fishing techniques. The Secretary shall request that the independent review be submitted to the Secretary on or before September 8, 1989, and the Secretary shall submit the report of the independent review, together with a proposed plan for research, development, and implementation of alternative fishing techniques, to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives on or before December 5, 1989.</p>

The workshop shall be conducted in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission, the adjacent coastal States, individuals with expertise in marine mammal biology and ecology, representatives from environmental organizations, the fishing industry, and other appropriate persons. The goal of the workshop shall be to identify such factors, and to recommend a program of research and management to restore or maintain that marine ecosystem and its key components that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) protects and encourages marine mammals to develop to the greatest extent feasible commensurate with sound policies of resource management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has as the primary management objective the maintenance of the health and stability of the marine ecosystems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) ensures the fullest possible range of management options for future generations; and</p>
