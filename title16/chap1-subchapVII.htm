<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary; administrative sites; manner and place; donation of State lands; reverters and other conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands and interests in land within the boundaries of <!-- PDFPage:93 -->the Redwood National Park and, in addition thereto, not more than ten acres outside of those boundaries for an administrative site or sites. Such acquisition may be by donation, purchase with appropriated or donated funds, exchange, or otherwise, but lands and interests in land owned by the State of California may be acquired only by donation which donation of lands or interest in lands may be accepted in the discretion of the Secretary subject to such preexisting reverters and other conditions as may appear in the title to these lands held by the State of California, and such other reverters and conditions as may be consistent with the use and management of the donated lands as a portion of Redwood National Park. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may expend appropriated funds for the management of and for the construction, design, and maintenance of permanent improvements on such lands and interests in land as are donated by the State of California in a manner not inconsistent with such reverters and other conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Vested and possessory rights in certain real property; termination of operations; removal of equipment, facilities, and personal property; down tree personal property; acquired roads; just compensation; payment; jurisdiction; acreage limitation; notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Effective on October 2, 1968, there is hereby vested in the United States all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of, all real property within the park boundaries designated in maps NPS&ndash;RED&ndash;7114&ndash;A and NPS&ndash;RED&ndash;7114&ndash;B and effective on March 27, 1978, there is hereby vested in the United States all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of, all real property within the area indicated as &ldquo;Proposed Additions&rdquo; on the map entitled &ldquo;Additional Lands, Redwood National Park, California,&rdquo; numbered 167&ndash;80005&ndash;D and dated March 1978, and all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of the down tree personal property (trees severed from the ground by man) severed prior to January 1, 1975, or subsequent to January 31, 1978, within the area indicated as &ldquo;Proposed Additions&rdquo; on the map entitled &ldquo;Additional Lands, Redwood National Park, California,&rdquo; numbered 167&ndash;80005&ndash;D and dated March 1978, except real property owned by the State of California or a political subdivision thereof and except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection. The Secretary shall allow for the orderly termination of all operations on real property acquired by the United States under this subsection, and for the removal of equipment, facilities, and personal property therefrom.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Down tree personal property severed subsequent to December 31, 1974, and prior to February 1, 1978 may be removed in accordance with applicable State and Federal law, or other applicable licenses, permits, and existing agreements, unless the Secretary determines that the removal of such down timber would damage second growth resources or result in excessive sedimentation in Redwood Creek: <em>Provided, however</em>, That down timber lying in stream beds may not be removed without permission of the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That such removal shall also be subject to such reasonable conditions as may be required by the Secretary to insure the continued availability of raw materials to Redwoods United, Incorporated, a nonprofit corporation located in Manila, California.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall permit, at existing levels and extent of access and use, continued access and use of each acquired segment of the B line, L line, M line, and K and K roads by each current affected woods employer or its successor in title and interest: <em>Provided</em>, That such use is limited to forest and land management and protection purposes, including timber harvesting and road maintenance. The Secretary shall permit, at existing levels and extent of access and use, continued access and use of acquired portions of the Bald Hills road by each current affected woods employer or its successor in title and interest: <em>Provided further</em>, That nothing in this sentence shall diminish the authority of the Secretary to otherwise regulate the use of the Bald Hills road.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The United States will pay just compensation to the owner of any real property taken by paragraph (1) of this subsection. Such compensation shall be paid either: (A) by the Secretary of the Treasury from money appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, including money appropriated to the Fund pursuant to section 4(b) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, as amended [16 U.S.C. 460<em>l</em>&ndash;7(b)] subject to the appropriation limitation in section 79j of this title, upon certification to him by the Secretary of the agreed negotiated value of such property, or the valuation of the property awarded by judgment, including interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date of taking the property to the date of payment therefor; or (B) by the Secretary, if the owner of the land concurs, with any federally owned property available to him for purposes of exchange pursuant to the provisions of section 79e of this title; or (C) by the Secretary using any combination of such money or federally owned property. Any action against the United States with regard to the provisions of this subchapter and for the recovery of just compensation for the lands and interests therein taken by the United States, and for the down tree personal property taken, shall be brought in the United States district court for the district where the land is located without regard to the amount claimed. The United States may initiate proceedings at any time seeking a determination of just compensation in the district court in the manner provided by sections 1358 and 1403 of title 28 and may deposit in the registry of the court the estimated just compensation, or a part thereof, in accordance with the procedure generally described by section 3114(a)&ndash;(d) of title 40. Interest shall not be allowed on such amounts as shall have been paid into the court. In the event that the Secretary determines that the fee simple title to any property (real or personal) taken under this section is not necessary for the purposes of this subchapter, he may, with particular attention to minimizing the payment of severance damages and to allow for the orderly removal of down timber, revest title to such property subject to such reservations, terms, and <!-- PDFPage:94 -->conditions, if any, as he deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, and may compensate the former owner for no more than the fair market value of the rights so reserved, except that the Secretary may not revest title to any property for which just compensation has been paid; or, the Secretary may sell at fair market value without regard to the requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, such down timber as in his judgment may be removed without damage to the park, the proceeds from such sales being credited to the Treasury of the United States. If the State of California designates a right-of-way for a bypass highway around the eastern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park prior to October 1, 1984, the Secretary is authorized and directed to acquire such lands or interests in lands as may be necessary for such a highway and, subject to such conditions as the Secretary may determine are necessary to assure the adequate protection of Redwood National Park, shall thereupon donate the designated right-of-way to the State of California for a new bypass highway from a point south of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park through the drainage of May Creek and Boyes Creek to extend along the eastern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park within Humboldt County. Such acreage as may be necessary in the judgment of the Secretary for this conveyance, and for a buffer thereof, shall be deemed to be a publicly owned highway for purposes of section 79b(a) of this title effective on March 27, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall apply to ownerships of fifty acres or less only if such ownerships are held or occupied primarily for nonresidential or nonagricultural purposes, and if the Secretary gives notice to the owner within sixty days after October 2, 1968, of the application of this subsection. Notice by the Secretary shall be deemed to have been made as of October 2, 1968. The district court of the United States for that district in which such ownerships are located shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action brought by any person having an interest therein for damages occurring by reason of the temporary application of this paragraph, between October 2, 1968, and the date upon which the Secretary gives such notice. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as affecting the authority of the Secretary under subsections (a) and (c) of this section to acquire such areas for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Minimization of severance damages; costs not chargeable against appropriations authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any individual tract or parcel of land acquired is partly inside and partly outside the boundaries of the park or the administrative site the Secretary may, in order to minimize the payment of severance damages, acquire the whole of the tract or parcel and exchange that part of it which is outside the boundaries for land or interests in land inside the boundaries or for other land or interests in land acquired pursuant to this subchapter, and dispose of so much thereof as is not so utilized in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended. The cost of any land so acquired and disposed of shall not be charged against the limitation on authorized appropriations contained in section 79j of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Lands for screen of trees along certain highway</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is further authorized to acquire, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, lands and interests in land bordering both sides of the highway between the present southern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park and a point on Redwood Creek near the town of Orick to a depth sufficient to maintain or to restore a screen of trees between the highway and the land behind the screen and the activities conducted thereon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Timber, soil, and stream protection; &ldquo;interests in land&rdquo; defined; notice to Congress of intended action, costs, and benefits requisite for acquisitions, contracts, or cooperative agreements; availability of funds; authorization of appropriations; rehabilitative activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to afford as full protection as is reasonably possible to the timber, soil, and streams within the boundaries of the park, the Secretary is authorized, by any of the means set out in subsections (a) and (c) of this section, to acquire interests in land from, and to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, the owners of land on the periphery of the park and on watersheds tributary to streams within the park designed to assure that the consequences of forestry management, timbering, land use, and soil conservation practices conducted thereon, or of the lack of such practices, will not adversely affect the timber, soil, and streams within the park as aforesaid. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;interests in land&rdquo; does not include fee title unless the Secretary finds that the cost of a necessary less-than-fee interest would be disproportionately high as compared with the estimated cost of the fee. No acquisition other than by donation shall be effectuated and no contract or cooperative agreement shall be executed by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this subsection until after he has notified the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of his intended action and of the costs and benefits to the United States involved therein. Effective on March 27, 1978, there are made available from the amounts provided in section 79j of this title or as may be hereafter provided such sums as may be necessary for the acquisition of interests in land. Effective on October 1, 1978, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for the implementation of contracts and cooperative agreements pursuant to this subsection: <em>Provided</em>, That it is the express intent of Congress that the Secretary shall to the greatest degree possible insure that such contracts and cooperative agreements provide for the maximum retention of senior employees by such owners and for their utilization in rehabilitation and other efforts. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, is further authorized, pursuant to contract or cooperative agreement with agencies of the Fed<!-- PDFPage:95 -->eral Executive, the State of California, any political or governmental subdivision thereof, any corporation, not-for-profit corporation, private entity or person, to initiate, provide funds, equipment, and personnel for the development and implementation of a program for the rehabilitation of areas within and upstream from the park contributing significant sedimentation because of past logging disturbances and road conditions, and, to the extent feasible, to reduce risk of damage to streamside areas adjacent to Redwood Creek and for other reasons: <em>Provided further</em>, That authority to make payments under this subsection shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Such contracts or cooperative agreements shall be subject to such other conditions as the Secretary may determine necessary to assure the adequate protection of Redwood National Park generally, and to provide employment opportunities to those individuals affected by this taking and to contribute to the economic revival of Del Norte and Humboldt Counties in northern California. The Secretary shall undertake and publish studies on erosion and sedimentation originating within the hydrographic basin of Redwood Creek with particular effort to identify sources and causes, including differentiation between natural and man-aggravated conditions, and shall adapt his general management plan to benefit from the results of such studies. The Secretary, or the Secretary of Agriculture, where appropriate, shall also manage any additional Federal lands under his jurisdiction that are within the hydrographic basin of Redwood Creek in a manner which will minimize sedimentation which could affect the park, and in coordination with plans for sediment management within the basin. To effectuate the provisions of this subsection, and to further develop scientific and professional information and data concerning the Redwood Forest ecosystem, and the various factors that may affect it, the Secretary may authorize access to the area subject to this subsection by designated representatives of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Private employer requirements for filling covered employment positions with affected employees pursuant to Federal contracts, etc.; procedures applicable and considerations for employment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any Federal agency involved in the manner provided herein with a private employer responsible for filing&nbsp;<sup><a href="#79l_1_target" name="79l_1">1</a></sup> an employment position that is within the scope of clause (2)(A) of subsection (d) of this section, that will be primarily located in Humboldt or Del Norte Counties, or other counties in California adjacent thereto, is directed to require that any Federal contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of funding assistance, and any Federal lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use, not constituting an existing property right as of March 27, 1978, that is a condition to or a requirement of the conduct of harvesting and related activities or replanting and land rehabilitation or the conduct of wood processing and related activities or the conduct of highway construction and related activities shall be subject to and conditioned upon said private employer giving full consideration to affected employees as provided herein.</p>

The execution and carrying out of such an agreement, or the giving of full consideration to the employment of affected employees under subsection (c) of this section, shall not subject an employer to any additional liability or obligations under any Federal or State equal employment law, rule, regulation, or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Implementation of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, except as otherwise provided, shall be responsible for the implementation of this section and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is authorized and directed to make needed training available, upon application, to an affected employee applicant who, although not presently qualified for a position, can be reasonably expected to be qualified after appropriate training;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is authorized to take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that an affected employee is not denied full consideration because of the need for training where there is no substantial reason to believe that the applicant would be unable to perform the duties of the job after proper training. If the job is one which must be filled while the affected employee would be in training, the Secretary shall encourage the employer to fill the job only on a temporary basis subject to the successful completion of the training by the affected employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall require that, in a case in which two or more affected employee applicants have approximately equal qualifications for a job for which they are to receive full consideration, that applicant with the greatest creditable service shall be given preference among those applicants entitled to full consideration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) upon the filing of a complaint by an employee who alleges that said employee's rights to full consideration were disregarded, the Secretary shall make a finding on the merits of such complaint. If it is determined that there has been noncompliance with this section, the Secretary shall take such action as may be appropriate to correct the situation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To assist in implementing this section, agencies shall notify the Secretary, in advance, of any job opening as provided for by subsection (d) of this section and of any Federal commitment as provided for by subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) appoint, from among nominees proposed by certified or recognized unions representing employees, a person or persons who shall serve as the Secretary's liaison with employees and <!-- PDFPage:100 -->their union and as consultant to the Secretary with regard to the administration of those provisions of this Act for which the Secretary is responsible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Judicial review of determination of Secretary respecting employee, etc.; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An employee, a group of employees, a certified or recognized union, or an authorized representative of such employee or group, aggrieved by any determination by the Secretary under this Act shall be entitled to judicial review of such determination in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided by section 2395 of title 19, except that such review shall be in the appropriate court of appeals of the United States, and the judgment of such court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Additional or alternative rights under existing labor laws, regulations, or contracts unaffected; compensation of employees appointed to Federal jobs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any additional or alternative rights under a law, regulation, or contract (including, but not limited to, veteran preference and contracts between private employers and unions) in effect as of March 27, 1978, and the implementation of this section shall be carried out in accord with applicable civil service laws and regulations except as otherwise provided for in this section.
