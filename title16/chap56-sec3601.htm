<p class="note-body">An Act to provide for the conservation and management of the fisheries, and for other purposes, approved April 13, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), referred to in par. (1), is Pub. L. 94&ndash;265, Apr. 13, 1976, 90 Stat. 331, as amended, known as the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which is classified principally to chapter 38 (&sect;1801 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1801 of this title and Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 3 of the Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1802), referred to in pars. (6) and (8), was subsequently amended, and section 3(10) and (19) no longer defines the terms &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; and &ldquo;person&rdquo;. However, such terms are defined elsewhere in that section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 3602 of this title, referred to in par. (3), was in the original &ldquo;section 403 of this title&rdquo;, meaning section 403 of title III of Pub. L. 97&ndash;389, and has been translated as section 3602 of this title, section 303 of title III of Pub. L. 97&ndash;389, as the probable intent of Congress, because title III of Pub. L. 97&ndash;389 does not contain a section 403 and section 3602 of this title relates to appointment of a United States Commissioner.</p>
