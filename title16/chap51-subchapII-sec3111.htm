<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3111. Congressional declaration of findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the continuation of the opportunity for subsistence uses by rural residents of Alaska, including both Natives and non-Natives, on the public lands and by Alaska Natives on Native lands is essential to Native physical, economic, traditional, and cultural existence and to non-Native physical, economic, traditional, and social existence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the situation in Alaska is unique in that, in most cases, no practical alternative means are available to replace the food supplies and other items gathered from fish and wildlife which supply rural residents dependent on subsistence uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) continuation of the opportunity for subsistence uses of resources on public and other lands in Alaska is threatened by the increasing population of Alaska, with resultant pressure on subsistence resources, by sudden decline in the populations of some wildlife species which are crucial subsistence resources, by increased accessibility of remote areas containing subsistence resources, and by taking of fish and wildlife in a manner inconsistent with recognized principles of fish and wildlife management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in order to fulfill the policies and purposes of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] and as a matter of equity, it is necessary for the Congress to invoke its constitutional authority over Native affairs and its constitutional authority under the property clause and the commerce clause to protect and provide the opportunity for continued subsistence uses on the public lands by Native and non-Native rural residents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the national interest in the proper regulation, protection, and conservation of fish and wildlife on the public lands in Alaska and the continuation of the opportunity for a subsistence way of life by residents of rural Alaska require that an administrative structure be established for the purpose of enabling rural residents who have personal knowledge of local conditions and requirements to have a meaningful role in the management of fish and wildlife and of subsistence uses on the public lands in Alaska.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress finds and declares further that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subsequent to December 2, 1980, the subsistence law of the State of Alaska (AS 16.05) accomplished the goals of Congress and requirements of this Act in providing subsistence use opportunities for rural residents of Alaska, both Alaska Native and non-Alaska Native;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Alaska subsistence law was challenged in Alaska courts, and the rural preference requirement in the law was found in 1989 by the Alaska Supreme Court in McDowell v. State of Alaska (785 P.2d 1, 1989) to violate the Alaska Constitution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) since that time, repeated attempts to restore the validity of the State law through an amendment to the Alaska Constitution have failed, and the people of Alaska have not been given the opportunity to vote on such an amendment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in accordance with this subchapter, the Secretary of the Interior is required to manage fish and wildlife for subsistence uses on all public lands in Alaska because of the failure of State law to provide a rural preference;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined in 1995 in State of Alaska v. Babbitt (73 F.3d 698) that the subsistence priority required on public lands under section 3114 of this title applies to navigable waters in which the United States has reserved water rights as identified by the Secretary of the Interior;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) management of fish and wildlife resources by State governments has proven successful in all 50 States, including Alaska, and the State of Alaska should have the opportunity to continue to manage such resources on all lands, including public lands, in Alaska in accordance with this Act, as amended; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) it is necessary to amend portions of this Act to restore the original intent of Congress to protect and provide for the continued opportunity for subsistence uses on public lands for Alaska Native and non-Alaska Native rural residents through the management of the State of Alaska.</p>
