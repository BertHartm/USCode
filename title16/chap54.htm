<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) studies by the Department of Agriculture indicate that billions of tons of soil are eroded annually from non-Federal lands in the United States, much of which represents soil eroded from cropland;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) nearly one-half of the four hundred and thirteen million acres of cropland have soils with moderate, high, or very high risk of damage by sheet and rill erosion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the severity of erosion-related problems varies widely from one geographic area to the next;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) some of the most productive agricultural areas of the United States are also those having the most serious and chronic erosion-related problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) solutions to such chronic erosion-related problems should be designed to address the local social, economic, environmental, and other conditions unique to the area involved to ensure that the goals and policies of the Federal Government are effectively integrated with the concerns of the local community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) certain range and pasturelands in the United States are producing less than their potential and therefore their productive capacity could be substantially improved by application of intensified range and pasture management practices; the protection of these lands is essential to controlling erosion, improving ecological conditions, enhancing wildlife and riparian habitats, improving water quality and yield, and meeting the need to produce food and fiber in a manner that is more energy efficient; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1745 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) there is a need for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reducing seepage from on-farm and off-farm irrigation ditches and conveyance systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) improving water conservation and utilization; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to provide technical and financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall establish a program for the conservation of soil, water, and related resources in special areas designated pursuant to section 3413 of this title (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as &ldquo;designated special areas&rdquo;) by providing technical and financial assistance to owners and operators or groups of owners and operators of farm, ranch, and certain other lands at their request. Such assistance with respect to State, county, and other public land shall be limited to those lands that are an integral part of a private farm operating unit and under the control of the private landowner or operator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contracting authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To carry out the program established under this subchapter, the Secretary may enter into contracts with owners and operators of farm, ranch, or other land in a designated special area having such control over the land as the Secretary deems necessary. Contracts may be entered into with respect to land in a designated special area which is not farm or ranch land only if the erosion-related problems of such land are so severe as to make such contracts with respect to such land necessary for the effective protection of farm or ranch land in that designated special area. Contracts under this subchapter shall be designed to provide assistance to the owners or operators of such farm, ranch, or other land to make voluntary changes in their cropping systems which are needed to conserve or protect the soil, water, and related resources of such lands, and to carry out the soil and water conservation practices and measures needed under such changed systems and uses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conservation plan as precondition for contract; preparation, submission, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis for such contracts shall be a conservation plan approved by the Secretary and the soil and water conservation district in which the land on which the plan is to be carried out is situated. The Secretary shall provide to the landowner or operator, upon request, such technical assistance as may be needed to prepare and submit to the Secretary a conservation plan that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) incorporates such soil and other conservation practices and measures as may be determined to be practicable to protect such land from erosion or water-related problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) outlines a schedule for the implementation of changes in cropping systems or use of land or of water and of conservation practices and measures proposed to be carried out on the farm, ranch, or other land during the contract period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is designed to take into account the local social, economic, and environmental conditions, which will help solve the particular erosion or water-related problems of the designated area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may allow for such varying levels of conservation application as are appropriate to address the problems and may be developed to cover all or part of a farm, ranch, or other land as determined to be necessary to solve the conservation problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) may include practices and measures for enhancing fish and wildlife and recreation resources and for reducing or controlling agricultural-related pollution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) identifies those conservation practices and measures, including planned grazing systems, needed to improve vegetative conditions, reduce erosion, and conserve water on range and pasturelands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contract requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The landowner or operator, in any contract entered into under this subchapter, shall agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to carry out the plan for the owner's or operator's farm, ranch, or other land substantially in accordance with the schedule outlined therein unless any requirement thereof is waived or modified by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (f) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to forfeit further payments under the contract and refund to the United States all payments received thereunder, including interest, upon violation by the owner or operator of the contract at any stage during the time the owner or operator has control of the land if the Secretary, after considering the recommendations of the soil and water conservation district board for the district in which the lands are located, determines that such violation is of such a nature as to warrant termination of the contract, or to make refunds, including interest, or accept such payment adjustments as the Secretary may deem appropriate if the Secretary determines that the violation by the owner or operator does not warrant termination of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) not to adopt any practice or measure specified by the Secretary in the contract which would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) upon transfer, during the contract period, of the rights or interests of the owner or operator in the farm, ranch, or other land on which the plan is to be carried out, to forfeit all rights to further payments under the contract and refund to the United States all payments received thereunder, including interest, unless the transferee of any such land agrees with the Secretary to assume all obligations of the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Cost sharing under contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In return for such agreement by the landowner or operator, the Secretary shall agree to share the cost of carrying out those conservation practices and measures set forth in the contract for which the Secretary determines that cost sharing is appropriate and in the public interest. <!-- PDFPage:1746 -->The portion of the costs to be shared shall be that part which the Secretary determines is necessary and appropriate to effectuate the implementation, and, if applicable, the maintenance of the conservation practices and measures under the contract, including the cost of labor. In determining the share of costs to be borne by the Federal Government, the Secretary shall take into consideration the particular social, economic, and environmental conditions of the geographic area involved and the degree of conservation to be achieved. The Secretary shall determine the maximum amount of cost-share assistance that may be provided to any single recipient. If adjustments from cultivated crops to permanent vegetative cover or changes in crop varieties are undertaken as a conservation practice or measure under the contract, cost-share assistance may be provided under such contract with regard to the income lost as a result of such adjustments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination, modification, etc., of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may terminate any contract with a landowner or operator by mutual agreement with the owner or operator if the Secretary determines that such termination would be in the public interest. The Secretary may agree to such modification of contracts previously entered into as the Secretary may determine to be desirable to carry out the purposes of the program or facilitate the practical administration thereof or to accomplish equitable treatment with respect to similar conservation or other programs administered by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Additional contracting authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may also enter into contracts with landowners or operators for the purpose of maintaining any conservation practice or measure established under this subchapter or other conservation practice or measure which has been adequately established, and to provide necessary assistance to retain the practice or measure on the land. The provisions and administration of such contracts shall be in accordance with the requirements set forth in subsections (b) through (f) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of erosion-related or water management-related problems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program established under this subchapter shall be directed toward identifying and correcting such erosion-related or water management-related problems as may exist within each designated special area. Assistance under this subchapter may be provided to any geographic area of the United States only if such area is first designated by the Secretary as having severe and chronic erosion-related or water management-related problems.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Formulation and implementation; purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture (hereafter referred to in this subchapter as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may formulate and implement a program for furthering the conservation of soil, water, and related resources through annual grants to local units of government through State soil conservation agencies. Such grants shall be for noncapital expenditures in furtherance of local and State conservation objectives specified in section 3433 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Technical and financial assistance programs augmented</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such grants shall be made to augment rather than to replace other technical and financial assistance programs of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A local unit of government may be eligible for a grant under subsection (a) of this section if it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has in effect a current long-range program which the State soil conservation agency determines is adequate to meet local and State laws and objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has in effect a current annual work plan which is consistent with the long-range program in paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) certifies to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee at the State level that it has arranged for equal matching funds or in-kind services to the local unit from regional, State, local, or private sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of matching funds for national objectives in program or plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary determines that a component of the long-range program or annual work plan involves primarily a national rather than a local or State objective, the State or local matching funds required for the national component of the long-range program or annual plan need not exceed 25 per centum of the total funds required to accomplish the national objective. The Secretary, by regulation, shall define those objectives which are national in scope.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Agriculture may enter into contracts to provide financial assistance in the form of payments to owners and operators of cropland located in counties where the soil normally freezes to a depth of at least four inches annually who remove such land from agricultural production for a period not to exceed one year for the purpose of installing enduring conservation measures which involve excavation of the soil. The payments under such contracts shall be in such amounts as determined by the Secretary to be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter but shall not exceed an amount equal to the number of acres of cropland removed from agricultural production for such <!-- PDFPage:1752 -->purpose multiplied by 50 per centum of the typical annual rent, as determined by the Secretary, paid for similar land in the county. Financial assistance may not be provided under this section with respect to any conservation measure without the approval of the soil and water conservation district board for the district in which the land is located, and may not, in the aggregate, be provided in any year with respect to more than one-half of 1 per centum of the cropland in any county.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, such sums to remain available until expended.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3472. Conservation tillage; Congressional findings, etc.</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) domestic and international demand for agricultural products from the United States is great and is expected to significantly increase over the next twenty years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the ability of the United States to provide agricultural products to meet that demand is seriously impaired by the annual loss of five billion tons of soil due to wind and water erosion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the battle against soil erosion is being lost despite the annual expenditure of millions of dollars by the Federal Government on research, technical assistance, and conservation incentives to control soil erosion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) conservation tillage practices are estimated to reduce soil erosion by 50 to 90 per centum over conventional farming practices; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) conservation tillage may result in better yields, greater land use flexibility, decreased fuel use, decreased labor and equipment costs, increased retention of soil moisture, and more productive land than conventional farming practices and may be adaptable to a broad range of soil types and slopes throughout the country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture should, and is hereby urged and requested to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) direct the attention of our Nation's farmers to the costs and benefits of conservation tillage as a means of controlling soil erosion and improving profitability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conduct a program of research designed to resolve any unanswered questions regarding the advantages and disadvantages of conservation tillage over other soil conservation practices.</p>
