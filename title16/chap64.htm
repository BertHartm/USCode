<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the maintenance of healthy populations of migratory birds in North America is dependent on the protection, restoration, and management of wetland ecosystems and other habitats in Canada, as well as in the United States and Mexico;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) wetland ecosystems provide essential and significant habitat for fish, shellfish, and other wildlife of commercial, recreational, scientific, and aesthetic values;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) almost 35 per centum of all rare, threatened, and endangered species of animals are dependent on wetland ecosystems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) wetland ecosystems provide substantial flood and storm control values and can obviate <!-- PDFPage:2125 -->the need for expensive manmade control measures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) wetland ecosystems make a significant contribution to water availability and quality, recharging ground water, filtering surface runoff, and providing waste treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) wetland ecosystems provide aquatic areas important for recreational and aesthetic purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) more than 50 per centum of the original wetlands in the United States alone have been lost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) wetlands destruction, loss of nesting cover, and degradation of migration and wintering habitat have contributed to long-term downward trends in populations of migratory bird species such as pintails, American bitterns, and black ducks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the migratory bird treaty obligations of the United States with Canada, Mexico, and other countries require protection of wetlands that are used by migratory birds for breeding, wintering, or migration and are needed to achieve and to maintain optimum population levels, distributions, and patterns of migration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the 1988 amendments to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980 require the Secretary of the Interior to identify conservation measures to assure that nongame migratory bird species do not reach the point at which measures of the Endangered Species Act [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] are necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) protection of migratory birds and their habitats requires long-term planning and the close cooperation and coordination of management activities by Canada, Mexico, and the United States within the framework of the 1916 and 1936 Migratory Bird Conventions and the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, signed in 1986 by the Minister of Environment for Canada and the Secretary of the Interior for the United States, provides a framework for maintaining and restoring an adequate habitat base to ensure perpetuation of populations of North American waterfowl and other migratory bird species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) a tripartite agreement signed in March 1988, by the Director General for Ecological Conservation of Natural Resources of Mexico, the Director of the Canadian Wildlife Service, and the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, provides for expanded cooperative efforts in Mexico to conserve wetlands for migratory birds that spend the winter there;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the long-term conservation of migratory birds and habitat for these species will require the coordinated action of governments, private organizations, landowners, and other citizens; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) the treaty obligations of the United States under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as waterfowl habitat requires promotion of conservation and wise use of wetlands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are to encourage partnership among public agencies and other interests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to protect, enhance, restore, and manage an appropriate distribution and diversity of wetland ecosystems and other habitats for migratory birds and other fish and wildlife in North America;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to maintain current or improved distributions of migratory bird populations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to sustain an abundance of waterfowl and other migratory birds consistent with the goals of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan and the international obligations contained in the migratory bird treaties and conventions and other agreements with Canada, Mexico, and other countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Council shall submit to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission by January 1 of each year, a description, including estimated costs, of the wetlands conservation projects which the Council has considered under subsection (a) of this section and which it recommends, in order of priority, that the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission approve for Federal funding under this chapter and section 669b(b) of this title. Solely for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), recommendations by the Council for carrying out wetlands conservation projects under section 4405(a) of this title shall be considered Federal actions requiring the preparation of environmental assessments or, where appropriate, environmental impact statements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such percentage of that sum (but at least 50 per centum and not more than 70 per centum thereof) as is considered appropriate by the Secretary, which can be matched with non-Federal moneys in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, less such amount (but not more than 4 per centum of such percentage) considered necessary by the Secretary to defray the costs of administering this chapter during such fiscal year, shall be allocated by the Secretary to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects in Canada and Mexico in accordance with section 4405(b) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the remainder of such sum after paragraph (1) is applied (but at least 30 per centum and not more than 50 per centum thereof), which can be matched with non-Federal moneys in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, shall be allocated by the Secretary to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects in the United States in accordance with section 4405(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Federal contribution for projects; non-Federal share</h4>

The non-Federal share of the United States contribution to the costs of such projects may not be derived from Federal grant programs. In the case of a project carried out in Mexico, the non-Federal share of the United States contribution to the costs of the project may include cash contributions from non-United States sources that are used to pay costs of the project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Partial payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may from time to time make payments to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects as such projects progress, but such payments, including previous payments, if any, shall not be more than the Federal pro rata share of any such project in conformity with subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may enter into agreements to make payments on an initial portion of an approved wetlands conservation project and to agree to make payments on the remaining Federal share of the costs of such project from subsequent allocations if and when they become available.
