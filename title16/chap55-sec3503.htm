<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System, which shall consist of those undeveloped coastal barriers and other areas located on the coasts of the United States that are identified and generally depicted on the maps on file with the Secretary entitled &ldquo;Coastal Barrier Resources System&rdquo;, dated October 24, 1990, as those maps may be modified, revised, or corrected under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subsection (f)(3) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 4 of the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3503 note; Public Law 101&ndash;591); or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">At least once every 5 years, the Secretary shall review the maps referred to in subsection (a) of this section and shall make, in consultation with the appropriate State, local, and Federal officials, such minor and technical modi<!-- PDFPage:2150 -->fications to the boundaries of System units as are necessary solely to reflect changes that have occurred in the size or location of any System unit as a result of natural forces.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additions to System</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may add a parcel of real property to the System, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the owner of the parcel requests, in writing, that the Secretary add the parcel to the System; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the parcel is an undeveloped coastal barrier.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Maps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) keep a map showing the location of each boundary modification made under subsection (c) of this section and of each parcel of real property added to the System under subsection (d) or (e) of this section on file and available for public inspection in the Office of the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and in such other offices of the Service as the Director considers appropriate;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Guidelines for certain recommendations and determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making any recommendation to the Congress regarding the addition of any area to the System or in determining whether, at the time of the inclusion of a System unit within the System, a coastal barrier is undeveloped, the Secretary shall consider whether within the area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the density of development is less than 1 structure per 5 acres of land above mean high tide; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there is existing infrastructure consisting of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a road, with a reinforced road bed, to each lot or building site in the area;</p>
