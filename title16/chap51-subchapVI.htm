<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Secretary is authorized, consistent with other applicable law in order to carry out the purposes of this Act, to acquire by purchase, donation, exchange, or otherwise any lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit other than National Forest Wilderness.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Lands located within the boundaries of a conservation system unit which are owned by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State or a political subdivision of the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a Native Corporation or Native Group which has Natives as a majority of its stockholders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the actual occupant of a tract, title to the surface estate of which was on, before, or after December 2, 1980, conveyed to such occupant pursuant to section 1613(c)(1) and (h)(5) of title 43, unless the Secretary determines that the tract is no longer occupied for the purpose described in section 1613(c)(1) or (h)(5) of title 43 for which the tract was conveyed and that activities on the tract are or will be detrimental to the purposes of the unit in which the tract is located; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a spouse or lineal descendant of the actual occupant of a tract described in subparagraph (C), unless the Secretary determines that activities on the tract are or will be detrimental to the purposes of the unit in which the tract is located&mdash;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">may not be acquired by the Secretary without the consent of the owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Lands located within the boundaries of a conservation system unit (other than National Forest Wilderness) which are owned by persons or entities other than those described in subsection (b) of this section shall not be acquired by the Secretary without the consent of the owner unless prior to final judgment on the value of the acquired land, the owner, after being offered appropriate land of similar characteristics and like value (if such land is available from public lands located outside the boundaries of any conservation system unit), chooses not to accept <!-- PDFPage:2039 -->the exchange. In identifying public lands for exchange pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Alaska Land Use Council.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Improved property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No improved property shall be acquired under subsection (a) of this section without the consent of the owner unless the Secretary first determines that such acquisition is necessary to the fulfillment of the purposes of this Act or to the fulfillment of the purposes for which the concerned conservation system unit was established or expanded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Retained rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner of an improved property on the date of its acquisition, as a condition of such acquisition, may retain for himself, his heirs and assigns, a right of use and occupance of the improved property for noncommercial residential or recreational purposes, as the case may be, for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years, or in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of his spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Unless the property is wholly or partially donated, the Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the owner's interest in the property on the date of its acquisition, less the fair market value on that date of the right retained by the owner. A right retained by the owner pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his determination that such right is being exercised in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this Act, and it shall terminate by operation of law upon notification by the Secretary to the holder of the right of such determination and tendering to him the amount equal to the fair market value of that portion which remains unexpired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Improved property&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;improved property&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a detached single family dwelling, the construction of which was begun before January 1, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;), together with the land on which the dwelling is situated to the extent that such land&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is in the same ownership as the dwelling or is Federal land on which entry was legal and proper, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is designated by the Secretary to be necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures necessary to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) property developed for noncommercial recreational uses, together with any structures accessory thereto which were so used on or before January 1, 1980, to the extent that entry onto such property was legal and proper.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining when and to what extent a property is to be considered an &ldquo;improved property&rdquo;, the Secretary shall take into consideration the manner of use of such buildings and lands prior to January 1, 1980, and shall designate such lands as are reasonably necessary for the continued enjoyment of the property in the same manner and to the same extent as existed before such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Consideration of hardship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by the owner of any property within a conservation system unit to sell such property, if such owner notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership is causing, or would result in, undue hardship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Exchange authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in acquiring lands for the purposes of this Act, the Secretary is authorized to exchange lands (including lands within conservation system units and within the National Forest System) or interests therein (including Native selection rights) with the corporations organized by the Native Groups, Village Corporations, Regional Corporations, and the Urban Corporations, and other municipalities and corporations or individuals, the State (acting free of the restrictions of section 6(i) of the Alaska Statehood Act), or any Federal agency. Exchanges shall be on the basis of equal value, and either party to the exchange may pay or accept cash in order to equalize the value of the property exchanged, except that if the parties agree to an exchange and the Secretary determines it is in the public interest, such exchanges may be made for other than equal value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this Act or any other provision of law shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to convey, by exchange or otherwise, lands or interest in lands within the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (other than land validly selected prior to July 28, 1987), without prior approval by Act of Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Donation or exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to acquire by donation or exchange, lands (A) which are contiguous to any conservation system unit established or expanded by this Act, and (B) which are owned or validly selected by the State of Alaska.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Improved property on National Park System lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On public lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System created or enlarged by this Act, cabins or other structures existing prior to December 18, 1973, may be occupied and used by the claimant to these structures pursuant to a renewable, nontransferable permit. Such use and occupancy shall be for terms of five years each: <em>Provided</em>, That the claimant of the structure by application:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale or other documentation, proof of possessory interest or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Agrees to vacate the cabin and to remove all personal property from the cabin or structure upon expiration of the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Acknowledges in the permit that the applicant has no interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On public lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System created or enlarged by this Act, cabins or other structures, the occupancy or use of which commenced between December 18, 1973, and December 1, 1978, may be used and occupied by the claimant of such structure pursuant to a nontransferable, nonrenewable permit. Such use and occupancy shall be for a maximum term of one year: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the claimant, by application:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale, or other documentation, proof of possessory interest or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Agrees to vacate the cabin or structure and to remove all personal property from it upon expiration of the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Acknowledges in the permit that the applicant has no legal interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may, on a case by case basis, subject to reasonable regulations, extend such permit term beyond one year for such reasons as the Secretary deems equitable and just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Cabins or other structure not under permit as specified herein shall be used only for official government business: <em>Provided however</em>, That during emergencies involving the safety of human life or where designated for public use by the Secretary, these cabins may be used by the general public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may issue a permit under such conditions as he may prescribe for the temporary use, occupancy, construction and maintenance of new cabins or other structures if he determines that the use is necessary to reasonably accommodate subsistence uses or is otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Improved property on other units or areas established or expanded by this Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following conditions shall apply regarding the construction, use and occupancy of cabins and related structures on Federal lands within conservation system units or areas not provided for in subsection (a) of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The construction of new cabins is prohibited except as may be authorized pursuant to a nontransferable, five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall only be issued upon a determination that the proposed use, construction, and maintenance of a cabin is compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established and that the use of the cabin is either directly related to the administration of the unit or area or is necessary to provide for a continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed within the unit or area where the permit applicant has no reasonable alternative site for constructing a cabin. No special use permit shall be issued to authorize the construction of a cabin for private recreational use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Traditional and customary uses of existing cabins and related structures on Federal lands within a unit or area may be allowed to continue in accordance with a nontransferable, renewable five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall be issued only upon a determination that the traditional and customary uses are compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established. No special use permits shall be issued to authorize the use of an existing cabin constructed for private recreational use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) No special use permit shall be issued under paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection unless the permit applicant:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the case of existing cabins or structures, reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale or other documentation, proof of possessory interests or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2041 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the existing or proposed cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Agrees to vacate the cabin or structure and to remove within a reasonable time period established by the Secretary, all personal property from it upon nonrenewal or revocation of the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Acknowledges in the permit application that the applicant has no interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located or will be constructed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States shall retain ownership of all new cabins and related structures on Federal lands within a unit or area specified in this subsection, and no proprietary rights or privileges shall be conveyed through the issuance of the special use permit authorized by paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection. Cabins or other structures not under permit shall be used only for official Government business: <em>Provided, however</em>, That during emergencies involving the safety of human life or where designated for public use by the unit or area manager, such cabins may be used by the general public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Permits to be renewed for life of claimant and immediate family</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever issuance of a nontransferable renewable five-year special use permit is authorized by subsections (a) or (b) of this section, said permit shall be renewed every five years until the death of the last immediate family member of the claimant residing in the cabin or structure, or unless the Secretary has revoked the special use permit in accordance with the criteria established in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary, after notice and hearing, may revoke a permit provided for in this section if he determines, on the basis of substantial evidence in the administrative record as a whole, that the use under the permit is causing or may cause significant detriment to the principal purposes for which the unit was established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Existing cabin leases or permits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this Act shall preclude the renewal or continuation of valid leases or permits in effect on December 2, 1980, for cabins, homesites, or similar structures on Federal lands. Unless the Secretary, or in the case of national forest lands, the Secretary of Agriculture, issues specific findings following notice and an opportunity for the lease-holder or permittee to respond, that renewal or continuation of such valid permit or lease constitutes a direct threat to or a significant impairment to the purposes for which a conservation system unit was established (in the case of a structure located within a conservation system unit) or the public domain or national forest (in case of a structure located outside conservation system units), he shall renew such valid leases or permits upon their expiration in accordance with the provisions of the original lease or permit, subject to such reasonable regulations as he may prescribe. Subject to the provisions of the original lease or permit, nothing in this Act or subsection shall necessarily preclude the appropriate Secretary from transferring such a lease or permit to another person at the election or death of the original permittee or leasee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Aquaculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In accordance with the goal of restoring and maintaining fish production in the State of Alaska to optimum sustained yield levels and in a manner which adequately assures protection, preservation, enhancement, and rehabilitation of the wilderness resource, the Secretary of Agriculture may permit fishery research, management, enhancement, and rehabilitation activities within national forest wilderness and national forest wilderness study areas designated by this Act. Subject to reasonable regulations, permanent improvements and facilities such as fishways, fish weirs, fish ladders, fish hatcheries, spawning channels, stream clearance, egg planting, and other accepted means of maintaining, enhancing, and rehabilitating fish stocks may be permitted by the Secretary to achieve this objective. Any fish hatchery, fishpass or other aquaculture facility authorized for any such area shall be constructed, managed, and operated in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on the wilderness character of the area. Developments for any such activities shall involve those facilities essential to these operations and shall be constructed in such rustic manner as to blend into the natural character of the area. Reasonable access solely for the purposes of this subsection, including temporary use of motorized equipment, shall be permitted in furtherance of research, management, rehabilitation and enhancement activities subject to reasonable regulations as the Secretary deems desirable to maintain the wilderness character, water quality, and fish and wildlife values of the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Existing cabins</h4>
