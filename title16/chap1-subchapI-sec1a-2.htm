<h4 class="paragraph-head">(b) Recreation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">provide recreation facilities, equipment, and services for use by employees and their families located at isolated areas of the national park system;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(c) Advisory committees; compensation and travel expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">appoint and establish such advisory committees in regard to the functions of the National Park Service as he may deem advisable, members of which shall receive no compensation for their services as such but who shall be allowed necessary travel expenses as authorized by section 5703 of title 5;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(d) Park equipment purchases</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">enter into contracts which provide for the sale or lease to persons, States, or their political subdivisions, of services, resources, or water available within an area of the national park system, as long as such activity does not jeopardize or unduly interfere with the primary natural or historic resource of the area involved, if such person, State, or its political subdivision&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">sell at fair market value without regard to the requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.], products and services produced in the conduct of living exhibits and interpretive demonstrations in areas of the national park system, to enter into contracts including cooperative arrangements with respect to such living exhibits and interpretive demonstrations, and to credit the proceeds therefrom to the appropriation bearing the cost of such exhibits and demonstrations;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1a-2_1_target" name="1a-2_1">1</a></sup> Sixty percent of the fees paid by permittees for the privilege of entering into Glacier Bay for the period beginning on the first full fiscal year following November 12, 1996, shall be deposited into a special account and that such funds shall be available&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(2) to conduct investigations to quantify any effect of permittees&rsquo; activity on wildlife and other natural resource values of Glacier Bay National Park. The investigations provided for in this subsection shall be designed to provide information of value to the Secretary, in determining any appropriate limitations on permittees&rsquo; activity in Glacier Bay. The Secretary may not impose any additional permittee operating conditions in the areas of air, water, and oil pollution beyond those determined and enforced by other appropriate agencies. When competitively awarding permits to enter Glacier Bay, the Secretary may take into account the relative impact particular permittees will have on park values and resources, provided that no operating conditions or limitations relating to noise abatement shall be imposed unless the Secretary determines, based on the weight of the evidence from all available studies including verifiable scientific information from the investigations provided for in this subsection, that such limitations or conditions are necessary to protect park values and resources.
