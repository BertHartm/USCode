<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a voluntary public access program under which States and tribal governments may apply for grants to encourage owners and operators of privately-held farm, ranch, and forest land to voluntarily make that land available for access by the public for wildlife-dependent recreation, including hunting or fishing under programs administered by the States and tribal governments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In submitting applications for a grant under the program, a State or tribal government shall describe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the benefits that the State or tribal government intends to achieve by encouraging public access to private farm and ranch land for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) hunting and fishing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the maximum extent practicable, other recreational purposes; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the methods that will be used to achieve those benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving applications and awarding grants under the program, the Secretary shall give priority to States and tribal governments that propose&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to maximize participation by offering a program the terms of which are likely to meet with widespread acceptance among landowners;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure that land enrolled under the State or tribal government program has appropriate wildlife habitat;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to strengthen wildlife habitat improvement efforts on land enrolled in a special conservation reserve enhancement program described in section 3834(f)(4) of this title by providing incentives to increase public hunting and other recreational access on that land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to use additional Federal, State, tribal government, or private resources in carrying out the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to make available to the public the location of land enrolled.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Relationship to other laws</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of inconsistent opening dates for migratory bird hunting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reduce by 25 percent the amount of a grant otherwise determined for a State under the program if the opening dates for migratory bird hunting in the State are not consistent for residents and non-residents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall promulgate such regulations as are necessary to carry out this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Funding</h4>
