Each Preservation Officer may, in order to be considered qualified, satisfactorily complete an appropriate training program established by the Secretary under section 470a(h) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Agency programs and projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consistent with the agency's missions and mandates, all Federal agencies shall carry out agency programs and projects (including those under which any Federal assistance is provided or any Federal license, permit, or other approval is required) in accordance with the purposes of this subchapter and, give consideration to programs and projects which will further the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Planning and actions to minimize harm to National Historic Landmarks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the approval of any Federal undertaking which may directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark, the head of the responsible Federal agency shall, to the maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark, and shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Costs of preservation as eligible project costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal agency may include the costs of preservation activities of such agency under this subchapter as eligible project costs in all undertakings of such agency or assisted by such agency. The eligible project costs may also include amounts paid by a Federal agency to any State to be used in carrying out such preservation responsibilities of the Federal agency under this subchapter, and reasonable costs may be charged to Federal licensees and permittees as a condition to the issuance of such license or permit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Annual preservation awards program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish an annual preservation awards program under which he may make monetary awards in amounts of not to exceed $1,000 and provide citations for special achievement to officers and employees of Federal, State, and certified local governments in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the preservation of historic resources. Such program may include the issuance of annual awards by the President of the United States to any citizen of the United States recommended for such award by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Environmental impact statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to require the preparation of an environmental impact statement where such a statement would not otherwise be required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.], and nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to provide any exemption from any requirement respecting the preparation of such a statement under such Act.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Assistance for adversely affected historic property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal agency shall ensure that the agency will not grant a loan, loan guarantee, permit, license, or other assistance to an applicant who, with intent to avoid the requirements of section 470f of this title, has intentionally significantly adversely affected a historic property to which the grant would relate, or having legal power to prevent it, allowed such significant adverse effect to occur, unless the agency, after consultation with the Council, determines that circumstances justify granting such assistance despite the adverse effect created or permitted by the applicant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Documentation of decisions respecting undertakings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any undertaking subject to section 470f of this title which adversely affects any property included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register, and for which a Federal agency has not entered into an agreement with the Council, the head of such agency shall document any decision made pursuant to section 470f of this title.
