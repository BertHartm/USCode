<p class="statutory-body">Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have committed an act prohibited by section 773e of this title shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $200,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary, or his designee, by written notice.

In assessing such penalty, the Secretary may also consider any information provided by the violator relating to the ability of the violator to pay if the information is provided to the Secretary at least 30 days prior to an administrative hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review thereof in the appropriate court of the United States by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 30 days from the date of such order and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the Secretary and the Attorney General. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such penalty imposed, in accordance with rules prescribed pursuant to section 2112 of title 28.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recovery of assessed penalties by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of <!-- PDFPage:1222 -->the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) deny such permit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) impose additional conditions and restrictions on any permit issued to or applied for by such vessel or person under this subchapter and, with respect to any foreign fishing vessel, on the approved application of the foreign nation involved and on any permit issued under that application.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In imposing a sanction under this subsection, the Secretary shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts for which the sanction is imposed; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transfers of ownership</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No sanction shall be imposed under this subsection unless there has been prior opportunity for a hearing on the facts underlying the violation for which the sanction is imposed either in conjunction with a civil penalty proceeding under this section or otherwise.</p>
