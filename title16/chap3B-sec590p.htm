<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The obligations incurred for the purpose of carrying out, for any calendar year, the provisions of sections 590g, 590h, 590i, and 590j to 590n of this title shall not exceed $500,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contracts with landowners in Great Plains area; purpose; timeliness; land use plans; costs; termination; wheat acreage; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary is authorized, within the amounts of such appropriations as may be provided therefor, to enter into contracts of not to exceed ten years with owners and operators of land in the Great Plains area having such control as the Secretary determines to be needed of the farms, ranches, or other lands covered thereby; but such contracts shall be entered into with respect to lands, other than farms or ranches, only where erosion is so serious as to make such contracts necessary for the protection of farm or ranch lands. Such contracts shall be designed to assist farm, ranch, or other land owners or operators to make, in orderly progression over a period of years, changes in their cropping systems or land uses which are needed to conserve, develop, protect, and utilize the soil and water resources of their farms, ranches, and other lands and to install the soil and water conservation measures and carry out the practices needed under such changed systems and uses. Such contracts may be entered into during the period ending not later than September 30, 2001, with respect to farms, ranches, and other lands in counties in the Great Plains area of the States of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, designated by the Secretary as susceptible to serious wind or water erosion by reason of their soil types, terrain, and climatic, soil, topographic, flood, saline, other natural hazards, and other factors. The landowner or operator shall furnish to the Secretary a plan of farming operations or land use which incorporates such soil and water conservation practices and principles as may be determined by him to be practicable for maximum mitigation of climatic, soil, topographic, flood, saline, and other natural hazards of the area in which such land is located, and which outlines a schedule of proposed changes in cropping systems or land use and of the conservation measures which are to be carried out on the farm, ranch, other land during the contract period to protect the farm, ranch, or other land from erosion and deterioration by natural causes. Such plan may also include practices and measures for (a) enhancing fish and wildlife and recreation resources, (b) promoting the economic use of land, and (c) reducing or controlling agricultural related pollution. Inclusion in the farm plan of these practices shall be the exclusive decision of the land owner or operator. Approved conservation plans of land owners and operators developed in cooperation with the soil and water conservation district in which their lands are situated shall form a basis for contracts. Under the contract the land owner or operator shall agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to effectuate the plan for his farm, ranch, or other land substantially in accordance with the schedule outlined therein unless any requirement thereof is waived or modified by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to forfeit all rights to further payments or grants under the contract and refund to the United States all payments or grants received thereunder upon his violation of the contract at any stage during the time he has control of the land if the Secretary, after considering the recommendations of the soil and water conservation district board, determines that such violation is of such a nature as to warrant termination of the contract, or to make refunds or accept such payment adjustments as the Secretary may deem appropriate if he determines that the violation by the owner or operator does not warrant termination of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) upon transfer of his right and interest in the farm, ranch, or other land during the contract period to forfeit all rights to further payments or grants under the contract and refund to the United States all payments or grants received thereunder unless the transferee of any such land agrees with the Secretary to assume all obligations of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) not to adopt any practice specified by the Secretary in the contract as a practice which would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) to such additional provisions as the Secretary determines are desirable and includes in the contract to effectuate the purposes of the program or to facilitate the practical administration of the program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In return for such agreement by the land-owner or operator the Secretary shall agree to share the cost of carrying out those conservation practices and measures set forth in the contract for which he determines that cost sharing is appropriate and in the public interest. The portion of such cost (including labor) to be shared shall be that part which the Secretary determines is necessary and appropriate to effectuate the physical installation of the conservation practices and measures under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary may terminate any contract with a land owner or operator by mutual agreement with the owner or operator if the Secretary determines that such termination would be in the public interest, and may agree to such modification of contracts previously entered into as he may determine to be desirable to carry out the purposes of the program or facilitate the practical administration thereof or to accomplish equitable treatment <!-- PDFPage:883 -->with respect to other similar conservation, land use, or commodity programs administered by the Secretary;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in applying the provisions of paragraph (6) of section 1340 of title 7, relating to the reduction of storage amount of wheat, any acreage diverted from the production of wheat under the program carried out under this subsection shall be regarded as wheat acreage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Secretary shall utilize the technical services of agencies of the Department of Agriculture in determining the scope and provisions of any plan and the acceptability of the plan for effectuating the purposes of the program. In addition the Secretary shall take into consideration programs of State and local agencies, including soil conservation districts, having for their purposes the objectives of maximum soil and water conservation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) there is hereby authorized to be appropriated, without fiscal year limitations, such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection: <em>Provided</em>, That the total cost of the program (excluding administrative costs) shall not exceed $1,000,000,000, and for any program year payments shall not exceed $50,000,000. The funds made available for the program under this subsection may be expended without regard to the maximum payment limitation and small payment increases required under section 590h(e) of this title, and may be distributed among States without regard to distribution of funds formulas of section 590<em>o</em> of this title. The program authorized under this subsection shall be in addition to, and not in substitution of, other programs in such area authorized by this chapter or any other Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) 1961 agricultural conservation program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall formulate and carry out a special agricultural conservation program for 1961, without regard to provisions which would be applicable to the regular agricultural conservation program, under which, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, conservation payments in amounts determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable shall be made to producers who divert acreage from the production of corn and grain sorghums to an approved conservation use and increase their average acreage devoted in 1959 and 1960 to designated soil conserving crops or practices by an equal amount: <em>Provided, however</em>, That any producer may elect in lieu of such payment to devote such diverted acreage to castor beans, safflower, sunflower, or sesame, if designated by the Secretary. Such special agricultural conservation program shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to keep such diverted acreage free from insects, weeds, and rodents. The acreage eligible for payments in cash or in an equivalent amount in kind under such conservation program shall be an acreage equivalent to 20 per centum of the average acreage on the farm planted to corn and grain sorghums in the crop years 1959 and 1960 or up to twenty acres, whichever is greater. Such payments in cash or in kind at the basic county support rate may be made on an amount of corn and grain sorghums not in excess of 50 per centum of the normal production of the acreage diverted from corn and grain sorghums on the farm based on its average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage. Payments in kind only may be made by the Secretary for the diversion of up to an additional 20 per centum of such corn and grain sorghum acreage. Payments in kind on such additional acreage may be made at the basic county support rate on an amount of corn and grain sorghums not in excess of 60 per centum of the normal production of the acreage diverted from corn and grain sorghums on the farm based on its average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage. The Secretary may make such adjustments in acreage and yields for the 1959 and 1960 crop years as he determines necessary to correct for abnormal factors affecting production, and to give due consideration to tillable acreage, crop rotation practices, type of soil, and topography. The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of any payments to producers in advance of determination of performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out this subsection. Obligations may be incurred in advance of appropriations therefor and the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to advance from its capital funds such sums as may be necessary to pay administrative expenses in connection with such program during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1961, and to pay such costs as may be included in carrying out section 3 of the Act which added this subsection to this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary shall provide by regulations for the sharing of payments under this subsection among producers on the farm on a fair and equitable basis and in keeping with existing contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) 1962 agricultural conservation program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall formulate and carry out a special agricultural conservation program for 1962, without regard to provisions which would be applicable to the regular agricultural conservation program, under which, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, conservation payments in amounts determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable shall be made to producers who divert acreage from the production of corn and grain sorghums, and barley, respectively, to an approved conservation use and increase their average acreage of cropland devoted in 1959 and 1960 to designated soil conservation crops or practices including summer fallow and idle land by an equal amount: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may permit such diverted acreage to be devoted to the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, other annual field crops for which price support is not made available, and flax, when such crops are not in surplus supply and will not be in surplus supply if permitted to be <!-- PDFPage:884 -->grown on the diverted acreage, subject to the condition that payment with respect to diverted acreage devoted to any such crop shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the use of such acreage for the production of such crops, but in no event shall the payment exceed one-half the rate which would otherwise be applicable if such acreage were devoted to conservation uses and no price support shall be made available for the production of any such crop on such diverted acreage. In order to be eligible for a payment a producer (other than a producer of malting barley as described in section 1444b(c)(4) of title 7, or a producer of barley on a summer-fallow farm as described in such section) who participates in the special agricultural conservation program of 1962 for corn and grain sorghums must not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm in excess of the average acreage devoted on the farm to barley in 1959 and 1960, and a producer who participates in the special agricultural conservation program for 1962 for barley must not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm to corn and grain sorghums in excess of the average acreage devoted on the farm to corn and grain sorghums in 1959 and 1960. The excess, if any, of the acreage devoted to barley in 1962 on a summer-fallow farm as described in section 1444b(c)(4) of title 7 over the average acreage devoted to barley on such farm in 1959 and 1960 shall be considered as planted to corn and grain sorghums for the purpose of determining extent of participation and payments under the special agricultural conservation program for 1962 for corn and grain sorghums. Such special agricultural conservation program shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to keep such diverted acreage free from insects, weeds, and rodents. The acreage eligible for payments in cash or in an equivalent amount in kind under such conservation program shall be an acreage equivalent to 20 per centum of the average acreage on the farm planted to corn and grain sorghums, or barley, in the crop years 1959 and 1960 or up to twenty acres, whichever is greater. Such payments in cash or in kind at the basic county support rate for the 1961 crop in effect at the time payment rates for the special feed grain program for 1962 are established, adjusted to reflect any changes between the national support rates for the 1961 and 1962 crops may be made on an amount of the commodity not in excess of 50 per centum of the normal production of the acreage diverted from the commodity on the farm based on its adjusted average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage. Payments in kind only may be made by the Secretary for the diversion of up to an additional 20 per centum of the average acreage on the farm planted to corn and grain sorghums, or barley, in the crop years 1959 and 1960. Payments in kind on such additional acreage may be made at the basic county support rate for the 1961 crop in effect at the time payment rates for the special feed grain program for 1962 are established, adjusted to reflect any changes between the national support rates for the 1961 and 1962 crops on an amount of corn and grain sorghums, or barley, not in excess of 60 per centum of the normal production of the acreage diverted from the commodity on the farm based on its adjusted average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage. The Secretary may make such adjustments in acreage and yields for the 1959 and 1960 crop years as he determines necessary to correct for abnormal factors affecting production, and to give due consideration to tillable acreage, crop rotation practices, type of soil, soil and water conservation measures, and topography. To the extent that a producer proves the actual acreages and yields for the farm for the 1959 and 1960 crop years, such acreages and yields shall be used in making determinations. The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of any payments to producers in advance of determination of performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out this subsection. Obligations may be incurred in advance of appropriations therefor and the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to advance from its capital funds such sums as may be necessary to pay administrative expenses in connection with such program during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1962, and to pay such costs as may be incurred in carrying out section 133 of the Agricultural Act of 1961.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary shall provide by regulations for the sharing of payments under this subsection among producers on the farm on a fair and equitable basis and in keeping with existing contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Changes in cropping systems and land uses; agreements with retired resident landowners; land uses; safeguards; modification of prior agreements; regulations; transfer of funds; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) For the purpose of promoting the conservation and economic use of land and of assisting farmers who because of advanced age, poor health, or other reasons, desire to retire from farming but wish to continue living on their farms, the Secretary, without regard to the foregoing provisions of this chapter, except those relating to the use of the services of State and local committees, is authorized to enter into agreements during the calendar years 1971, 1972, and 1973, to be carried out during such period not to exceed ten years as he may determine, with farm and ranch owners and operators providing for changes in cropping systems and land uses and for practices or measures to be carried out primarily on any lands owned or operated by them and regularly used in the production of crops (including crops such as tame hay, alfalfa, and clovers, which do not require annual tillage, and including lands covered by conservation reserve contracts under subtitle B of the Soil Bank Act) for the purpose of conserving and developing soil, water, forest, wildlife, and recreation resources. Such agreements shall include such terms and conditions as the Secretary may deem desirable to effectuate the purposes of this subsection and may provide for payments, the furnishing of materials and services, and other <!-- PDFPage:885 -->assistance in amounts determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable, in consideration of the obligations undertaken by the farm and ranch owners and operators and the rights acquired by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That any agreements entered into under this section after July 1, 1970, shall prohibit grazing of such acreage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such acreage may be devoted to approved wildlife food plots or fish and wildlife habitat which are established in conformity with standards developed by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary may compensate producers for such practices. The Secretary may also provide for payment in an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate in relation to the benefit to the general public if the producer agrees to permit access, without other compensation, to all or such portion of the farm as the Secretary may prescribe by the general public, for hunting, trapping, fishing, and hiking, subject to applicable State and Federal regulations. The Secretary after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior shall appoint an Advisory Board consisting of citizens knowledgeable in the fields of agriculture and wildlife with whom he may consult on the wildlife practice phase of programs under this subsection, and the Secretary may compensate members of the Board and reimburse them for per diem and traveling expenses. The Secretary shall invite the several States to participate in wildlife phases of programs under this subsection by assisting the Department of Agriculture in developing guidelines for (a) providing technical assistance for wildlife and habitat improvement practices, (b) reviewing applications of farmers for the public land use option and selecting eligible areas based on desirability of wildlife habitat, (c) determining accessibility, (d) evaluating effects on surrounding areas, (e) considering esthetic values, (f) checking compliance by cooperators, and (g) carrying out programs of wildlife stocking and management on the acreage set aside. The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior regarding regulations to govern the administration of those aspects of this subparagraph (B) that pertain to wildlife. Funds are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior for use in assisting the State wildlife agencies to carry out the provisions of this subparagraph and in administering such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No agreement shall be entered into under this subsection covering land with respect to which the ownership has changed in the two year period preceding the first year of the contract period unless (a) the new ownership was acquired by will or succession as a result of the death of the previous owner, (b) the land becomes a part of an existing farm or ranch, or (c) the land is combined with other land as a farming or ranching enterprise which the Secretary determines will effectuate the purposes of the program: <em>Provided</em>, That this provision shall not prohibit the continuation of an agreement by a new owner after an agreement has once been entered into under this subsection. The foregoing provision shall not prevent a producer from placing a farm in the program if the farm was acquired by the producer to replace an eligible farm from which he was displaced because of its acquisition by any Federal, State, or other agency having the right of eminent domain.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the farming opportunities and interests of tenants and sharecroppers, including provision for sharing, on a fair and equitable basis, in payments under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may agree to such modification of agreements previously entered into as he may determine to be desirable to carry out the purposes of this subsection or to facilitate the practical administration of the program carried out pursuant to this subsection. Any agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement with the producer if the Secretary determines that such termination would be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall issue such regulations as he determines necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection. The Secretary may if he determines that such action will contribute to the effective and equitable administration of the program use an advertising-and-bid procedure in determining the lands in any area to be covered by agreements. The total acreage placed under agreements in any county or local community shall be limited to a percentage of the total eligible acreage in such county or local community which the Secretary determines would not adversely affect the economy of the county or local community. In determining such percentage the Secretary shall give appropriate consideration to the productivity of the acreage being retired as compared to the average productivity of eligible acreage in the county or local community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For the purpose of obtaining an increase in the permanent retirement of cropland to noncrop uses the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, transfer funds available for carrying out the program to any other Federal agency or to States or local government agencies for use in rural areas in acquiring cropland for the preservation of open spaces, natural beauty, the development of wildlife or recreational facilities, or the prevention of air or water pollution under terms and conditions consistent with and at costs not greater than those under agreements entered into with producers, provided the Secretary determines that the purpose of the program will be accomplished by such action. The Secretary also is authorized to share the cost with State and local governmental agencies and other Federal agencies in the establishment of practices or uses which will establish, protect, and conserve open spaces, natural beauty, wildlife or recreational resources, or prevent air or water pollution under terms and conditions and at costs consistent with those under agreements entered into with producers, provided the Secretary determines that the purposes of the program will be accomplished by such action. No appropriation shall be made for any agreement under this paragraph (6) involving an estimated total Federal payment in excess of $250,000 unless such agreement has been approved by resolution adopted by the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on <!-- PDFPage:886 -->Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary is authorized to utilize the facilities, services, authorities, and funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation in discharging his functions and responsibilities under this subsection including payment of costs of administration for the program authorized under this subsection: <em>Provided</em>, That after June 30, 1972, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall not make any expenditures for carrying out the purposes of this subsection unless the Corporation has received funds to cover such expenditures from appropriations made to carry out the purposes of this subsection. In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall not during any of the fiscal years ending June 30, 1971, through June 30, 1973, or during the period June 30, 1973, to December 31, 1973, (A) enter into agreements with producers which would require payments to producers in any calendar year under such agreements in excess of $10,000,000 plus any amount by which agreements entered into in prior fiscal years require payments in amounts less than authorized for such years, or (B) enter into agreements with States or local agencies under paragraph (6) which would require payments to such State or local government agencies in any calendar year under such agreements in excess of $10,000,000 plus any amount by which agreements entered into in prior fiscal years require payments in amounts less than authorized for such years. For purposes of applying the foregoing limitations, the annual payment shall be chargeable to the year in which performance is rendered regardless of the year in which it is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Use of Commodity Credit Corporation in producer disbursements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to use the services, facilities, and authorities of Commodity Credit Corporation for the purpose of making disbursements to producers under programs formulated pursuant to section 590h of this title and subsection (e) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That no such disbursements shall be made by Commodity Credit Corporation unless it has received funds to cover the amount thereof from appropriations available for the purpose of carrying out such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) 1963 agricultural conservation program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall formulate and carry out a special agricultural conservation program for 1963, without regard to provisions which would be applicable to the regular agricultural conservation program, under which, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, conservation payments in amounts determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable shall be made to producers who divert acreage from the production of corn, grain sorghums, and barley to an approved conservation use and increase their average acreage of cropland devoted in 1959 and 1960 to designated soil-conserving crops or practices including summer fallow and idle land by an equal amount: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may permit such diverted acreage to be devoted to the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, and flax, when such crops are not in surplus supply and will not be in surplus supply if permitted to be grown on the diverted acreage, subject to the condition that payment with respect to diverted acreage devoted to any such crop shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the use of such acreage for the production of such crops, but in no event shall the payment exceed one-half the rate which would otherwise be applicable if such acreage were devoted to conservation uses and no price support shall be made available for the production of any such crop on such diverted acreage. Such special agricultural conservation program shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to keep such diverted acreage free from erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents. The acreage eligible for payments in cash or in an equivalent amount in kind under such conservation program shall be an acreage equivalent to 20 per centum of the average acreage on the farm planted to corn, grain sorghums, and barley in the crop years 1959 and 1960 or up to twenty-five acres, whichever is greater. Payments in kind only may be made by the Secretary for the diversion of up to an additional 30 per centum of the average acreage on the farm planted to corn, grain sorghums, and barley, in the crop years 1959 and 1960. Payments may be made at the basic county support rate for the 1962 crop in effect at the time payment rates for the special feed grain program for 1963 are established, adjusted to reflect any changes between the national support rates for the 1962 and 1963 crops on an amount of the commodity not in excess of 50 per centum of the normal production of the acreage diverted from the commodity on the farm based on its adjusted average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage. The Secretary may make such adjustments in acreage and yields for the 1959 and 1960 crop years as he determines necessary to correct for abnormal factors affecting production, and to give due consideration to tillable acreage, crop rotation practices, type of soil, soil and water conservation measures, and topography. The Secretary may also make such adjustments in yields as he determines necessary to reflect any increases in yields since the 1959 and 1960 crop years as the result of the adoption or the improvement of an irrigation system if such improvement or adoption of such irrigation system was made prior to the effective date of this sentence but such adjustment in yields shall apply only to payments with respect to acreage diverted pursuant to the requirements of section 1444b(c)(6) of title 7. To the extent that a producer proves the actual acreages and yields for the farm for the 1959 and 1960 crop years, such acreages and yields shall be used in making determinations. The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of any payments to producers in advance of determination of performance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this sub<!-- PDFPage:887 -->section (g)(1), barley shall not be included in the program for a producer of malting barley exempted pursuant to section 1444b(c)(6) of title 7 who participates only with respect to corn and grain sorghums and does not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm to barley in excess of 110 per centum of the average acreage devoted on the farm to barley in 1959 and 1960.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out this subsection. Obligations may be incurred in advance of appropriations therefor and the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to advance from its capital funds such sums as may be necessary to pay administrative expenses in connection with such program during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1963, and to pay such costs as may be incurred in carrying out section 303 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary shall provide by regulations for the sharing of payments under this subsection among producers on the farm on a fair and equitable basis and in keeping with existing contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) 1964 and 1965 feed grain crops; acreage diversion program; maximum reserves; authorization of appropriations; regulations; payments in kind; termination or modification of prior agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) For the 1964 crop and the 1965 crop of feed grains, if the Secretary determines that the total supply of feed grains will, in the absence of an acreage diversion program, likely be excessive, taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices of feed grains and to meet any national emergency, he may formulate and carry out an acreage diversion program for feed grains, without regard to provisions which would be applicable to the regular agricultural conservation program, under which, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, conservation payments in amounts determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable shall be made to producers who divert acreage from the production of feed grains to an approved conservation use and increase their average acreage of cropland devoted in 1959 and 1960 to designated soil-conserving crops or practices including summer fallow and idle land by an equal amount. Payments shall not be made in amounts in excess of 50 per centum of the estimated basic county support rate, including that part of the support price made available through payments in kind, on the normal production of the acreage diverted from the commodity on the farm based on its adjusted average yield per acre. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Secretary may permit such diverted acreage to be devoted to the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, and flax, if he determines that such crops are not in surplus supply and will not be in surplus supply if permitted to be grown on the diverted acreage, subject to the conditions that payment with respect to diverted acreage devoted to any such crop shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the use of such acreage for the production of such crops, but in no event shall the payment exceed one-half the rate which would otherwise be applicable if such acreage were devoted to conservation uses, and no price support shall be made available for the production of any such crop on such diverted acreage. The base period for the purpose of determining the adjusted average yield in the case of payments with respect to the 1964 crop shall be the four-year period 1959&ndash;1962, and in the case of payments with respect to the 1965 crop shall be the five-year period 1959&ndash;1963. The term &ldquo;feed grains&rdquo; means corn, grain sorghums, barley, and, if for any crop the producer so requests for purposes of having acreage devoted to the production of wheat considered as devoted to the production of feed grains, pursuant to the provisions of section 1339c of title 7 the term &ldquo;feed grains&rdquo; shall include oats and rye: <em>Provided</em>, That acreages of corn, grain sorghums, and barley shall not be planted in lieu of acreages of oats and rye: <em>Provided further</em>, That the acreage devoted to the production of wheat shall not be considered as an acreage of feed grains for purposes of establishing the feed grain base acreage for the farm for subsequent crops. Such feed grain diversion program shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to keep such diverted acreage free from erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents. The acreage eligible for participation in the program shall be such acreage (not to exceed 50 per centum of the average acreage on the farm devoted to feed grains in the crop years 1959 and 1960 or twenty-five acres, whichever is greater) as the Secretary determines necessary to achieve the acreage reduction goal for the crop. Payments shall be made in kind. The average acreage of wheat produced on the farm during the crop years 1959, 1960, and 1961, pursuant to the exemption provided in section 335(f) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, prior to its repeal by the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962, in excess of the small farm base acreage for wheat established under section 1335 of title 7, shall be considered as an acreage of feed grains produced in the crop years of 1959 and 1960 for purposes of establishing the feed grain base acreage for the farm, and the rate of payment for diverting such wheat shall be an amount determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable in relation to the rates of payment for diverting feed grains. The Secretary may make such adjustments in acreage and yields as he determines necessary to correct for abnormal factors affecting production, and to give due consideration to tillable acreage, crop-rotation practices, types of soil, soil and water conservation measures, and topography. To the extent that a producer proves the actual acreages and yields for the farm, such acreages and yields shall be used in making determinations.

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) For the 1966 through 1970 crops of feed grains, if the Secretary determines that the total supply of feed grains will, in the absence of an acreage diversion program, likely be excessive, taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices of feed grains and to meet any national emergency, he may formulate and carry out an acreage diversion program for feed grains, without regard to provisions which would be applicable to the regular agricultural conservation program, under which, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, conservation payments shall be made to producers who divert acreage from the production of feed grains to an approved conservation use and increase their average acreage of cropland devoted in 1959 and 1960 to designated soil-conserving crops or practices including summer fallow and idle land by an equal amount. Payments shall be made at such rate or rates as the Secretary determines will provide producers with a fair and reasonable return for the acreage diverted, but not in excess of 50 per centum of the estimated basic county support rate, including the lowest rate of payment-in-kind, on the normal production of the acreage diverted from the commodity on the farm based on the farm projected yield per acre. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Secretary may permit all or any part of such diverted acreage to be devoted to the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, and flaxseed, if he determines that such production of the commodity is needed to provide <!-- PDFPage:889 -->an adequate supply, is not likely to increase the cost of the price support program, and will not adversely affect farm income subject to the condition that payment with respect to diverted acreage devoted to any such crop shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the use of such acreage for the production of such crops, but in no event shall the payment exceed one-half the rate which otherwise would be applicable if such acreage were devoted to conservation uses. The term &ldquo;feed grains&rdquo; means corn, grain sorghums, and, if designated by the Secretary, barley, and if for any crop the producer so requests for purposes of having acreage devoted to the production of wheat considered as devoted to the production of feed grains, pursuant to the provisions of section 1339c of title 7, the term &ldquo;feed grains&rdquo; shall include oats and rye and barley if not designated by the Secretary as provided above: <em>Provided</em>, That acreages of corn, grain sorghums, and, if designated by the Secretary, barley, shall not be planted in lieu of acreages of oats and rye and barley if not designated by the Secretary as provided above: <em>Provided further</em>, That the acreage devoted to the production of wheat shall not be considered as an acreage of feed grains for purposes of establishing the feed grain base acreage for the farm for subsequent crops. Such feed grain diversion programs shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to keep such diverted acreage free from erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents. The acreage eligible for participation in the program shall be such acreage (not to exceed 50 per centum of the average acreage on the farm devoted to feed grains in the crop years 1959 and 1960 or twenty-five acres, whichever is greater) as the Secretary determines necessary to achieve the acreage reduction goal for the crop. Payments shall be made in kind. The acreage of wheat produced on the farm during the crop years 1959, 1960, and 1961, pursuant to the exemption provided in section 335(f) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, prior to its repeal by the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962, in excess of the small farm base acreage for wheat established under section 1335 of title 7, may be taken into consideration in establishing the feed grain base acreage for the farm. The Secretary may make such adjustments in acreage as he determines necessary to correct for abnormal factors affecting production, and to give due consideration to tillable acreage, crop-rotation practices, types of soil, soil and water conservation measures, and topography. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (i)(1), the Secretary may, upon unanimous request of the State committee established pursuant to section 590h(b) of this title, adjust the feed grain bases for farms within any State or county to the extent he determines such adjustment to be necessary in order to establish fair and equitable feed grain bases for farms within such State or county. The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of any payments to producers in advance of determination of performance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, barley shall not be included in the program for a producer of malting barley exempted pursuant to section 1444b(e) of title 7, who participates only with respect to corn and grain sorghums and does not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm to barley in excess of 110 per centum of the average acreage devoted on the farm to barley in 1959 and 1960.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, not to exceed 1 per centum of the estimated total feed grain base for all farms in a State for any year may be reserved from the feed grain bases established for farms in the State for apportionment to farms on which there were no acreages devoted to feed grains in the crop years 1959 and 1960 on the basis of the following factors: Suitability of the land for the production of feed grains, the past experience of the farm operator in the production of feed grains, the extent to which the farm operator is dependent on income from farming for his livelihood, the production of feed grains on other farms owned, operated, or controlled by the farm operator, and such other factors as the Secretary determines should be considered for the purpose of establishing fair and equitable feed grain bases. An acreage equal to the feed grain base so established for each farm shall be deemed to have been devoted to feed grains on the farm in each of the crop years 1959 and 1960 for purposes of this subsection except that producers on such farm shall not be eligible for conservation payments for the first year for which the feed grain base is established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary shall provide by regulations for the sharing of payments under this subsection among producers on the farm on a fair and equitable basis and in keeping with existing contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Payments in kind shall be made through the issuance of negotiable certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation shall redeem for feed grains in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producer in the marketing of such certificates. Feed grains with which Commodity Credit Corporation redeems certificates pursuant to this paragraph shall be valued at not less than the current support price made available through loans and purchases, plus reasonable carrying charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may, by mutual agreement with the producer, terminate or modify any agreement previously entered into pursuant to this subsection if he determines such action necessary because of an emergency created by drought or other disaster, or in order to prevent or alleviate a shortage in the supply of feed grains.</p>
