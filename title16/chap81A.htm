<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Federal Government should charge land use fees for the occupancy and use of Na<!-- PDFPage:2299 -->tional Forest System lands by such organizational camps that, while based on the fair market value of the land in use, also recognize the benefits provided to society by such organizational camps, do not preclude the ability of such organizational camps from utilizing these lands, and permit capital investment in, and maintenance of, camp facilities by such organizational camps or their sponsoring organizations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The estimated per-acre market value of land and buildings in the county where the camp is located, as reported in the most recent Census of Agriculture conducted by the National Agricultural Statistics Service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The land use fee determined under paragraph (1) for an organizational camp shall be adjusted annually by the annual compounded rate of change between the two most recent Censuses of Agriculture.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduction in fees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Type of participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall reduce the land use fee determined under paragraph (1) proportionate to the number of individuals with a disability and children at risk who annually attend the organizational camp.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Type of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After making the reduction required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall reduce the remaining land use fee amount by up to 60 percent, proportionate to the number of persons who annually attend the organizational camp who participate in youth programs through organized and supervised social, citizenship, character-building, or faith-based activities oriented to outdoor-recreation experiences.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Relation to minimum fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The reductions made under this paragraph may not reduce the land use fee for an organizational camp below the minimum land use fee required to be charged under paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special considerations</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Minimum land use fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall charge a minimum land use fee under paragraph (1) that represents, on <!-- PDFPage:2300 -->average, the Secretary's cost annually to administer an organizational camp special use authorization in the National Forest Region in which the organizational camp is located. Notwithstanding paragraph (3) or subsection (d), the minimum land use fee shall not be subject to a reduction or waiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Facility use fee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Percentage of facilities value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an organizational camp uses a Government-owned facility on National Forest System lands pursuant to section 580d of this title, the Secretary shall charge, in addition to the land use fee imposed under subsection (a), a facility use fee equal to 5 percent of the value of the authorized facilities, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
