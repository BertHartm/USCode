<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Consistency of resource plans, permits, contracts, and other instruments with land management plans; revision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Resource plans and permits, contracts, and other instruments for the use and occupancy of National Forest System lands shall be consistent with the land management plans. Those resource plans and permits, contracts, and other such instruments currently in existence shall be revised as soon as practicable to be made consistent with such plans. When land management plans are revised, resource plans and permits, contracts, and other instruments, when necessary, shall be revised as soon as practicable. Any revision in present or future permits, contracts, and other instruments made pursuant to <!-- PDFPage:1526 -->this section shall be subject to valid existing rights.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Effective date of land management plans and revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Land management plans and revisions shall become effective thirty days after completion of public participation and publication of notification by the Secretary as required under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Development of land management plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing land management plans pursuant to this subchapter, the Secretary shall identify lands within the management area which are not suited for timber production, considering physical, economic, and other pertinent factors to the extent feasible, as determined by the Secretary, and shall assure that, except for salvage sales or sales necessitated to protect other multiple-use values, no timber harvesting shall occur on such lands for a period of 10 years. Lands once identified as unsuitable for timber production shall continue to be treated for reforestation purposes, particularly with regard to the protection of other multiple-use values. The Secretary shall review his decision to classify these lands as not suited for timber production at least every 10 years and shall return these lands to timber production whenever he determines that conditions have changed so that they have become suitable for timber production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Program evaluation; process for estimating long-term costs and benefits; summary of data included in annual report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) formulate and implement, as soon as practicable, a process for estimating long-terms&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1604_1_target" name="1604_1">1</a></sup> costs and benefits to support the program evaluation requirements of this subchapter. This process shall include requirements to provide information on a representative sample basis of estimated expenditures associated with the reforestation, timber stand improvement, and sale of timber from the National Forest System, and shall provide a comparison of these expenditures to the return to the Government resulting from the sale of timber; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) include a summary of data and findings resulting from these estimates as a part of the annual report required pursuant to section 1606(c) of this title, including an identification on a representative sample basis of those advertised timber sales made below the estimated expenditures for such timber as determined by the above cost process; and</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Establishment of standards to ensure culmination of mean annual increment of growth; silvicultural practices; salvage harvesting; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) standards to insure that, prior to harvest, stands of trees throughout the National Forest System shall generally have reached the culmination of mean annual increment of growth (calculated on the basis of cubic measurement or other methods of calculation at the discretion of the Secretary): <em>Provided</em>, That these standards shall not preclude the use of sound silvicultural practices, such as thinning or other stand improvement measures: <em>Provided further</em>, That these standards shall not preclude the Secretary from salvage or sanitation harvesting of timber stands which are substantially damaged by fire, windthrow or other catastrophe, or which are in imminent danger from insect or disease attack; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) exceptions to these standards for the harvest of particular species of trees in management units after consideration has been given to the multiple uses of the forest including, but not limited to, recreation, wildlife habitat, and range and after completion of public participation processes utilizing the procedures of subsection (d) of this section.</p>
