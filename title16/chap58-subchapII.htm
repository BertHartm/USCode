If the person's conservation plan requires structures to be constructed, the person shall have until 2 years after the expiration of such contract to comply with the conservation plan, or a longer period of time if the Secretary determines compliance is otherwise technically or economically not feasible, or such longer period is otherwise appropriate, before such person will be subject to program ineligibility with respect to such land under section 3811 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Section 3811 of this title shall not apply to a loan described in section 3811 of this title made before December 23, 1985.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitations on ineligibility for tenants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a tenant is determined to be ineligible for payments and other benefits under section 3811 of this title, the Secretary may limit such ineligibility only to the farm which is the basis for such ineligibility determination if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) No person shall become ineligible under section 3811 of this title for program loans, payments, and benefits as a result of the failure of such person to actively apply a conservation plan, if the Secretary determines that the person has acted in good faith and without an intent to violate this subchapter. A person who meets the requirements of this paragraph shall be allowed a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Secretary, but not to exceed 1 year, during which to implement the measures and practices necessary to be considered to be actively applying the person's conservation plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person whose benefits are reduced in any crop year under this subsection shall continue to be eligible for all of the benefits described in section 3811 of this title for any subsequent crop year if, prior to the beginning of such subsequent crop year, the Secretary determines that such person is actively applying a conservation plan according to the schedule set forth in such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no person shall become ineligible under section 3811 of this title for program loans, payments, and benefits as a result of the failure of such person to actively apply a conservation plan, if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determines that such failure results in a violation of section 3811 of this title that is technical and minor in nature and that such violation has a minimal effect on the erosion control purposes of the conservation plan applicable to the land on which such violation has occurred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determines that such failure is due to circumstances beyond the control of the person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) grants the person a temporary variance from the practices specified in the plan for the purpose of handling a specific problem, including weather, pest, and disease problems.</p>

If the request for a temporary variance under paragraph (4)(C) involves the use of practices or measures to address weather, pest, or disease problems, the Secretary shall make a decision on whether to grant the variance during the 30-day period beginning on the date of receipt of the request. If the Secretary fails to render a decision during the period, the temporary variance shall be considered granted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of measuring the level of residue on a field, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

The Secretary may not revise the person's conservation plan without the concurrence of the person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Technical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, using available resources and consistent with the Secretary's other conservation responsibilities and objectives, provide technical assistance to a person throughout the development, revision, and application of the conservation plan and any conservation system of the person.
