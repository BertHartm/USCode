<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior is directed to investigate, study, and continually monitor the welfare of areas whose resources exhibit qualities of national significance and which may have potential for inclusion in the National Park System. Accompanying the annual listing of areas shall be a synopsis, for each report previously submitted, of the current and changed condition of the resource integrity of the area and other relevant factors, compiled as a result of continual periodic monitoring and embracing the period since the previous such submission or initial report submission one year earlier. The Secretary is also directed to transmit annually to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the President of the Senate, at the beginning of each fiscal year, a complete and current list of all areas included on the Registry of Natural Landmarks and those areas of national significance listed on the National Register of Historic places which areas exhibit known or anticipated damage or threats to the integrity of their resources, along with notations as to the nature and severity of such damage or threats. Each report and annual listing shall be printed as a House document: <em>Provided</em>, That should adequate supplies of previously printed identical reports remain available, newly submitted identical reports shall be omitted from printing upon the receipt by the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives of a joint letter from the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate indicating such to be the case.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Studies of areas for potential addition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the beginning of each calendar year, along with the annual budget submission, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate a list of areas recommended for study for potential inclusion in the National Park System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In developing the list to be submitted under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) those areas that have the greatest potential to meet the established criteria of national significance, suitability, and feasibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) themes, sites, and resources not already adequately represented in the National Park System; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) public petition and Congressional resolutions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this Act shall limit the authority of the National Park Service to conduct preliminary resource assessments, gather data on potential study areas, provide technical and planning assistance, prepare or process nominations for administrative designations, update <!-- PDFPage:37 -->previous studies, or complete reconnaissance surveys of individual areas requiring a total expenditure of less than $25,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to or to affect or alter the study of any river segment for potential addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system or to apply to or to affect or alter the study of any trail for potential addition to the national trails system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall complete the study for each area for potential inclusion in the National Park System within 3 complete fiscal years following the date on which funds are first made available for such purposes. Each study under this section shall be prepared with appropriate opportunity for public involvement, including at least one public meeting in the vicinity of the area under study, and after reasonable efforts to notify potentially affected landowners and State and local governments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In conducting the study, the Secretary shall consider whether the area under study&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) possesses nationally significant natural or cultural resources and represents one of the most important examples of a particular resource type in the country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is a suitable and feasible addition to the system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each study&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall consider the following factors with regard to the area being studied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the rarity and integrity of the resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the threats to those resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) similar resources are already protected in the National Park System or in other public or private ownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the public use potential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) the interpretive and educational potential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) costs associated with acquisition, development and operation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) the socioeconomic impacts of any designation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(viii) the level of local and general public support; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ix) whether the area is of appropriate configuration to ensure long-term resource protection and visitor use;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall consider whether direct National Park Service management or alternative protection by other public agencies or the private sector is appropriate for the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall identify what alternative or combination of alternatives would in the professional judgment of the Director of the National Park Service be most effective and efficient in protecting significant resources and providing for public enjoyment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) may include any other information which the Secretary deems to be relevant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each study shall be completed in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The letter transmitting each completed study to Congress shall contain a recommendation regarding the Secretary's preferred management option for the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) New area study office</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall designate a single office to be assigned to prepare all new area studies and to implement other functions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) List of areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the beginning of each calendar year, along with the annual budget submission, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a list of areas which have been previously studied which contain primarily historical resources, and a list of areas which have been previously studied which contain primarily natural resources, in numerical order of priority for addition to the National Park System. In developing the lists, the Secretary should consider threats to resource values, cost escalation factors, and other factors listed in subsection (c) of this section. The Secretary should only include on the lists areas for which the supporting data is current and accurate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of carrying out the studies for potential new Park System units and for monitoring the welfare of those resources, there are authorized to be appropriated annually not to exceed $1,000,000.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;17<em>o</em>. National Park Service housing improvement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(1) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to develop where necessary an adequate supply of quality housing units for field employees of the National Park Service within a reasonable time frame;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to expand the alternatives available for construction and repair of essential Government housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to rely on the private sector to finance or supply housing in carrying out this section, to the maximum extent possible, in order to reduce the need for Federal appropriations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide for long-term maintenance needs of field employee housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) to eliminate unnecessary Government housing and locate such housing as is required in a manner such that primary resource values are not impaired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(2) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To enhance the ability of the Secretary of the Interior (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo;), acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to effectively manage units of the National Park System, the Secretary is authorized where necessary and justified to make available employee housing, on or off the lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service, and to rent or lease such housing to field employees of the National Park Service at rates based on the reasonable value of the housing in accordance with requirements applicable under section 5911 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(3) Review and revision of housing criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On November 12, 1996, the Secretary shall review and revise the existing criteria under which housing is provided to employees of the National Park Service. Specifically, the Secretary shall examine the existing criteria with respect to what circumstances the National Park Service requires an employee to occupy Government quarters to provide necessary services, protect Government property, or because of a lack of availability of non-Federal housing in the geographic area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(4) Submission of report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A report detailing the results of the revisions required by paragraph (3) shall be submitted to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate not later than 180 days after November 12, 1996. The report shall include justifications for keeping, or for <!-- PDFPage:59 -->changing, each of the criteria or factors used by the Department of the Interior with regard to the provision of housing to employees of the National Park Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(5) Review of condition of and costs relating to housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Using the revised criteria developed under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall undertake a review, for each unit of the National Park System, of existing government-owned&nbsp;<sup><a href="#17o_1_target" name="17o_1">1</a></sup> housing provided to employees of the National Park Service. The review shall include an assessment of the physical condition of such housing and the suitability of such housing to effectively carry out the missions of the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service. For each unit of such housing, the Secretary shall determine whether the unit is needed and justified. The review shall include estimates of the cost of bringing each unit that is needed and justified into usable condition that meets all applicable legal housing requirements or, if the unit is determined to be obsolete but is still warranted to carry out the missions of the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service, the cost of replacing the unit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(6) Authorization for housing agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For those units of the National Park System for which the review required by paragraphs (3) and (5) has been completed, the Secretary is authorized, pursuant to the authorities contained in this section and subject to the appropriation of necessary funds in advance, to enter into housing agreements with housing entities under which such housing entities may develop, construct, rehabilitate, or manage housing, located on or off public lands, for rent or lease to National Park Service employees who meet the housing eligibility criteria developed by the Secretary pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(7) Joint public-private sector housing programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) Lease to build program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the appropriation of necessary funds in advance, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) lease Federal land and interests in land to qualified persons for the construction of field employee quarters for any period not to exceed 50 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) lease developed and undeveloped non-Federal land for providing field employee quarters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Competitive leasing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each lease under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be awarded through the use of publicly advertised, competitively bid, or competitively negotiated contracting procedures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall stipulate whether operation and maintenance of field employee quarters is to be provided by the lessee, field employees or the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) shall require that the construction and rehabilitation of field employee quarters be done in accordance with the requirements of the National Park Service and local applicable building codes and industry standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) shall contain such additional terms and conditions as may be appropriate to protect the Federal interest, including limits on rents the lessee may charge field employees for the occupancy of quarters, conditions on maintenance and repairs, and agreements on the provision of charges for utilities and other infrastructure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) may be granted at less than fair market value if the Secretary determines that such lease will improve the quality and availability of field employee quarters available.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(D) Contributions by United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may make payments, subject to appropriations, or contributions in kind either in advance of or on a continuing basis to reduce the costs of planning, construction, or rehabilitation of quarters on or off Federal lands under a lease under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(8) Rental guarantee program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the appropriation of necessary funds in advance, the Secretary may enter into a lease to build arrangement as set forth in paragraph (7) with further agreement to guarantee the occupancy of field employee quarters constructed or rehabilitated under such lease. A guarantee made under this paragraph shall be in writing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not guarantee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the occupancy of more than 75 percent of the units constructed or rehabilitated under such lease; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at a rental rate that exceeds the rate based on the reasonable value of the housing in accordance with requirements applicable under section 5911 of title 5.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In no event shall outstanding guarantees be in excess of $3,000,000,<sup><a href="#17o_2_target" name="17o_2">2</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) Rental to Government employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A guarantee may be made under this section only if the lessee agrees to permit the Secretary to utilize for housing purposes any units for which the guarantee is made&nbsp;<sup><a href="#17o_3_target" name="17o_3">3</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(D) Failure to maintain a satisfactory level of operation and maintenance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the appropriation of necessary funds in advance, the Secretary may enter <!-- PDFPage:60 -->into contracts of any duration for the management, repair, and maintenance of field employee quarters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any such contract shall contain such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the United States and assure that necessary quarters are available to field employees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(11) Leasing of seasonal employee quarters</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may lease quarters at or near a unit of the national park system for use as seasonal quarters for field employees. The rent charged to field employees under such a lease shall be a rate based on the reasonable value of the quarters in accordance with requirements applicable under section 5911 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may only issue a lease under subparagraph (A) if the Secretary finds that there is a shortage of adequate and affordable seasonal quarters at or near such unit and that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the requirement for such seasonal field employee quarters is temporary; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) leasing would be more cost-effective than construction of new seasonal field employee quarters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) Unrecovered costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may pay the unrecovered costs of leasing seasonal quarters under this paragraph from annual appropriations for the year in which such lease is made.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(15) Study of housing allowances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 12 months after November 12, 1996, the Secretary shall conduct a study to determine the feasibility of providing eligible employees of the National Park Service with housing allowances rather than Government housing. The study shall specifically examine the feasibility of providing rental allowances to temporary and lower paid permanent employees. Whenever the Secretary submits a copy of such study to the Office of Management and Budget, he shall concurrently transmit copies of the report to the Resources Committee of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate.</p>
