<p class="statutory-body-1em">With regard to any ivory producing country for which the Secretary has insufficient information to make a determination pursuant to section 4221(b) of this title, the Secretary shall establish a moratorium on the importation of raw and worked ivory from such country not later than January 1, 1990, unless, based on new information, the Secretary concludes before that date that the country meets all of the criteria set forth in section 4221(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Intermediary countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a moratorium on the importation of raw and worked ivory from an intermediary country immediately upon making a determination that the country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not a party to CITES;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) imports raw or worked ivory from a country that is subject to a moratorium under this chapter after the first three months of that moratorium, unless the ivory is imported by vessel during the first six months of that moratorium and is accompanied by shipping documents which show that it was exported before the establishment of the moratorium.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suspension of moratorium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall suspend a moratorium established under this section if, after notice and public comment, the Secretary determines that the reasons for establishing the moratorium no longer exist.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Individuals may import sport-hunted elephant trophies that they have legally taken in an ivory producing country that has submitted an ivory quota.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Confiscated ivory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Trade in raw or worked ivory that is confiscated by an ivory producing country or an intermediary country and is disposed of pursuant to the CITES Ivory Control System shall not be the sole cause for the establishment of a moratorium under this subchapter if all proceeds from the disposal of the confiscated ivory are used solely to enhance wildlife conservation programs or conservation purposes of CITES. With respect to any country that was not a party to CITES at the time of such confiscation, this subsection shall not apply until such country develops appropriate measures to assure that persons with a history of illegal dealings in ivory shall not benefit from the disposal of confiscated ivory.</p>
