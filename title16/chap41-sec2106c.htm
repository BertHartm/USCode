<h4 class="note-head">Findings for Enhanced Community Fire Protection</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;171, title VIII, &sect;8003(a), May 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 473, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The severity and intensity of wildland fires has increased dramatically over the past few decades as a result of past fire and land management policies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The record 2000 fire season is a prime example of what can be expected if action is not taken.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Wildland fires threaten not only the forested resources of the United States, but also the thousands of communities intermingled with the wildlands in the wildland-urban interface.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1946 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The National Fire Plan, if implemented to achieve appropriate priorities, is the proper, coordinated, and most effective means to address the issue of wildfires.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) While adequate authorities exist to tackle the wildfire issues at the landscape level on Federal lands, there is limited authority to take action on most private lands, and the largest threat to life and property exists on private lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) There is a significant Federal interest in enhancing community protection from wildfire.&rdquo;</p>
