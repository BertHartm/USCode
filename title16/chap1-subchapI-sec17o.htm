<h4 class="subsection-head">(1) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to develop where necessary an adequate supply of quality housing units for field employees of the National Park Service within a reasonable time frame;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to expand the alternatives available for construction and repair of essential Government housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to rely on the private sector to finance or supply housing in carrying out this section, to the maximum extent possible, in order to reduce the need for Federal appropriations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide for long-term maintenance needs of field employee housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) to eliminate unnecessary Government housing and locate such housing as is required in a manner such that primary resource values are not impaired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(2) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To enhance the ability of the Secretary of the Interior (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo;), acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to effectively manage units of the National Park System, the Secretary is authorized where necessary and justified to make available employee housing, on or off the lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service, and to rent or lease such housing to field employees of the National Park Service at rates based on the reasonable value of the housing in accordance with requirements applicable under section 5911 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(3) Review and revision of housing criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On November 12, 1996, the Secretary shall review and revise the existing criteria under which housing is provided to employees of the National Park Service. Specifically, the Secretary shall examine the existing criteria with respect to what circumstances the National Park Service requires an employee to occupy Government quarters to provide necessary services, protect Government property, or because of a lack of availability of non-Federal housing in the geographic area.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:61 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(4) Submission of report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A report detailing the results of the revisions required by paragraph (3) shall be submitted to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate not later than 180 days after November 12, 1996. The report shall include justifications for keeping, or for changing, each of the criteria or factors used by the Department of the Interior with regard to the provision of housing to employees of the National Park Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(5) Review of condition of and costs relating to housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Using the revised criteria developed under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall undertake a review, for each unit of the National Park System, of existing government-owned&nbsp;<sup><a href="#17o_1_target" name="17o_1">1</a></sup> housing provided to employees of the National Park Service. The review shall include an assessment of the physical condition of such housing and the suitability of such housing to effectively carry out the missions of the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service. For each unit of such housing, the Secretary shall determine whether the unit is needed and justified. The review shall include estimates of the cost of bringing each unit that is needed and justified into usable condition that meets all applicable legal housing requirements or, if the unit is determined to be obsolete but is still warranted to carry out the missions of the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service, the cost of replacing the unit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(6) Authorization for housing agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For those units of the National Park System for which the review required by paragraphs (3) and (5) has been completed, the Secretary is authorized, pursuant to the authorities contained in this section and subject to the appropriation of necessary funds in advance, to enter into housing agreements with housing entities under which such housing entities may develop, construct, rehabilitate, or manage housing, located on or off public lands, for rent or lease to National Park Service employees who meet the housing eligibility criteria developed by the Secretary pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(7) Joint public-private sector housing programs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) shall contain such additional terms and conditions as may be appropriate to protect the Federal interest, including limits on rents the lessee may charge field employees for the occupancy of quarters, conditions on maintenance and repairs, and agreements on the provision of charges for utilities and other infrastructure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) may be granted at less than fair market value if the Secretary determines that such lease will improve the quality and availability of field employee quarters available.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(D) Contributions by United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may make payments, subject to appropriations, or contributions in kind either in advance of or on a continuing basis to reduce the costs of planning, construction, or rehabilitation of quarters on or off Federal lands under a lease under this paragraph.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) Rental to Government employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A guarantee may be made under this section only if the lessee agrees to permit the Secretary to utilize for housing purposes any units for which the guarantee is made&nbsp;<sup><a href="#17o_3_target" name="17o_3">3</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(D) Failure to maintain a satisfactory level of operation and maintenance</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may lease quarters at or near a unit of the national park system for use as seasonal quarters for field employees.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may only issue a lease under subparagraph (A) if the Secretary finds that there is a shortage of adequate and affordable seasonal quarters at or near such unit and that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the requirement for such seasonal field employee quarters is temporary; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) leasing would be more cost-effective than construction of new seasonal field employee quarters.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(15) Study of housing allowances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 12 months after November 12, 1996, the Secretary shall conduct a study to determine the feasibility of providing eligible employees of the National Park Service with housing allowances rather than Government housing. The study shall specifically examine the feasibility of providing rental allowances to temporary and lower paid permanent employees. Whenever the Secretary submits a copy of such study to the Office of Management and Budget, he shall concurrently transmit copies of the report to the Resources Committee of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate.</p>
