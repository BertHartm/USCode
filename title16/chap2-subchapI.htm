<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Pinelands area in New Jersey, containing approximately 1,000,000 acres of pine-oak forest, extensive surface and ground water resources of high quality, and a wide diversity of rare plant and animal species, provides significant ecological, natural, cultural, recreational, educational, agricultural, and public health benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a national interest in protecting and preserving these benefits for the residents of and visitors to the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a primary responsibility for protecting and enhancing these benefits resides with the State of New Jersey and the various local units of government having jurisdiction over the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in view of the longstanding Federal practice of assisting the States in creating, protecting, preserving, and enhancing areas of significant regional and urban importance, and in view of the national significance of this resource, the Federal Government has an interest in assisting the State of New Jersey and its local units of government in fulfilling their responsibilities and in avoiding adverse Federally approved or assisted impacts before these responsibilities can be undertaken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the State of New Jersey and its local units of government have authority to prevent or minimize adverse uses of the land and water resources of the Pinelands area and can, to a great extent, protect the health, safety, and general welfare by the use of such authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is a demonstrated need to protect, preserve and enhance the land and water resources of the Pinelands area through a new program which combines the capabilities and resources of the local, State and Federal governments and the private sector and provides an alternative to large-scale direct Federal acquisition and management in cases where such acquisition and management is inappropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to protect, preserve and enhance the significant values of the land and water resources of the Pinelands area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage and assist the State of New Jersey and its units of local government in the development of a comprehensive management plan for the Pinelands area in order to assure orderly public and private development in the area consistent with the findings of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide, during the development of this comprehensive plan, Federal financial assistance for the acquisition of lands in the Pinelands area that have critical ecological values which are in immediate danger of being adversely affected or destroyed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to encourage and assist the State and its units of local government in developing a governmental mechanism to implement this comprehensive plan, and to provide Federal financial assistance for the acquisition of lands consistent with the comprehensive plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to encourage adequate coordination of all government programs affecting the land and water resources of the Pinelands area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Pinelands National Reserve and Federal Project Review Area; establishment; map, availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established the Pinelands National Reserve which shall consist of the approximately 1,000,000-acre area generally depicted on the map entitled &ldquo;Pinelands National Reserve Boundary Map&rdquo; numbered NPS/80,011A and dated September 1978. Within the Pinelands National Reserve, there is hereby established the Federal Project Review Area, which shall consist of the approximately 486,000 acre area also depicted on the map. The map shall be on file and available for public inspection in the offices of the Department of the Interior in Washington, and in the offices of the State of New Jersey planning entity established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and in locations throughout the Pinelands National Reserve as determined by the planning entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State planning entity for development of comprehensive management plan; membership; representation of interests; assistance and grants to State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within thirty days after November 10, 1978, the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall request the Governor of the State of New Jersey to establish, within ninety days of such request, a planning entity to develop a comprehensive management plan for the Pinelands National Reserve. In order to carry out the purposes of this section, such planning entity shall be composed of fifteen members to be appointed as follows: one member appointed by the Secretary; one member from each of the seven counties in the Pinelands National Reserve to be appointed by the respective governing bodies of each county; and seven members to be appointed by the Governor. The membership of the planning entity shall include residents of the Pinelands National Reserve who represent economic activities such as agriculture in the area, as well as residents of New Jersey who represent conservation interests. The Secretary shall provide technical assistance and grants to the State for the development of the plan or revisions thereof: <em>Provided</em>, That such grants shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of developing the plan, shall be made only upon application of the Governor, on behalf of <!-- PDFPage:877 -->the planning entity, and shall be subject to such other conditions as the Secretary may deem appropriate to assure State and local interim protection of the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Planning entity consultations; public hearings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the development of the management plan, the planning entity shall:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consult with appropriate officials of any local government or State or Federal agency which has jurisdiction over lands and waters within the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with the officials of any local government which has jurisdiction over lands and waters within areas delineated in accordance with subsection (f)(2)(B) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consult with interested professional, scientific and citizen organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consult with a citizens advisory committee which may be established by the Governor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) conduct public hearings at places within the area, and at such other places as may be appropriate, for the purpose of providing interested persons with an opportunity to express their views with respect to matters covered by the management plan.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; rules and regulations; appraised value as minimum sale price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of achieving the policies set forth in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 215; 16 U.S.C. 528&ndash;531) and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 476) [16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.], the Secretary of Agriculture, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, may sell, at not less than appraised value, trees, portions of trees, or forest products located on National Forest System lands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation on map; prospectus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All advertised timber sales shall be designated on maps, and a prospectus shall be available to the public and interested potential bidders.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms and conditions of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The length and other terms of the contract shall be designed to promote orderly harvesting consistent with the principles set out in section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended [16 U.S.C. 1604]. Unless there is a finding by the Secretary of Agriculture that better utilization of the various forest resources (consistent with the provisions of the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 [16 U.S.C. 528&ndash;531]) will result, sales contracts shall be for a period not to exceed ten years: <em>Provided</em>, That such period may be adjusted at the discretion of the Secretary to provide additional time due to time delays caused by an act of an agent of the United States or by other circumstances beyond the control of the purchaser. The Secretary shall require the purchaser to file as soon as practicable after execution of a contract for any advertised sale with a term of two years or more, a plan of operation, which shall be subject to concurrence by the Secretary. The Secretary shall not extend any contract period with an original term of two years or more unless he finds (A) that the purchaser has diligently performed in accordance with an approved plan of operation or (B) that the substantial overriding public interest justifies the extension.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:884 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Advertisement of sales; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall advertise all sales unless he determines that extraordinary conditions exist, as defined by regulation, or that the appraised value of the sale is less than $10,000. If, upon proper offering, no satisfactory bid is received for a sale, or the bidder fails to complete the purchase, the sale may be offered and sold without further advertisement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Bidding methods; purposes; oral auction procedures; monitoring and enforcement for prevention of collusive practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the sale of trees, portions of trees, or forest products from National Forest System lands (hereinafter referred to in this subsection as &ldquo;national forest materials&rdquo;), the Secretary of Agriculture shall select the bidding method or methods which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) insure open and fair competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) insure that the Federal Government receive not less than the appraised value as required by subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) consider the economic stability of communities whose economies are dependent on such national forest materials, or achieve such other objectives as the Secretary deems necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) are consistent with the objectives of this Act and other Federal statutes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall select or alter the bidding method or methods as he determines necessary to achieve the objectives stated in clauses (A), (B), (C), and (D) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In those instances when the Secretary selects oral auction as the bidding method for the sale of any national forest materials, he shall require that all prospective purchasers submit written sealed qualifying bids. Only prospective purchasers whose written sealed qualifying bids are equal to or in excess of the appraised value of such national forest materials may participate in the oral bidding process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall monitor bidding patterns involved in the sale of national forest materials. If the Secretary has a reasonable belief that collusive bidding practices may be occurring, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) he shall report any such instances of possible collusive bidding or suspected collusive bidding practices to the Attorney General of the United States with any and all supporting data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) he may alter the bidding methods used within the affected area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) he shall take such other action as he deems necessary to eliminate such practices within the affected area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Research and demonstration projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, is authorized to dispose of, by sale or otherwise, trees, portions of trees, or other forest products related to research and demonstration projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Designation, marking, and supervision of harvesting; personnel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Designation, marking when necessary, and supervision of harvesting of trees, portions of trees, or forest products shall be conducted by persons employed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Such persons shall have no personal interest in the purchase or harvest of such products and shall not be directly or indirectly in the employment of the purchaser thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Utilization standards, methods of measurement, and harvesting practices; monetary deposits by purchasers of salvage harvests; nature, purposes and availability of designated fund; return of surplus to Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall develop utilization standards, methods of measurement, and harvesting practices for the removal of trees, portions of trees, or forest products to provide for the optimum practical use of the wood material. Such standards, methods, and practices shall reflect consideration of opportunities to promote more effective wood utilization, regional conditions, and species characteristics and shall be compatible with multiple use resource management objectives in the affected area. To accomplish the purpose of this subsection in situations involving salvage of insect-infested, dead, damaged, or down timber, and to remove associated trees for stand improvement, the Secretary is authorized to require the purchasers of such timber to make monetary deposits, as a part of the payment for the timber, to be deposited in a designated fund from which sums are to be used, to cover the cost to the United States for design, engineering, and supervision of the construction of needed roads and the cost for Forest Service sale preparation and supervision of the harvesting of such timber. Deposits of money pursuant to this subsection are to be available until expended to cover the cost to the United States of accomplishing the purposes for which deposited: <em>Provided</em>, That such deposits shall not be considered as moneys received from the national forests within the meaning of sections 500 and 501 of this title: <em>And provided further</em>, That sums found to be in excess of the cost of accomplishing the purposes for which deposited on any national forest shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Purchaser credit for permanent road construction; right of election of small business concerns; estimated cost; date of completion; use of funds for construction; effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For sales of timber which include a provision for purchaser credit for construction of permanent roads with an estimated cost in excess of $20,000, the Secretary of Agriculture shall promulgate regulations requiring that the notice of sale afford timber purchasers qualifying as &ldquo;small business concerns&rdquo; under the Small Business Act, as amended [15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.], and the regulations issued thereunder, an estimate of the cost and the right, when submitting a bid, to elect that the Secretary build the proposed road.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the purchaser makes such an election, the price subsequently paid for the timber shall include all of the estimated cost of the road. In the notice of sale, the Secretary of Agriculture shall set a date when such road shall be completed which shall be applicable to either construction by the purchaser or the Secretary, depending on the election. To accomplish re<!-- PDFPage:885 -->quested work, the Secretary is authorized to use from any receipts from the sale of timber a sum equal to the estimate for timber purchaser credits, and such additional sums as may be appropriated for the construction of roads, such funds to be available until expended, to construct a road that meets the standards specified in the notice of sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of this subsection shall become effective on October 1, 1976.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the land to be conveyed is not otherwise needed for the purposes of the National Forest System;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the total acreage to be conveyed does not exceed the amount reasonably necessary for the proposed use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the land is to be used for an established or proposed project that is described in detail in the application to the Secretary, and the conveyance would serve public objectives (either locally or at large) that outweigh the objectives and values which would be served by maintaining such land in Federal ownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the applicant is financially and otherwise capable of implementing the proposed project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the land to be conveyed has been identified for disposal in an applicable land and resource management plan under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acreage limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A conveyance under this section may not exceed 80 acres. However, this limitation shall not be construed to preclude an entity from submitting a subsequent application under this section for an additional land conveyance if the entity can demonstrate to the Secretary a need for additional land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Costs and mineral rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A conveyance under this section shall be for a nominal cost. The conveyance may not include the transfer of mineral or water rights.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) before the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date of the receipt of the application, provide notice of that receipt to the applicant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) before the end of the 120-day period beginning on that date&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) submit written notice to the applicant containing the reasons why a final determination has not been made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reversionary interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time after lands are conveyed pursuant to this section, the entity to whom the lands were conveyed attempts to transfer title to or control over the lands to another or the lands are devoted to a use other than the use for which the lands were conveyed, title to the lands shall revert to the United States.</p>

The board shall forthwith consider and decide, on a scientific basis, the issues in disagreement by majority vote, taking into consideration the evidence and data presented by the parties and such other tests and data which the board by majority vote may require. The decision of such board shall be in the form of written findings of fact and conclusions based thereon and shall be final and binding on the parties.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in order to protect certain outstanding examples of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees located in the North and South Calaveras Groves, on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the State of California has established the Calaveras Big Trees State Park;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) for similar purposes, the United States has designated certain adjacent Federal lands, amounting to approximately 379 acres, as the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) this National Forest (managed as part of the Stanislaus National Forest) is the smallest National Forest in the United States and could be more appropriately and efficiently managed as part of the Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this Act is to improve the management of the lands located in the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest, and to protect certain examples of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees, by unifying the management of the lands in such National Forest and in the California Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. LAND CONVEYANCE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Conveyance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to valid existing rights and the provisions of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary&rsquo;) is authorized and directed to convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to lands and interests therein within the Calaveras Big Trees National Forest, as generally depicted on a map numbered 20435 and dated June 5, 1989, prepared by the California Department of Parks and Recreation, to the State of California for inclusion within the Calaveras Big Trees State Park.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Map and Description</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As soon as practicable after the enactment of this Act [Oct. 17, 1990], the Secretary shall submit a map and legal description of the lands referred to in subsection (a) to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs [now Committee on Natural Resources] of the United States House of Representatives, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate. Such map and legal description shall have the same force and effect as if included in this Act, except that any clerical or typographical errors in such map or legal description may be corrected.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The conveyance shall take place only if within two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 17, 1990], there is concluded an agreement between the State of California and the Secretary whereby the State of California agrees to provide to the United States, in exchange for the lands described in subsection (a) and pursuant to terms and conditions which the Secretary finds acceptable, consideration of approximately equal value. Such consideration shall include either lands in California that the Secretary finds suitable for addition to, and are contiguous to, one or more units of the National Forest System, cash payment, or monetary grants awarded to the United States after June 1, 1990, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) No harvest of timber (except as may be necessary for the control of fire, insects, or disease) and no mining, mineral leasing, or geothermal exploration or development shall be permitted on such lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Any action by the State of California to convey any portion of such lands or interests to any entity other than the United States shall be void ab initio and shall result in the reversion to the United States of all right, title, and interest in such lands;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Any action by the State of California to permit the use of any portion of such lands for any purpose prohibited by this subsection or any purpose incompatible with the continued ability of such lands to support ponderosa pine, sugar pine, or giant sequoia trees, shall result in the reversion of all right, title, and interest in such lands to the United States. Any such lands which revert to the United States shall be incorporated into the Stanislaus National Forest and managed to preserve and protect the stands of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees located on such lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Secretary, acting through the Forest Service, shall be afforded by appropriate officials of the State of California reasonable opportunities to collect seeds from trees located on such lands for scientific or silvicultural purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Secretary, upon prior notification to the State of California, shall be entitled at any time to enter upon such lands for the purpose of monitoring the management of such lands and the compliance of the State of California with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The conveyance shall be subject to the following reservations or exceptions:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) existing ditches and canals as authorized by the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945); and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) any existing rights-of-way to provide the United States and its assigns access to federally owned lands.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the request of the Secretary, the Attorney General shall bring any action or take any other steps necessary to enforce the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Timing, Value, and Status</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Conveyance of lands to the State of California pursuant to this Act shall occur when the agreement described in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) has been reached. The restrictions and conditions specified in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) of subsection (c) shall be included in the instruments of conveyance of lands to the State of California.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Effective upon the conveyance to the State of California of lands described in subsection (a) of this section, or two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 17, 1990], whichever is sooner, the National Forest designation of such lands shall terminate. Any such lands not conveyed to the State of California shall thereupon be incorporated into the Stanislaus National Forest and managed to preserve and protect the stands of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and giant sequoia trees located on such lands.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Any lands conveyed to the United States pursuant to this Act shall be deemed national forest lands and managed according to the laws governing the management of the National Forest System. If any such lands are outside existing boundaries of one or more National Forests, the Secretary shall modify such boundaries as he deems appropriate to include such lands.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(4) Values of the respective lands exchanged between the United States and the State of California pursuant to this Act shall be of &lsquo;approximately equal value&rsquo; as that term is defined by regulations implementing the Act of January 12, 1983, known as the Small Tracts Act (16 U.S.C. 521c&ndash;521i).&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental charge for all ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b), the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 U.S.C. 497), or the 9th through 20th paragraphs under the heading &ldquo;SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS&rdquo; under the heading &ldquo;UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR&rdquo; in the Act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, chapter 2), on National Forest System lands. Permit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Permit rental charges for existing ski area permits issued pursuant to the Act of March 4, 1915, and the Act of June 4, 1897, shall be calculated in accordance with those existing permits: <em>Provided</em>, That a permittee may, at the permittee's option, use the calculation method set forth in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be calculated by adding the permittee's gross revenues from lift ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from ski school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by the slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest System land. That amount shall be increased by the gross year-round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) physically located on national forest land, including all permittee or subpermittee lodging, food service, rental shops, parking and other ancillary operations, to determine the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental charge. The final rental charge shall be calculated by multiplying the AGR by the following percentages for each revenue bracket and adding the total for each revenue bracket:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below $3,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue that exceeds $50,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection the ski area permit fee (SAPF) formula can be simply illustrated as:</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">SAPF = ((LT + SS) �0A STFP) + GRAF = AGR; AGR&nbsp;�0A&nbsp;%&nbsp;BRACKETS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In cases where ski areas are only partially located on national forest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on national forest land referred to in this subsection shall be calculated as generally described in the Forest Service Manual in effect as of January 1, 1992. Revenues from Nordic ski operations shall be included or excluded from the rental charge calculation according to the percentage of trails physically located on national forest land.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair and equitable to both the United States and the ski area permittees, the adjusted gross revenue figures for each revenue bracket in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted annually by the percent increase or decrease in the national Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year. No later than 3 years after November 12, 1996, and every 5 years thereafter the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives a report analyzing whether the ski area permit rental charge required by this section is returning a fair mar<!-- PDFPage:906 -->ket value rental to the United States together with any recommendations the Secretary may have for modifications of the system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rental charge set forth in subsection (b) of this section shall be due on June 1 of each year and shall be paid or prepaid by the permittee on a monthly, quarterly, annual or other schedule as determined appropriate by the Secretary in consultation with the permittee. Unless mutually agreed otherwise by the Secretary and the permittee, the payment or prepayment schedule shall conform to the permittee's schedule in effect prior to November 12, 1996. To reduce costs to the permittee and the Forest Service, the Secretary shall each year provide the permittee with a standardized form and worksheets (including annual rental charge calculation brackets and rates) to be used for rental charge calculation and submitted with the rental charge payment. Information provided on such forms shall be compiled by the Secretary annually and kept in the Office of the Chief, United States Forest Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The ski area permit rental charge set forth in this section shall become effective on June 1, 1996 and cover receipts retroactive to June 1, 1995: <em>Provided</em>, That if a permittee has paid rental charges for the period June 1, 1995, to June 1, 1996, under the graduated rate rental charge system formula in effect prior to November 12, 1996, such rental charges shall be credited toward the new rental charge due on June 1, 1996. In order to ensure increasing rental charge receipt levels to the United States during transition from the graduated rate rental charge system formula to the formula of this section, the rental charge paid by any individual permittee shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for the 1995&ndash;1996 permit year, either the rental charge paid for the preceding 1994&ndash;1995 base year or the rental charge calculated pursuant to this section, whichever is higher;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for the 1996&ndash;1997 permit year, either the rental charge paid for the 1994&ndash;1995 base year or the rental charge calculated pursuant to this section, whichever is higher; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for the 1997&ndash;1998 permit year, either the rental charge for the 1994&ndash;1995 base year or the rental charge calculated pursuant to this section, whichever is higher.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If an individual permittee's adjusted gross revenue for the 1995&ndash;1996, 1996&ndash;1997, or 1997&ndash;1998 permit years falls more than 10 percent below the adjusted gross revenue for the 1994&ndash;1995 base year, the rental charge paid shall be the rental charge calculated pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Non-national forest land operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under no circumstances shall revenue, or subpermittee revenue (other than lift ticket, area use pass, or ski school sales) obtained from operations physically located on non-national forest land be included in the ski area permit rental charge calculation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Revenue&rdquo; and &ldquo;sales&rdquo; defined; limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To reduce administrative costs of ski area permittees and the Forest Service the terms &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; and &ldquo;sales&rdquo;, as used in this section, shall mean actual income from sales and shall not include sales of operating equipment, refunds, rent paid to the permittee by sublessees, sponsor contributions to special events or any amounts attributable to employee gratuities or employee lift tickets, discounts, or other goods or services (except for bartered goods and complimentary lift tickets offered for commercial or other promotional purposes) for which the permittee does not receive money.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Minimum rental charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In cases where an area of national forest land is under a ski area permit but the permittee does not have revenue or sales qualifying for rental charge payment pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the permittee shall pay an annual minimum rental charge of $2 for each national forest acre under permit or a percentage of appraised land value, as determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Five-year phase-in of increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the new rental charge provided for in subsection (b)(1) of this section results in an increase in permit rental charge greater than one-half of 1 percent of the permittee's adjusted gross revenue as determined under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the new rental charge shall be phased in over a five-year period in a manner providing for increases of approximately equal increments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Construction with National Environmental Policy Act of 1969</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To reduce Federal costs in administering the provisions of this section, the reissuance of a ski area permit to provide activities similar in nature and amount to the activities provided under the previous permit shall not constitute a major Federal action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Withdrawal from mining laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to valid existing rights, all lands located within the boundaries of ski area permits issued prior to, on or after November 12, 1996, pursuant to authority of the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 U.S.C. 497), and the Act of June 4, 1897, or the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b) are hereby and henceforth automatically withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing and all amendments thereto. Such withdrawal shall continue for the full term of the permit and any modification, reissuance, or renewal thereof. Unless the Secretary requests otherwise of the Secretary of the Interior, such withdrawal shall be canceled automatically upon expiration or other termination of the permit and the land automatically restored to all appropriation not otherwise restricted under the public land laws.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section is a combination provision the basis for which is Act Mar. 4, 1907, which superseded previous provisions relating to the disposal of money received from sale of products or use of any land or resources of the forest reserves, contained in Act Feb. 1, 1905, ch. 288, &sect;5, 33 Stat. 628.</p>
<p class="note-body">Act Mar. 4, 1911, is the source of the last portion of the section beginning with the words, &ldquo;and also so much as may be necessary,&rdquo; etc. That Act provides that so much of the former Act &ldquo;which provides for refunds by the Secretary of Agriculture to depositors of moneys to secure the purchase price of timber or the use of lands or resources of the national forests such sums as may be found to be in excess of the amounts found actually due the United States, be, and is hereby, amended hereafter to appropriate and to include so much;&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words of this section reading, &ldquo;including moneys received from sale of products from or use of lands in national forests created under section 471(b) of this title&rdquo; were derived from the fourth sentence of section 9 of Act of June 7, 1924, which reads as follows: &ldquo;All receipts from the sale of products from or for the use of lands in such national forests shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, forest reserve fund, and shall be disposed of in like manner as the receipts from other national forests as provided by existing law.&rdquo; Section 471(b) of this title, referred to in text, was based on the first and fifth sentences of section 9 of the 1924 act, and was repealed by section 704(a) of Pub. L. 94&ndash;579. Section 505 of this title is based on the second and third sentences of section 9 of the 1924 act.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;and moneys received on account of permits for hunting, fishing, or camping on lands acquired under authority of sections 513 to 517 and 521 of this title,&rdquo; are from a provision of Act Mar. 4, 1917, which reads, &ldquo;Hereafter, all moneys received on account of permits for hunting, fishing, or camping, on lands acquired under authority of said Act [Act Mar. 1, 1911, ch. 186, 36 Stat. 961] or any Amendment or extension thereof, shall be disposed of as is provided by existing law for the disposition of receipts from national forests.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The National Forest System, which is managed by the United States Forest Service, was established in 1907 and has grown to include approximately 192,000,000 acres of Federal lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The public domain lands known as revested Oregon and California Railroad grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands, which are managed predominantly by the Bureau of Land Management were returned to Federal ownership in 1916 and 1919 and now comprise approximately 2,600,000 acres of Federal lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Congress recognized that, by its decision to secure these lands in Federal ownership, the counties in which these lands are situated would be deprived of revenues they would otherwise receive if the lands were held in private ownership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) These same counties have expended public funds year after year to provide services, such as education, road construction and maintenance, search and rescue, law enforcement, waste removal, and fire protection, that directly benefit these Federal lands and people who use these lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) To accord a measure of compensation to the affected counties for the critical services they provide to both county residents and visitors to these Federal lands, Congress determined that the Federal Government should share with these counties a portion of the revenues the United States receives from these Federal lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Congress enacted in 1908 and subsequently amended a law that requires that 25 percent of the revenues derived from National Forest System lands be paid to States for use by the counties in which the lands are situated for the benefit of public schools and roads.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Congress enacted in 1937 and subsequently amended a law that requires that 75 percent of the revenues derived from the revested and reconveyed grant lands be paid to the counties in which those lands are situated to be used as are other county funds, of which 50 percent is to be used as other county funds.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) For several decades primarily due to the growth of the Federal timber sale program, counties dependent on and supportive of these Federal lands received and relied on increasing shares of these revenues to provide funding for schools and road maintenance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) In recent years, the principal source of these revenues, Federal timber sales, has been sharply curtailed and, as the volume of timber sold annually from most of the Federal lands has decreased precipitously, so too have the revenues shared with the affected counties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) This decline in shared revenues has affected educational funding and road maintenance for many counties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;66, see Tables for classification], Congress recognized this trend and ameliorated its adverse consequences by providing an alternative annual safety net payment to 72 counties in Oregon, Washington, and northern California in which Federal timber sales had been restricted or prohibited by administrative and judicial decisions to protect the northern spotted owl.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The authority for these particular safety net payments is expiring and no comparable authority has been granted for alternative payments to counties elsewhere in the United States that have suffered similar losses in shared revenues from the Federal lands and in the funding for schools and roads those revenues provide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) There is a need to stabilize education and road maintenance funding through predictable payments to the affected counties, job creation in those counties, and other opportunities associated with restoration, maintenance, and stewardship of Federal lands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management face significant backlogs in infrastructure maintenance and ecosystem restoration that are difficult to address through annual appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) There is a need to build new, and strengthen existing, relationships and to improve management of public lands and waters.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note above] are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) To stabilize payments to counties to provide funding for schools and roads that supplements other available funds.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To make additional investments in, and create additional employment opportunities through, projects that improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement stewardship objectives that enhance forest ecosystems, and restore and improve land health and water quality. Such projects shall enjoy broad-based support with objectives that may include, but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) road, trail, and infrastructure maintenance or obliteration;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) soil productivity improvement;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) improvements in forest ecosystem health;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) watershed restoration and maintenance;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) restoration, maintenance and improvement of wildlife and fish habitat;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) control of noxious and exotic weeds; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) reestablishment of native species.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) To improve cooperative relationships among the people that use and care for Federal lands and the agencies that manage these lands.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition on timber purchaser road credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In financing any forest development road pursuant to section 535 of this title, the Secretary of Agriculture may not provide effective credit for road construction to any purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction of roads by timber purchasers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture makes a determination that a forest development road referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be constructed or paid for, in whole or in part, by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the Secretary shall include notice of the determination in the notice of sale of the timber or other forest products. The notice of sale shall contain, or announce the availability of, sufficient information related to the road described in the notice to permit a prospective bidder on the sale to calculate the likely cost that would be incurred by the bidder to construct or finance the construction of the road so that the bidder may reflect such cost in the bid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If there is an increase or decrease in the cost of roads constructed by the timber purchaser, caused by variations in quantities, changes or modifications subsequent to the sale of timber made in accordance with applicable timber sale contract provisions, then an adjustment to the price paid for timber harvested by the purchaser shall be made. The adjustment shall be applied by the Secretary as soon as practicable after any such design change is implemented.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special election by small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A notice of sale referred to in subsection (b) of this section containing specified road construction of $50,000 or more, shall give a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products that qualifies as a &ldquo;small business concern&rdquo; under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. <!-- PDFPage:932 -->631 et seq.), and regulations issued thereunder, the option to elect that the Secretary of Agriculture build the roads described in the notice. The Secretary shall provide the small business concern with an estimate of the cost that would be incurred by the Secretary to construct the roads on behalf of the small business concern. The notice of sale shall also include the date on which the roads described in the notice will be completed by the Secretary if the election is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the election referred to in paragraph (1) is made, the purchaser of the national forest timber or other forest products shall pay to the Secretary of Agriculture, in addition to the price paid for the timber or other forest products, an amount equal to the estimated cost of the roads which otherwise would be paid by the purchaser as provided in the notice of sale. Pending receipt of such amount, the Secretary may use receipts from the sale of national forest timber or other forest products and such additional sums as may be appropriated for the construction of roads, such funds to be available until expended, to accomplish the requested road construction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of harvesting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In each sale of national forest timber or other forest products referred to in this section, the Secretary of Agriculture is encouraged to authorize harvest of the timber or other forest products in a unit included in the sale as soon as road work for that unit is completed and the road work is approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Construction standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any forest development road that is to be constructed or paid for by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the Secretary of Agriculture may not require the purchaser to design, construct, or maintain the road (or pay for the design, construction, or maintenance of the road) to a standard higher than the standard, consistent with applicable environmental laws and regulations, that is sufficient for the harvesting and removal of the timber or other forest products, unless the Secretary bears that part of the cost necessary to meet the higher standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment of road value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any forest development road that is constructed or paid for by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the estimated cost of the road construction, including subsequent design changes, shall be considered to be money received for purposes of the payments required to be made under section 500 of this title. To the extent that the appraised value of road construction determined under this subsection reflects funds contributed by the Secretary of Agriculture to build the road to a higher standard pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary shall modify the appraisal of the road construction to exclude the effect of the Federal funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) This section and the requirements of this section shall take effect (and apply thereafter) upon the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) April 1, 1999; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date that is the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the effective date of regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to implement this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the date on which new timber sale contract provisions designed to implement this section, that have been published for public comment, are approved by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), any sale of national forest timber or other forest products for which notice of sale is provided before the effective date of this section, and any effective purchaser road credit earned pursuant to a contract resulting from such a notice of sale or otherwise earned before that effective date shall remain in effect, and shall continue to be subject to section 535 of this title and section 472a(i) of this title, and rules issued thereunder, as in effect on the day before October 21, 1998.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insured and guaranteed loan program for purchasers of national forests materials in Alaska; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized and directed to establish a special program of insured or guaranteed loans to purchasers of national forest materials in Alaska to assist such purchasers in the acquisition of equipment and the implementation of new technologies which lead to the utilization of wood products which might otherwise not be utilized. The Secretary is authorized to promulgate such regulations as he deems appropriate to define eligibility requirements for the participation in the loan program and the terms and conditions applicable to loans made under the program. Except as otherwise provided in this section or regulations promulgated specifically for this loan program, such program shall be carried out in a manner which is consistent with other authorities available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To carry out the special loan program established by this section, there are hereby authorized beginning after the fiscal year 1980 to be appropriated $5,000,000 from National Forest Fund receipts, to be deposited in a special fund in the Treasury of the United States to remain available until expended.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Identification of lands not suited for timber production; consideration of economic factors unnecessary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All provisions of section 6(k) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1604(k)) shall apply to the Tongass National Forest except that the Secretary need not consider economic factors in the identification of lands not suited for timber production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Protection of riparian habitat; maintenance of buffer zones in Tongass National Forest; relocation of prior independent sale or released volume</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure protection of riparian habitat, the Secretary shall maintain a buffer zone <!-- PDFPage:936 -->of no less than one hundred feet in width on each side of all Class I streams in the Tongass National Forest, and on those Class II streams which flow directly into a Class I stream, within which commercial timber harvesting shall be prohibited, except where independent national forest timber sales have already been sold prior to March 1, 1990, or where volume has been released prior to March 1, 1990, to either the Alaska Pulp Corporation or the Ketchikan Pulp Company pursuant to the long-term timber sale contracts numbered 12&ndash;11&ndash;010&ndash;1545 and A10fs&ndash;1042 respectively. If such an independent timber sale or released volume is within the buffer zone, the Secretary shall make every effort to relocate such independent sale or released volume to an area outside of the buffer zone. The Secretary shall use best management practices, as defined in the Region 10 Soil and Water Conservation handbook&nbsp;<sup><a href="#539d_1_target" name="539d_1">1</a></sup> (FSH 2509.22), January 1990, to assure the protection of riparian habitat on streams or portions of streams not protected by such buffer zones.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Timber supply from Tongass National Forest for purchasers qualifying as &ldquo;small business concerns&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to appropriations, the provisions of this Act and other applicable law (including but not limited to the requirements of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;588)) and in order to assure the continuation of the Small Business Administration timber sale program, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and to the extent consistent with providing for the multiple use and sustained yield of all renewable forest resources, seek to provide a supply of timber from the Tongass National Forest to those purchasers qualifying as &ldquo;small business concerns&rdquo; under the Small Business Act as amended (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.).</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 602. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) certain parcels of private land located in central and southwest Washington are intermingled with National Forest System land owned by the United States and administered by the Secretary of Agriculture as parts of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Wenatchee National Forest, and Gifford Pinchot National Forest;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the private land surface estate and some subsurface is owned by the Plum Creek Timber Company, L.P. in an intermingled checkerboard pattern, with the United States or Plum Creek owning alternate square mile sections of land or fractions of square mile sections;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the checkerboard land ownership pattern in the area has frustrated sound and efficient land management on both private and National Forest lands by complicating fish and wildlife habitat management, watershed protection, recreation use, road construction and timber harvest, boundary administration, and protection and management of threatened and endangered species and old growth forest habitat;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) acquisition by the United States of certain parcels of land that have been offered by Plum Creek for addition to the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wenatchee National Forest will serve important public objectives, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) enhancement of public access, aesthetics and recreation opportunities within or near areas of very heavy public recreational use including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) the Pacific Crest Trail;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) Snoqualmie Pass;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iv) Cle Elum Lake, Kachess Lake and Keechulus Lake; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(v) other popular recreation areas along the Interstate 90 corridor east of the Seattle-Tacoma Metropolitan Area;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) protection and enhancement of old growth forests and habitat for threatened, endangered and sensitive species, including a net gain of approximately 28,500 acres of habitat for the northern spotted owl;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) consolidation of National Forest holdings for more efficient administration and to meet a broad array of ecosystem protection and other public land management goals, including net public gains of approximately 283 miles of stream ownership, 14 miles of the route of the Pacific Crest Trail, 20,000 acres of unroaded land, and 7,360 acres of riparian land; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) a significant reduction in administrative costs to the United States through&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) consolidation of Federal land holdings for more efficient land management and planning;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) elimination of approximately 300 miles of boundary identification and posting;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) reduced right-of-way, special use, and other permit processing and issuance for roads and other facilities on National Forest System land; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iv) other administrative cost savings;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Plum Creek has selected certain parcels of National Forest System land that are logical for consolidation into Plum Creek ownership utilizing a land exchange because the parcels&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) are intermingled with parcels owned by Plum Creek; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B)(i) are generally located in less environmentally sensitive areas than the Plum Creek offered land; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) have lower public recreation and other public values than the Plum Creek offered land;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) time is of the essence in consummating a land exchange because delays may force Plum Creek to road or log the offered land and thereby diminish the public values for which the offered land is to be acquired; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) it is in the public interest to complete the land exchange at the earliest practicable date so that the offered land can be acquired and preserved by the United States for permanent public management, use, and enjoyment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this Act to further the public interest by authorizing, directing, facilitating, and expediting the consummation of the Interstate 90 land exchange so as to ensure that the offered land is expeditiously acquired for permanent public use and enjoyment.</p>
