<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Tongass National Forest timber supply; satisfaction of certain market demands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to appropriations, other applicable law, and the requirements of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;588), except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall, to the extent consistent with providing for the multiple use and sustained yield of all renewable forest resources, seek to provide a supply of timber from the Tongass National Forest which (1) meets the annual market demand for timber from such forest and (2) meets the market demand from such forest for each planning cycle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insured and guaranteed loan program for purchasers of national forests materials in Alaska; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized and directed to establish a special program of insured or guaranteed loans to purchasers of national forest materials in Alaska to assist such purchasers in the acquisition of equipment and the implemen<!-- PDFPage:917 -->tation of new technologies which lead to the utilization of wood products which might otherwise not be utilized. The Secretary is authorized to promulgate such regulations as he deems appropriate to define eligibility requirements for the participation in the loan program and the terms and conditions applicable to loans made under the program. Except as otherwise provided in this section or regulations promulgated specifically for this loan program, such program shall be carried out in a manner which is consistent with other authorities available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To carry out the special loan program established by this section, there are hereby authorized beginning after the fiscal year 1980 to be appropriated $5,000,000 from National Forest Fund receipts, to be deposited in a special fund in the Treasury of the United States to remain available until expended. Repayments of principal and interest and other recoveries on loans authorized by this section shall be credited to this fund and shall remain available until expended in order to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Study on increase of timber yields on national forest lands in Alaska; transmittal to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within three years after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall prepare and transmit to the Senate and House of Representatives a study of opportunities (consistent with the laws and regulations applicable to the management of the National Forest System) to increase timber yields on national forest lands in Alaska.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Identification of lands not suited for timber production; consideration of economic factors unnecessary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All provisions of section 6(k) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1604(k)) shall apply to the Tongass National Forest except that the Secretary need not consider economic factors in the identification of lands not suited for timber production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Protection of riparian habitat; maintenance of buffer zones in Tongass National Forest; relocation of prior independent sale or released volume</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure protection of riparian habitat, the Secretary shall maintain a buffer zone of no less than one hundred feet in width on each side of all Class I streams in the Tongass National Forest, and on those Class II streams which flow directly into a Class I stream, within which commercial timber harvesting shall be prohibited, except where independent national forest timber sales have already been sold prior to March 1, 1990, or where volume has been released prior to March 1, 1990, to either the Alaska Pulp Corporation or the Ketchikan Pulp Company pursuant to the long-term timber sale contracts numbered 12&ndash;11&ndash;010&ndash;1545 and A10fs&ndash;1042 respectively. If such an independent timber sale or released volume is within the buffer zone, the Secretary shall make every effort to relocate such independent sale or released volume to an area outside of the buffer zone. The Secretary shall use best management practices, as defined in the Region 10 Soil and Water Conservation handbook&nbsp;<sup><a href="#539d_1_target" name="539d_1">1</a></sup> (FSH 2509.22), January 1990, to assure the protection of riparian habitat on streams or portions of streams not protected by such buffer zones. For the purposes of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;Class I streams&rdquo; and &ldquo;Class II streams&rdquo; mean the same as they do in the Region 10 Aquatic Habitat Management Handbook (FSH 2609.24), June 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Timber supply from Tongass National Forest for purchasers qualifying as &ldquo;small business concerns&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to appropriations, the provisions of this Act and other applicable law (including but not limited to the requirements of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;588)) and in order to assure the continuation of the Small Business Administration timber sale program, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and to the extent consistent with providing for the multiple use and sustained yield of all renewable forest resources, seek to provide a supply of timber from the Tongass National Forest to those purchasers qualifying as &ldquo;small business concerns&rdquo; under the Small Business Act as amended (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.).</p>
