<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the intent of Congress that in making expenditures from the endowment fund under paragraph (1) to carry out activities specified in <!-- PDFPage:2055 -->that paragraph, the Foundation should give priority to funding projects that address the conservation of populations of whales that the Foundation determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are the most endangered (including the northern right whale (Eubaleana glacialis)); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) most warrant, and are most likely to benefit from, research management, or educational activities that may be funded with amounts made available from the fund.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) whale populations&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) form a significant component of marine ecosystems;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) are the subject of intense research;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the interactions that occur between ship traffic, commercial fishing, whale watching vessels, and other recreational vessels and whale populations may affect whale populations adversely;</p>
