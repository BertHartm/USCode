<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">1979&mdash;Pub. L. 96&ndash;87 substituted reference to &ldquo;section 907 of this title&rdquo; for reference to &ldquo;section 7 of this title&rdquo; in the original. Since &ldquo;section 7 of this title&rdquo; had already been translated as &ldquo;section 230f of this title&rdquo; as the probable intent of Congress the substitution of &ldquo;907&rdquo; for &ldquo;7&rdquo; required no change in text as set out in this section.</p>
