<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13186, Jan. 10, 2001, 66 F.R. 3853, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in furtherance of the purposes of the migratory bird conventions, the Migratory Bird Treaty <!-- PDFPage:1161 -->Act (16 U.S.C. 703&ndash;711), the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Acts (16 U.S.C. 668&ndash;668d), the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661&ndash;666c), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531&ndash;1544), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321&ndash;4347), and other pertinent statutes, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Migratory birds are of great ecological and economic value to this country and to other countries. They contribute to biological diversity and bring tremendous enjoyment to millions of Americans who study, watch, feed, or hunt these birds throughout the United States and other countries. The United States has recognized the critical importance of this shared resource by ratifying international, bilateral conventions for the conservation of migratory birds. Such conventions include the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds with Great Britain on behalf of Canada 1916, the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals-Mexico 1936, the Convention for the Protection of Birds and Their Environment-Japan 1972, and the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Birds and Their Environment-Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 1978.</p>
<p class="note-body">These migratory bird conventions impose substantive obligations on the United States for the conservation of migratory birds and their habitats, and through the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (Act), the United States has implemented these migratory bird conventions with respect to the United States. This Executive Order directs executive departments and agencies to take certain actions to further implement the Act.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. For purposes of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Take&rdquo; means take as defined in 50 C.F.R. 10.12, and includes both &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; and &ldquo;unintentional&rdquo; take.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Intentional take&rdquo; means take that is the purpose of the activity in question.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Unintentional take&rdquo; means take that results from, but is not the purpose of, the activity in question.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) &ldquo;Migratory bird&rdquo; means any bird listed in 50 C.F.R. 10.13.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) &ldquo;Migratory bird resources&rdquo; means migratory birds and the habitats upon which they depend.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) &ldquo;Migratory bird convention&rdquo; means, collectively, the bilateral conventions (with Great Britain/Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia) for the conservation of migratory bird resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) &ldquo;Federal agency&rdquo; means an executive department or agency, but does not include independent establishments as defined by 5 U.S.C. 104.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) &ldquo;Action&rdquo; means a program, activity, project, official policy (such as a rule or regulation), or formal plan directly carried out by a Federal agency. Each Federal agency will further define what the term &ldquo;action&rdquo; means with respect to its own authorities and what programs should be included in the agency-specific Memoranda of Understanding required by this order. Actions delegated to or assumed by nonfederal entities, or carried out by nonfederal entities with Federal assistance, are not subject to this order. Such actions, however, continue to be subject to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) &ldquo;Species of concern&rdquo; refers to those species listed in the periodic report &ldquo;Migratory Nongame Birds of Management Concern in the United States,&rdquo; priority migratory bird species as documented by established plans (such as Bird Conservation Regions in the North American Bird Conservation Initiative or Partners in Flight physiographic areas), and those species listed in 50 C.F.R. 17.11.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Federal Agency Responsibilities</em>. (a) Each Federal agency taking actions that have, or are likely to have, a measurable negative effect on migratory bird populations is directed to develop and implement, within 2 years, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) that shall promote the conservation of migratory bird populations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In coordination with affected Federal agencies, the Service shall develop a schedule for completion of the MOUs within 180 days of the date of this order. The schedule shall give priority to completing the MOUs with agencies having the most substantive impacts on migratory birds.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Each MOU shall establish protocols for implementation of the MOU and for reporting accomplishments. These protocols may be incorporated into existing actions; however, the MOU shall recognize that the agency may not be able to implement some elements of the MOU until such time as the agency has successfully included them in each agency's formal planning processes (such as revision of agency land management plans, land use compatibility guidelines, integrated resource management plans, and fishery management plans), including public participation and NEPA analysis, as appropriate. This order and the MOUs to be developed by the agencies are intended to be implemented when new actions or renewal of contracts, permits, delegations, or other third party agreements are initiated as well as during the initiation of new, or revisions to, land management plans.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Each MOU shall include an elevation process to resolve any dispute between the signatory agencies regarding a particular practice or activity.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Pursuant to its MOU, each agency shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations and within Administration budgetary limits, and in harmony with agency missions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) support the conservation intent of the migratory bird conventions by integrating bird conservation principles, measures, and practices into agency activities and by avoiding or minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse impacts on migratory bird resources when conducting agency actions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) restore and enhance the habitat of migratory birds, as practicable;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) prevent or abate the pollution or detrimental alteration of the environment for the benefit of migratory birds, as practicable;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) design migratory bird habitat and population conservation principles, measures, and practices, into agency plans and planning processes (natural resource, land management, and environmental quality planning, including, but not limited to, forest and rangeland planning, coastal management planning, watershed planning, etc.) as practicable, and coordinate with other agencies and nonfederal partners in planning efforts;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) within established authorities and in conjunction with the adoption, amendment, or revision of agency management plans and guidance, ensure that agency plans and actions promote programs and recommendations of comprehensive migratory bird planning efforts such as Partners-in-Flight, U.S. National Shorebird Plan, North American Waterfowl Management Plan, North American Colonial Waterbird Plan, and other planning efforts, as well as guidance from other sources, including the Food and Agricultural Organization's International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries;</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) ensure that environmental analyses of Federal actions required by the NEPA or other established environmental review processes evaluate the effects of actions and agency plans on migratory birds, with emphasis on species of concern;</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) provide notice to the Service in advance of conducting an action that is intended to take migratory birds, or annually report to the Service on the number of individuals of each species of migratory birds intentionally taken during the conduct of any agency action, including but not limited to banding or marking, scientific collecting, taxidermy, and depredation control;</p>
<p class="note-body">(8) minimize the intentional take of species of concern by: (i) delineating standards and procedures for such take; and (ii) developing procedures for the review and evaluation of take actions. With respect to intentional take, the MOU shall be consistent with the appropriate sections of 50 C.F.R. parts 10, 21, and 22;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1162 --><p class="note-body">(9) identify where unintentional take reasonably attributable to agency actions is having, or is likely to have, a measurable negative effect on migratory bird populations, focusing first on species of concern, priority habitats, and key risk factors. With respect to those actions so identified, the agency shall develop and use principles, standards, and practices that will lessen the amount of unintentional take, developing any such conservation efforts in cooperation with the Service. These principles, standards, and practices shall be regularly evaluated and revised to ensure that they are effective in lessening the detrimental effect of agency actions on migratory bird populations. The agency also shall inventory and monitor bird habitat and populations within the agency's capabilities and authorities to the extent feasible to facilitate decisions about the need for, and effectiveness of, conservation efforts;</p>
<p class="note-body">(10) within the scope of its statutorily-designated authorities, control the import, export, and establishment in the wild of live exotic animals and plants that may be harmful to migratory bird resources;</p>
<p class="note-body">(11) promote research and information exchange related to the conservation of migratory bird resources, including coordinated inventorying and monitoring and the collection and assessment of information on environmental contaminants and other physical or biological stressors having potential relevance to migratory bird conservation. Where such information is collected in the course of agency actions or supported through Federal financial assistance, reasonable efforts shall be made to share such information with the Service, the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey, and other appropriate repositories of such data (e.g, the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology);</p>
<p class="note-body">(12) provide training and information to appropriate employees on methods and means of avoiding or minimizing the take of migratory birds and conserving and restoring migratory bird habitat;</p>
<p class="note-body">(13) promote migratory bird conservation in international activities and with other countries and international partners, in consultation with the Department of State, as appropriate or relevant to the agency's authorities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(14) recognize and promote economic and recreational values of birds, as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(15) develop partnerships with non-Federal entities to further bird conservation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Notwithstanding the requirement to finalize an MOU within 2 years, each agency is encouraged to immediately begin implementing the conservation measures set forth above in subparagraphs (1) through (15) of this section, as appropriate and practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Each agency shall advise the public of the availability of its MOU through a notice published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Council for the Conservation of Migratory Birds</em>. (a) The Secretary of Interior shall establish an interagency Council for the Conservation of Migratory Birds (Council) to oversee the implementation of this order. The Council's duties shall include the following: (1) sharing the latest resource information to assist in the conservation and management of migratory birds; (2) developing an annual report of accomplishments and recommendations related to this order; (3) fostering partnerships to further the goals of this order; and (4) selecting an annual recipient of a Presidential Migratory Bird Federal Stewardship Award for contributions to the protection of migratory birds.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Council shall include representation, at the bureau director/administrator level, from the Departments of the Interior, State, Commerce, Agriculture, Transportation, Energy, Defense, and the Environmental Protection Agency and from such other agencies as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Application and Judicial Review</em>. (a) This order and the MOU to be developed by the agencies do not require changes to current contracts, permits, or other third party agreements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, separately enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;108, Nov. 24, 1999, 113 Stat. 1491, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Arctic Tundra Habitat Emergency Conservation Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The winter index population of mid-continent light geese was 800,000 birds in 1969, while the total population of such geese is more than 5,200,000 birds today.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The population of mid-continent light geese is expanding by over 5 percent each year, and in the absence of new wildlife management actions it could grow to more than 6,800,000 breeding light geese in 3 years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The primary reasons for this unprecedented population growth are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the expansion of agricultural areas and the resulting abundance of cereal grain crops in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the establishment of sanctuaries along the United States flyways of migrating light geese; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) a decline in light geese harvest rates.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) As a direct result of this population explosion, the Hudson Bay Lowlands Salt-Marsh ecosystem in Canada is being systematically destroyed. This ecosystem contains approximately 135,000 acres of essential habitat for migrating light geese and many other avian species. Biologists have testified that one-third of this habitat has been destroyed, one-third is on the brink of devastation, and the remaining one-third is overgrazed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The destruction of the Arctic tundra is having a severe negative impact on many avian species that breed or migrate through this habitat, including the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Canada Goose.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) American Wigeon.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Dowitcher.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Hudsonian Godwit.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) Stilt Sandpiper.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) Northern Shoveler.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) Red-Breasted Merganser.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(H) Oldsquaw.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(I) Parasitic Jaeger.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(J) Whimbrel.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(K) Yellow Rail.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) It is essential that the current population of mid-continent light geese be reduced by 50 percent by the year 2005 to ensure that the fragile Arctic tundra is not irreversibly damaged.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act are the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) To reduce the population of mid-continent light geese.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To assure the long-term conservation of mid-continent light geese and the biological diversity of the ecosystem upon which many North American migratory birds depend.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Force and Effect.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The rules published by the Service on February 16, 1999, relating to use of additional hunting methods to increase the harvest of mid-continent light geese (64 Fed.

Reg. 7517&ndash;7528), shall have the force and effect of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Public notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Service, shall take such action as is necessary to appropriately notify the public of the force and effect of the rules referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) shall apply only during the period that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) ends on the latest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the effective date of rules issued by the Service after such date of the enactment to control overabundant mid-continent light geese populations;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the date of the publication of a final environmental impact statement for such rules under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Separate fund in the United States Treasury; availability of funds until expended; &ldquo;National Wildlife Refuge System&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning with the next full fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, all revenues received by the Secretary of the Interior from the sale or other disposition of animals, salmonoid carcassas,<sup><a href="#715s_1_target" name="715s_1">1</a></sup> timber, hay, grass, or other products of the soil, minerals, shells, sand, or gravel, from other privileges, or from leases for public accommodations or facilities incidental to but not in conflict with the basic purposes for which those areas of the National Wildlife Refuge System were established, during each fiscal year in connection with the operation and management of those areas of the National Wildlife Refuge System, National Fish Hatcheries, or other areas, that are solely or primarily administered by him, through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, shall be covered into the United States Treasury and be reserved in a separate fund for disposition as hereafter prescribed. Amounts in the fund shall remain available until expended, and may be expended by the Secretary without further appropriation in the manner hereafter prescribed. The National Wildlife Refuge System (hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;system&rdquo;) includes those lands and waters administered by the Secretary as wildlife refuges, lands acquired or reserved for the protection and conservation of fish and wildlife that are listed pursuant to section 1533 of this title as endangered species or threatened species, wildlife ranges, game ranges, wildlife management areas, and waterfowl production areas established under any law, proclamation. Executive, or public land order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deduction of expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may pay from the fund any necessary expenses incurred by him in connection with the revenue-producing and revenue-sharing measures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment to counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall pay out the fund, for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1979, to each county in which is situated any fee area whichever of the following amounts is greater:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An amount equal to the product of 75 cents multiplied by the total acreage of that portion of the fee area which is located within such county.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An amount equal to three-fourths of 1 per centum of the fair market value, as determined by the Secretary, of that portion of the fee area (excluding any improvements thereto made after the date of Federal acquisition) which is located within such county.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such fee area during such fiscal year; but if a fee area is located in two or more counties, the amount each such county is entitled to shall be the amount which bears to such 25 per centum the same ratio as that portion of the fee area acreage which is within such county bears to the total acreage of such fee area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At the end of each fiscal year the Secretary shall pay out of the fund for such fiscal year to each county in which any reserve area is situated, an amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such area during such fiscal year: <em>Provided</em>, That when any such area is situated in more than one county the distributive share to each county from the aforesaid receipts shall be proportional to its acreage of such reserve area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands shall each be treated as a county.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of determining the fair market value of fee areas under paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) appraise before September 30, 1979, all fee areas for which payments under this section were not authorized for fiscal years occurring before October 1, 1977; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) appraise all other fee areas, within five years after October 17, 1978, in the order in which such areas were first established by the Service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">After initial appraisal under clause (i) or (ii), each fee area shall thereafter be reappraised by the Secretary at least once during each five-year period occurring after the date of the initial appraisal. Until any fee area referred to in clause (ii) is initially appraised under this subparagraph, the fair market value of such area <!-- PDFPage:1174 -->shall be deemed to be that adjusted cost of the area which was used to determine payments under this subsection for fiscal year 1977; and in no case may the amount of any payment to any local government under paragraph (1)(B) with respect to any fee area be less than the amount paid under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection (as in effect on September 30, 1977) with respect to such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make the determinations required under this subsection in such manner as the Secretary considers to be equitable and in the public interest. All such determinations shall be final and conclusive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Each county which receives payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to any fee area or reserve area shall distribute, under guidelines established by the Secretary, such payments on a proportional basis to those units of local government (including, but not limited to, school districts and the county itself in appropriate cases) which have incurred the loss or reduction of real property tax revenues by reason of the existence of such area. In any case in which a unit of local government other than the county acts as the collecting and distributing agency for real property taxes, the payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made to such other unit which shall distribute the payments in accordance with the guidelines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments under this paragraph may be made to units of local government in cases in which subparagraph (A) will not effect the purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Payments received by units of local government under this subsection may be used by such units for any governmental purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of appropriations equal to difference between amount of net receipts and aggregate amount of required payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the net receipts in the fund which are attributable to revenue collections for any fiscal year do not equal the aggregate amount of payments required to be made for such fiscal year under subsection (c) of this section to counties, there are authorized to be appropriated to the fund an amount equal to the difference between the total amount of net receipts and such aggregate amount of payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfer and use of excess of net receipts over aggregate amount of required payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the net receipts in the fund which are attributable to revenue collections for any fiscal year exceed the aggregate amount of payments required to be made for such fiscal year under subsection (c) of this section to counties, the amount of such excess shall be transferred to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund for use in the acquisition of suitable areas for migratory bird refuges under the provisions of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 715&ndash;715r).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Terms, conditions, and regulations for execution of revenue producing activities; disposal of animals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall carry out any revenue producing activity referred to in subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section within any fee area or reserve area subject to such terms, conditions, or regulations, including sales in the open markets, as the Secretary determines to be in the best interest of the United States. The Secretary may, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, dispose of animals which are surplus to any such area by exchange of the same or other kinds, gift or loan to public institutions for exhibition or propagation purposes, and for the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of information relating to the conservation of wildlife.</p>
