<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean has resulted in the deaths of millions of dolphins.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Significant awareness and increased concern for the health and safety of dolphin populations has encouraged a change in fishing methods worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) United States tuna fishing vessels have led the world in the development of fishing methods to reduce dolphin mortalities in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and United States tuna processing companies have voluntarily promoted the marketing of tuna that is dolphin safe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nations harvesting yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have indicated their willingness to participate in appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce, and eventually eliminate, dolphin mortality in that fishery.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States to&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1417 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) eliminate the marine mammal mortality resulting from the intentional encirclement of dolphins and other marine mammals in tuna purse seine fisheries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) secure appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce, and eventually eliminate, the mortality referred to in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that the market of the United States does not act as an incentive to the harvest of tuna caught in association with dolphins or with driftnets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) secure appropriate multilateral agreements to ensure that United States tuna fishing vessels shall have continued access to productive tuna fishing grounds in the South Pacific Ocean and elsewhere; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) encourage observer coverage on purse seine vessels fishing for tuna outside of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean in a fishery in which the Secretary has determined that a regular and significant association occurs between marine mammals and tuna, and in which tuna is harvested through the use of purse seine nets deployed on or to encircle marine mammals.</p>
