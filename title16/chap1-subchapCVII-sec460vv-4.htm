<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) areas in the State of Oklahoma reviewed in such final environmental statement or referenced in subsection (d) of this section and not designated wilderness upon enactment of this subchapter shall be managed for multiple use in accordance with land management plans pursuant to section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 [16 U.S.C. 1604], as amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976, except that such areas need not be managed for the purpose of protecting their suitability for wilderness designation prior to or during revision of the initial land management plans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) unless expressly authorized by Congress, the Department of Agriculture shall not conduct any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of the National Forest System lands in the State of Oklahoma for the purpose of determining their suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System.</p>
