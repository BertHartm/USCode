<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3501. Congressional statement of findings and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and along the shore areas of the Great Lakes of the United States and the adjacent wetlands, marshes, estuaries, inlets and nearshore waters provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) habitats for migratory birds and other wildlife; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) habitats which are essential spawning, nursery, nesting, and feeding areas for commercially and recreationally important species of finfish and shellfish, as well as other aquatic organisms such as sea turtles;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) coastal barriers contain resources of extraordinary scenic, scientific, recreational, natural, historic, archeological, cultural, and economic importance; which are being irretrievably damaged and lost due to development on, among, and adjacent to, such barriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) coastal barriers serve as natural storm protective buffers and are generally unsuitable for development because they are vulnerable to hurricane and other storm damage and because natural shoreline recession and the movement of unstable sediments undermine manmade structures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) certain actions and programs of the Federal Government have subsidized and permitted development on coastal barriers and the result has been the loss of barrier resources, threats to human life, health, and property, and the expenditure of millions of tax dollars each year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a program of coordinated action by Federal, State, and local governments is critical to the more appropriate use and conservation of coastal barriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress declares that it is the purpose of this chapter to minimize the loss of human life, wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues, and the damage to fish, wildlife, and <!-- PDFPage:2082 -->other natural resources associated with the coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and along the shore areas of the Great Lakes by restricting future Federal expenditures and financial assistance which have the effect of encouraging development of coastal barriers, by establishing the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System, and by considering the means and measures by which the long-term conservation of these fish, wildlife, and other natural resources may be achieved.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Boundary review and modification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At least once every 5 years, the Secretary shall review the maps referred to in subsection (a) of this section and shall make, in consultation with the appropriate State, local, and Federal officials, such minor and technical modifications to the boundaries of System units as are necessary solely to reflect changes that have occurred in the size or location of any System unit as a result of natural forces.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additions to System</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may add a parcel of real property to the System, if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Guidelines for certain recommendations and determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making any recommendation to the Congress regarding the addition of any area to the System or in determining whether, at the time of the inclusion of a System unit within the System, a coastal barrier is undeveloped, the Secretary shall consider whether within the area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the density of development is less than 1 structure per 5 acres of land above mean high tide; and</p>
