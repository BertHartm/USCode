<p class="statutory-body-2em">A group of fishermen constituting more than 50 percent of the permit holders, or holding more than 50 percent of the allocation, in the fishery for which a limited access privilege program to harvest fish is sought, may submit a petition to the Secretary requesting that the relevant Council or Councils with authority over the fishery be authorized to initiate the development of the program. Any such petition shall clearly state the fishery to which the limited access privilege program would apply. For multispecies permits in the Gulf of Mexico, only those participants who have substantially fished the species proposed to be included in the limited access program shall be eligible to sign a petition for such a program and shall serve as the basis for determining the percentage described in the first sentence of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certification by Secretary</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) New England and Gulf referendum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Except as provided in clause (iii) for the Gulf of Mexico commercial red snapper fishery, the New England and Gulf Councils may not submit, and the Secretary may not approve or implement, a fishery management plan or amendment that creates an individual fishing quota program, including a Secretarial plan, unless such a system, as ultimately developed, has been approved by more than 2/3 of those voting in a referendum among eligible permit holders, or other persons described in clause (v), with respect to the New England Council, and by a majority of those voting in the referendum among eligible permit holders with respect to the Gulf <!-- PDFPage:1931 -->Council. For multispecies permits in the Gulf of Mexico, only those participants who have substantially fished the species proposed to be included in the individual fishing quota program shall be eligible to vote in such a referendum. If an individual fishing quota program fails to be approved by the requisite number of those voting, it may be revised and submitted for approval in a subsequent referendum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The Secretary shall conduct a referendum under this subparagraph, including notifying all persons eligible to participate in the referendum and making available to them information concerning the schedule, procedures, and eligibility requirements for the referendum process and the proposed individual fishing quota program. Within 1 year after January 12, 2007, the Secretary shall publish guidelines and procedures to determine procedures and voting eligibility requirements for referenda and to conduct such referenda in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The provisions of section 1883(c) of this title shall apply in lieu of this subparagraph for an individual fishing quota program for the Gulf of Mexico commercial red snapper fishery.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) The Secretary shall promulgate criteria for determining whether additional fishery participants are eligible to vote in the New England referendum described in clause (i) in order to ensure that crew members who derive a significant percentage of their total income from the fishery under the proposed program are eligible to vote in the referendum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) In this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;individual fishing quota&rdquo; does not include a sector allocation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Transferability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing a limited access privilege program, a Council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish a policy and criteria for the transferability of limited access privileges (through sale or lease), that is consistent with the policies adopted by the Council for the fishery under paragraph (5); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish, in coordination with the Secretary, a process for monitoring of transfers (including sales and leases) of limited access privileges.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Preparation and implementation of secretarial plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection also applies to a plan prepared and implemented by the Secretary under section 1854(c) or 1854(g) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Antitrust savings clause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the operation of any of the antitrust laws. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;antitrust laws&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in subsection (a) of section 12 of title 15, except that such term includes section 45 of title 15 to the extent that such section 45 applies to unfair methods of competition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Auction and other programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing a limited access privilege program, a Council shall consider, and may provide, if appropriate, an auction system or other program to collect royalties for the initial, or any subsequent, distribution of allocations in a limited access privilege program if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the system or program is administered in such a way that the resulting distribution of limited access privilege shares meets the program requirements of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) revenues generated through such a royalty program are deposited in the Limited Access System Administration Fund established by section 1855(h)(5)(B) of this title and available subject to annual appropriations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Cost recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing a limited access privilege program, a Council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) develop a methodology and the means to identify and assess the management, data collection and analysis, and enforcement programs that are directly related to and in support of the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide, under section 1854(d)(2) of this title, for a program of fees paid by limited access privilege holders that will cover the costs of management, data collection and analysis, and enforcement activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Characteristics</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A limited access privilege established after January 12, 2007, is a permit issued for a period of not more than 10 years that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be renewed before the end of that period, unless it has been revoked, limited, or modified as provided in this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will be revoked, limited, or modified if the holder is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing under section 554 of title 5, to have failed to comply with any term of the plan identified in the plan as cause for revocation, limitation, or modification of a permit, which may include conservation requirements established under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may be revoked, limited, or modified if the holder is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing under section 554 of title 5, to have committed an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may be acquired, or reacquired, by participants in the program under a mechanism established by the Council if it has been revoked, limited, or modified under paragraph (2) or (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limited access privilege assisted purchase program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Council may submit, and the Secretary may approve and implement, a program which reserves up to 25 percent of any fees collected from a fishery under section 1854(d)(2) of this title to be used, pursuant to section 53706(a)(7) of title 46, to issue obligations that aid in financing&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1932 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the purchase of limited access privileges in that fishery by fishermen who fish from small vessels; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligibility criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Council making a submission under paragraph (1) shall recommend criteria, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, that a fisherman must meet to qualify for guarantees under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) and the portion of funds to be allocated for guarantees under each subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Effect on certain existing shares and programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter, or the amendments made by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006, shall be construed to require a reallocation or a reevaluation of individual quota shares, processor quota shares, cooperative programs, or other quota programs, including sector allocation in effect before January 12, 2007.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Transition rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The requirements of this section shall not apply to any quota program, including any individual quota program, cooperative program, or sector allocation for which a Council has taken final action or which has been submitted by a Council to the Secretary, or approved by the Secretary, within 6 months after January 12, 2007, except that&mdash;</p>
