<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of erosion-related or water management-related problems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program established under this subchapter shall be directed toward identifying and correcting such erosion-related or water management-related problems as may exist within each designated special area. Assistance under this subchapter may be provided to any geographic area of the United States only if such area is first designated by the Secretary as having severe and chronic erosion-related or water management-related problems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Bases for designation; reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In designating a geographic area as a special area under this subchapter, the Secretary shall review national resources inventory data, river basin plans, special studies, and other resource information; consider tons of soil loss prevented, acres protected, and volume of water conserved; and evaluate the degree and type of interagency cooperation, the degree of local acceptance of the planned target activity, and the significant favorable and adverse impacts of the targeted activity. The Secretary shall prepare and publish a report setting forth an assessment of the problems, objectives, and priorities in such area, and a schedule for the implementation of the program under this subchapter. The report shall also indicate how the program with respect to such area takes into consideration ongoing programs of Federal, State, and local agencies, including soil conservation districts, relating to soil and water conservation, pollution abatement, or the improvement or protection of forest land. The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, assure that all Department of Agriculture conservation programs operating in a designated special area complement the conservation objectives outlined for such area.</p>
