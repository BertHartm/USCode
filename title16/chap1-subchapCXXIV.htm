<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) No buffer zones</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Water rights</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the lands designated as wilderness by this subchapter are located at the headwaters of the streams and rivers on those lands, with few, if any, actual or proposed water resource facilities located upstream from such lands and few, if any, opportunities for diversion, storage, or other uses of water occurring outside such lands that would adversely affect the wilderness or other values of such lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the lands designated as wilderness by this subchapter generally are not suitable for use for development of new water resource facilities, or for the expansion of existing facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) it is possible to provide for proper management and protection of the wilderness and other values of such lands in ways different from those utilized in other legislation designating as wilderness lands not sharing the attributes of the lands designated as wilderness by this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Statutory construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Nothing in this subchapter shall constitute or be construed to constitute either an express or implied reservation of any water or water rights with respect to the lands designated as a national conservation area or as wilderness by this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall follow the procedural and substantive requirements of the law of the State of Colorado in order to obtain and hold any new water rights with respect to the Conservation Area and the Wilderness.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) New projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;water resource facility&rdquo; means irrigation and pumping facilities, reservoirs, water conservation works, aqueducts, canals, ditches, pipelines, wells, hydropower projects, and transmission and other ancillary facilities, and other water diversion, storage, and carriage structures. Such term does not include any such facilities related to or used for the purpose of livestock grazing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Except as otherwise provided by subsection (g) of this section or other provisions of this subchapter, on and after October 24, 2000, neither the President nor any other officer, employee, or agent of the United States shall fund, assist, authorize, or issue a license or permit for the development of any new water resource facility within the wilderness area designated by this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this subchapter shall affect the authority that the Secretary may or may <!-- PDFPage:781 -->not have to manage recreational uses on the Colorado River, except as such authority may be affected by compliance with paragraph (3). Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect the authority of the Secretary to manage the public lands between the boundary of the Conservation Area and the edge of the Colorado River.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Subject to valid existing rights, all lands owned by the Federal Government between the 100-year high water mark on each shore of the Colorado River, as designated on the Map from the line labeled &ldquo;Line A&rdquo; on the east to the boundary between the States of Colorado and Utah on the west, are hereby withdrawn from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and</p>
