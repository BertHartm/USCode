<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental charge for all ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b), the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 U.S.C. 497), or the 9th through 20th paragraphs under the heading &ldquo;SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS&rdquo; under the heading &ldquo;UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR&rdquo; in the Act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, chapter 2), on National Forest System lands. Permit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to the National Forest <!-- PDFPage:893 -->Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Permit rental charges for existing ski area permits issued pursuant to the Act of March 4, 1915, and the Act of June 4, 1897, shall be calculated in accordance with those existing permits: <em>Provided</em>, That a permittee may, at the permittee's option, use the calculation method set forth in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be calculated by adding the permittee's gross revenues from lift ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from ski school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by the slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest System land. That amount shall be increased by the gross year-round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) physically located on national forest land, including all permittee or subpermittee lodging, food service, rental shops, parking and other ancillary operations, to determine the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental charge. The final rental charge shall be calculated by multiplying the AGR by the following percentages for each revenue bracket and adding the total for each revenue bracket:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below $3,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue that exceeds $50,000,000.</p>
