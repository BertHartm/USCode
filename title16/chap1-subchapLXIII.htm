<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Election of term; fair market value; termination; notification; lease of Federal lands: restrictive covenants, offer to prior owner or leaseholder</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except for property which the Secretary specifically determines is needed for interpretive or resources management purposes of the seashore, the owner of improved property or of agricultural property on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary under sections 459c to 459c&ndash;7 of this title may, as a condition of such acquisition, retain for himself and his or her heirs and assigns a right of use and occupancy for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years, or, in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of his or her spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Unless the property is wholly or partly donated to the United States, the Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of acquisition minus the fair market value on that date of the right retained by the owner. A right retained pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his or her determination that it is being exercised in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of sections 459c to 459c&ndash;7 of this title, and it shall terminate by operation of law upon the Secretary's notifying the holder of the right of such determination and tendering to him or her an amount equal to the fair market value of that portion of the right which remains unexpired. Where appropriate in the discretion of the Secretary, he or she may lease federally owned land (or any interest therein) which has been acquired by the Secretary under sections 459c to 459c&ndash;7 of this title, and which was agricultural land prior to its acquisition. Such lease shall be subject to such restrictive covenants as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of sections 459c to 459c&ndash;7 of this title. Any land to be leased by the Secretary under this section shall be offered first for such lease to the person who owned such land or was a leaseholder thereon immediately before its acquisition by the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Improved and agricultural property&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in sections 459c to 459c&ndash;7 of this title, the term &ldquo;improved property&rdquo; shall mean a private noncommercial dwelling, including the land on which it is situated, whose construction was begun before September 1, 1959, or, in the case of areas added by action of the Ninety-fifth Congress, May 1, 1978 or, in the case of areas added by action of the Ninety-sixth Congress, May 1, 1979, and structures accessory thereto (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;), together with such amount and locus of the property adjoining and in the same ownership as such dwelling as the Secretary designates to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of such dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use and occupancy. In making such designation the Secretary shall take into account the manner of noncommercial residential use and occupancy in which the dwelling and such adjoining property has usually been enjoyed by its owner or occupant. The term &ldquo;agricultural property&rdquo; as used in sections 459c to 459c&ndash;7 of this title means lands which were in regular use for, or were being converted to agricultural, ranching, or dairying purposes as of May 1, 1978 or, in the case of areas added by action of the Ninety-sixth Congress, May 1, 1979, together with residential and other structures related to the above uses of the property that were in existence or under construction as of May 1, 1978.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment deferral; scheduling; interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In acquiring those lands authorized by the Ninety-fifth Congress for the purposes of sections 459c to 459c&ndash;7 of this title, the Secretary may, when agreed upon by the landowner involved, defer payment or schedule payments over a period of ten years and pay interest on the unpaid balance at a rate not exceeding that paid by the Treasury of the United States for borrowing purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Lands donated by State of California</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to accept and manage in accordance with sections 459c to 459c&ndash;7 of this title, any lands and improvements within or adjacent to the seashore which are donated by the State of California or its political subdivisions. He is directed to accept any such lands offered for donation which comprise the Tomales Bay State Park, or lie between said park and Fish Hatchery Creek. The boundaries of the seashore shall be changed to include any such donated lands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fee or admission charge prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no fee or admission charge may be levied for admission of the general public to the seashore.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;459e&ndash;1. Acquisition of property</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary; manner and place; concurrence of State owner; transfer from Federal agency to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary; liability of United States under contracts contingent on appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to acquire, and it is the intent of Congress that he shall acquire as appropriated funds become available for the purpose or as such acquisition can be accomplished by donation or with donated funds or by transfer, exchange, or otherwise, the lands, waters, and other property, and improvements thereon and any interest therein, within the boundaries of the seashore as established under section 459e of this title. Any property or interest therein owned by the State of New York, by Suffolk County, or by any other political subdivision of said State may be acquired only with the concurrence of such owner. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal property located within such area may, with the concurrence of the agency having custody thereof, be transferred without consideration to the admin<!-- PDFPage:491 -->istrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for use by him in carrying out the provisions of sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title. In exercising his authority to acquire property in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the Secretary may enter into contracts requiring the expenditure, when appropriated, of funds authorized by sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title, but the liability of the United States under any such contract shall be contingent on the appropriation of funds sufficient to fulfill the obligations thereby incurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment; notice in Federal Register</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the Secretary determines that lands and waters or interests therein have been acquired by the United States in sufficient quantity to provide an administrative unit, he shall declare the establishment of the Fire Island National Seashore by publication of notice in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall pay not more than the fair market value, as determined by him, for any land or interest therein acquired by purchase.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exchange of property; cash equalization payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When acquiring land by exchange the Secretary may accept title to any nonfederally owned land located within the boundaries of the national seashore and convey to the grantor any federally owned land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. The lands so exchanged shall be approximately equal in fair market value, but the Secretary may accept cash from or pay cash to the grantor in order to equalize the values of the lands exchanged.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation of condemnation power during existence of zoning ordinance; Davis Park-Smith Point County Park area exception; beneficial owner's election of alternatives as condition for acquisition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With one exception the Secretary shall not acquire any privately owned improved property or interests therein within the boundaries of the seashore or any property or interests therein within the communities delineated on the boundary map mentioned in section 459e of this title, except beach or waters and adjoining land within such communities which the Secretary determines are needed for public access to the beach, without the consent of the owners so long as the appropriate local zoning agency shall have in force and applicable to such property a duly adopted, valid, zoning ordinance that is satisfactory to the Secretary. The sole exception to this limitation on the power of the Secretary to condemn improved property where appropriate zoning ordinances exist shall be in the approximately eight-mile area from the easterly boundary of the Brookhaven town park at Davis Park, in the town of Brookhaven, to the westerly boundary of the Smith Point County Park. In this area only, when the Secretary deems it advisable for carrying out the purposes of sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title or to improve the contiguity of the park land and ease its administration, the Secretary may acquire any land or improvements therein by condemnation. In every case in which the Secretary exercises this right of condemnation of improved property the beneficial owner or owners (not being a corporation) of any improved property so condemned, provided he, she, or they held the same or a greater estate in the property on July 1, 1963, may elect as a condition of such acquisition by the Secretary any one of the following three alternatives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the Secretary shall take the said property in fee simple absolute and pay the fair market value thereof as of the date of such taking;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the owner or owners shall retain a life estate in said property, measured on the life of the sole owner or on the life of any one person among multiple owners (notice of the person so designated to be filed in writing with the Secretary within six months after the taking) or on the life of the survivor in title of any estate held on July 1, 1963, as a tenancy by the entirety. The price in such case shall be diminished by the actuarial fair market value of the life estate retained, determined on the basis of standard actuarial methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that the owner or owners shall retain an estate for twenty-five years. The price in this case shall likewise be diminished by the value of the estate retained.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Improved property&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;improved property&rdquo; as used in sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title shall mean any building, the construction of which was begun before July 1, 1963, and such amount of land, not in excess of two acres in the case of a residence or ten acres in the case of a commercial or industrial use, on which the building is situated as the Secretary considers reasonably necessary to the use of the building: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may exclude from improved properties any beach or waters, together with so much of the land adjoining such beach or waters as he deems necessary for public access thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Undeveloped tracts and property; suspension of condemnation authority; natural state</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority of the Secretary to condemn undeveloped tracts within the Dune District as depicted on map entitled &ldquo;Fire Island National Seashore&rdquo; numbered OGP&ndash;0004 dated May, 1978, is suspended so long as the owner or owners of the undeveloped property therein maintain the property in its natural state. Undeveloped property within the Dune District that is acquired by the Secretary shall remain in its natural state.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Sale of property acquired by condemnation; excepted properties; proceeds available for acquisition of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall sell any property described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph acquired by condemnation under sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title to the highest bidder; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) no property shall be sold at less than its fair market value; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) no property shall be sold unless it is sold subject to covenants or other restrictions that will ensure that the use of such property conforms&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) to any approved zoning ordinance or amendment thereof to which such property is subject.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The property referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is any property within the boundaries of the national seashore as delineated on the map mentioned in section 459e of this title except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) property within the Dune district referred to in subsection (g) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) beach or waters and adjoining land within the exempt communities referred to in the first sentence of subsection (e) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) property within the eight-mile area described in the second sentence of subsection (e) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) any property acquired prior to October 1, 1982, that the Secretary determines should be retained to further the purpose of sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all moneys received from sales under paragraph (1) of this subsection may be retained and shall be available to the Secretary, without further appropriation, only for purposes of acquiring property under sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Injunctive relief; termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon or after the commencement of any action for condemnation with respect to any property under sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title, the Secretary, through the Attorney General of the United States, may apply to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for a temporary restraining order or injunction to prevent any use of, or construction upon, such property that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) fails, or would result in a failure of such property, to conform to the standards specified in regulations issued under section 459e&ndash;2(a) of this title in effect at the time such use or construction began; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commercial or industrial use prohibition; size, location or use restrictions for commercial, residential, and other structures; reconciliation of population density with protection of natural resources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The standards specified in such regulations shall have the object of (1) prohibiting new commercial or industrial uses, other than commercial or industrial uses which the Secretary considers are consistent with the purposes of sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title, of all property within the national seashore, and (2) promoting the protection and development for purposes of sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title of the land within the national seashore by means of limitations or restrictions on the size, location or use of any commercial, residential, and other structures. In accomplishing these objectives, such standards shall seek to reconcile the population density of the seashore on October 17, 1984, with the protection of the natural resources of the Seashore&nbsp;<sup><a href="#459e-2_1_target" name="459e-2_1">1</a></sup> consistent with the purposes for which it has been established as provided by sections 459e to 459e&ndash;9 of this title.</p>

Such approval shall remain effective for so long as such ordinance or amendment remains in effect as approved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adverse provisions and absence of notice for variance as requiring disapproval of ordinances</h4>

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may accept any lands donated by the State of North Carolina subject to a provision for reversion to the State conditioned upon continued use of the property for national seashore purposes. Land donated by the State of North Carolina pursuant to this subsection shall constitute consideration for the transfer by the United States of 1.5 acres of land that is to be used as a site for a public health facility in the village of Hatteras, Dare County, North Carolina.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exchange of property; cash equalization payments</h4>

Failing to effectuate an exchange of properties of approximately equal fair market value, the Secretary may accept cash from or pay cash to the grantor in such an exchange in order to equalize the values of the properties exchanged.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Owner's reservation of right of use and occupancy for residential purposes for life or fixed term of years; exclusion of property necessary for public use and access; election of term</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who on January 1, 1966, owned property which on July 1, 1963, was developed and used for noncommercial residential purposes may reserve for himself and his assigns, as a condition to the purchase or acquisition by exchange of such property by the Secretary, a right of use and occupancy of the residence and not in excess of three acres of land on which the residence is situated, for noncommercial residential purposes for a term ending at the death of the owner, or the death of his spouse, or the death of either of them, or, in lieu thereof, for a definite term not to exceed twenty-five years: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may exclude from such reserved property any marsh, beach, or waters, together with so much of the land adjoining such marsh, beach, or waters as he deems necessary for public access thereto. The owner shall elect the term of the right to be reserved. The Secretary is authorized to accept donations of property for purposes of the seashore in which a right of use and occupancy for noncommercial residential purposes is reserved for the period stated in this subsection if the land on which the residence is situated and to which the right attaches is not in excess of three acres and there is excluded from the reserved property such marsh, beach, or waters and adjoining land as the Secretary deems necessary for public use and access thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Termination of use and occupancy inconsistent with statutory purposes and upon tender of sum for unexpired right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A right of use and occupancy reserved in lands that are donated or otherwise acquired pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his determination that such use and occupancy is being exercised in a manner not consistent with the purposes of sections 459g to 459g&ndash;7 of this title and upon tender to the holder of the right of an amount equal to the fair market value of that portion of the right which remains unexpired on the date of termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Administrative site; landing dock and related approach or access facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or acquire by exchange, not to exceed one hundred acres of lands or interests in lands at or near Beaufort, North Carolina, as an administrative site, and for a landing dock and related facilities that may be used to provide a suitable approach or access to the seashore.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Within the boundaries of the seashore, the Secretary may acquire lands, waters, and interests therein by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange, except that property owned by a State or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only with the consent of the owner. The Secretary may acquire by any of the above methods not more than four hundred acres of land or interests therein outside of the seashore boundaries on the mainland in the vicinity of Biloxi-Gulfport, Mississippi, for an administrative site and related facilities for access to the seashore.

<p class="statutory-body">With respect to improved residential property acquired for the purposes of sections 459h to 459h&ndash;10 of this title, which is beneficially owned by a natural person and which the Secretary of the Interior determines can be continued in that use for a limited period of time without undue interference with the administration, development, or public use of the seashore, the owner thereof may on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary retain a right of use and occupancy of the property for noncommercial residential purposes for a term, as the owner may elect, ending either (1) at the death of the owner or his spouse, whichever occurs later, or (2) not more than twenty-five years from the date of acquisition. Any right so retained may during its existence be transferred or assigned. The Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less their fair market value on such date of the right retained by the owner.</p>
