<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) of this section determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of any of the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) disease or predation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to any species over which program responsibilities have been vested in the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Reorganization Plan Numbered 4 of 1970&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in any case in which the Secretary of Commerce determines that such species should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be listed as an endangered species or a threatened species, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) be changed in status from a threatened species to an endangered species,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">he shall so inform the Secretary of the Interior; who shall list such species in accordance with this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any case in which the Secretary of Commerce determines that such species should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be removed from any list published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) be changed in status from an endangered species to a threatened species,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">he shall recommend such action to the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of the Interior, if he concurs in the recommendation, shall implement such action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary of the Interior may not list or remove from any list any such species, and may not change the status of any such species which are listed, without a prior favorable determination made pursuant to this section by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary, by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and to the maximum extent prudent and determinable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall, concurrently with making a determination under paragraph (1) that a species is an endangered species or a threatened species, designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) may, from time-to-time thereafter as appropriate, revise such designation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The Secretary shall not designate as critical habitat any lands or other geographical areas owned or controlled by the Department of Defense, or designated for its use, that are subject to an integrated natural resources management plan prepared under section 670a of this title, if the Secretary determines in writing that such plan provides a benefit to the species for which critical habitat is proposed for designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Nothing in this paragraph affects the requirement to consult under section 1536(a)(2) of this title with respect to an agency action (as that term is defined in that section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Nothing in this paragraph affects the obligation of the Department of Defense to comply with section 1538 of this title, including the prohibition preventing extinction and taking of endangered species and threatened species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basis for determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall make determinations required by subsection (a)(1) of this section solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts, if any, being made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by pred<!-- PDFPage:1782 -->ator control, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation practices, within any area under its jurisdiction; or on the high seas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall give consideration to species which have been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) designated as requiring protection from unrestricted commerce by any foreign nation, or pursuant to any international agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) identified as in danger of extinction, or likely to become so within the foreseeable future, by any State agency or by any agency of a foreign nation that is responsible for the conservation of fish or wildlife or plants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall designate critical habitat, and make revisions thereto, under subsection (a)(3) of this section on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact, the impact on national security, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) To the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after receiving the petition of an interested person under section 553(e) of title 5, to add a species to, or to remove a species from, either of the lists published under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. If such a petition is found to present such information, the Secretary shall promptly commence a review of the status of the species concerned. The Secretary shall promptly publish each finding made under this subparagraph in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within 12 months after receiving a petition that is found under subparagraph (A) to present substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted, the Secretary shall make one of the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The petitioned action is not warranted, in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The petitioned action is warranted, in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a general notice and the complete text of a proposed regulation to implement such action in accordance with paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The petitioned action is warranted, but that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the immediate proposal and timely promulgation of a final regulation implementing the petitioned action in accordance with paragraphs (5) and (6) is precluded by pending proposals to determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) expeditious progress is being made to add qualified species to either of the lists published under subsection (c) of this section and to remove from such lists species for which the protections of this chapter are no longer necessary,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register, together with a description and evaluation of the reasons and data on which the finding is based.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A petition with respect to which a finding is made under subparagraph (B)(iii) shall be treated as a petition that is resubmitted to the Secretary under subparagraph (A) on the date of such finding and that presents substantial scientific or commercial information that the petitioned action may be warranted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Any negative finding described in subparagraph (A) and any finding described in subparagraph (B)(i) or (iii) shall be subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall implement a system to monitor effectively the status of all species with respect to which a finding is made under subparagraph (B)(iii) and shall make prompt use of the authority under paragraph 7&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1533_1_target" name="1533_1">1</a></sup> to prevent a significant risk to the well being of any such species.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) To the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after receiving the petition of an interested person under section 553(e) of title 5, to revise a critical habitat designation, the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific information indicating that the revision may be warranted. The Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Within 12 months after receiving a petition that is found under clause (i) to present substantial information indicating that the requested revision may be warranted, the Secretary shall determine how he intends to proceed with the requested revision, and shall promptly publish notice of such intention in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection, the provisions of section 553 of title 5 (relating to rulemaking procedures), shall apply to any regulation promulgated to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to any regulation proposed by the Secretary to implement a determination, designation, or revision referred to in subsection (a)(1) or (3) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not less than 90 days before the effective date of the regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) publish a general notice and the complete text of the proposed regulation in the Federal Register, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) give actual notice of the proposed regulation (including the complete text of the regulation) to the State agency in each State in which the species is believed to occur, and to each county, or equivalent jurisdiction in which the species is believed to occur, and invite the comment of such agency, and each such jurisdiction, thereon;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) insofar as practical, and in cooperation with the Secretary of State, give notice of the proposed regulation to each foreign nation in <!-- PDFPage:1783 -->which the species is believed to occur or whose citizens harvest the species on the high seas, and invite the comment of such nation thereon;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) give notice of the proposed regulation to such professional scientific organizations as he deems appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) publish a summary of the proposed regulation in a newspaper of general circulation in each area of the United States in which the species is believed to occur; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) promptly hold one public hearing on the proposed regulation if any person files a request for such a hearing within 45 days after the date of publication of general notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Within the one-year period beginning on the date on which general notice is published in accordance with paragraph (5)(A)(i) regarding a proposed regulation, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) if a determination as to whether a species is an endangered species or a threatened species, or a revision of critical habitat, is involved, either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a final regulation to implement such determination,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) a final regulation to implement such revision or a finding that such revision should not be made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) notice that such one-year period is being extended under subparagraph (B)(i), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) notice that the proposed regulation is being withdrawn under subparagraph (B)(ii), together with the finding on which such withdrawal is based; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) subject to subparagraph (C), if a designation of critical habitat is involved, either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a final regulation to implement such designation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) notice that such one-year period is being extended under such subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If the Secretary finds with respect to a proposed regulation referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) that there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the determination or revision concerned, the Secretary may extend the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) for not more than six months for purposes of soliciting additional data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If a proposed regulation referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) is not promulgated as a final regulation within such one-year period (or longer period if extension under clause (i) applies) because the Secretary finds that there is not sufficient evidence to justify the action proposed by the regulation, the Secretary shall immediately withdraw the regulation. The finding on which a withdrawal is based shall be subject to judicial review. The Secretary may not propose a regulation that has previously been withdrawn under this clause unless he determines that sufficient new information is available to warrant such proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) is extended under clause (i) with respect to a proposed regulation, then before the close of such extended period the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register either a final regulation to implement the determination or revision concerned, a finding that the revision should not be made, or a notice of withdrawal of the regulation under clause (ii), together with the finding on which the withdrawal is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A final regulation designating critical habitat of an endangered species or a threatened species shall be published concurrently with the final regulation implementing the determination that such species is endangered or threatened, unless the Secretary deems that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) it is essential to the conservation of such species that the regulation implementing such determination be promptly published; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) critical habitat of such species is not then determinable, in which case the Secretary, with respect to the proposed regulation to designate such habitat, may extend the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) by not more than one additional year, but not later than the close of such additional year the Secretary must publish a final regulation, based on such data as may be available at that time, designating, to the maximum extent prudent, such habitat.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Neither paragraph (4), (5), or (6) of this subsection nor section 553 of title 5 shall apply to any regulation issued by the Secretary in regard to any emergency posing a significant risk to the well-being of any species of fish or wildlife or plants, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) at the time of publication of the regulation in the Federal Register the Secretary publishes therein detailed reasons why such regulation is necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case such regulation applies to resident species of fish or wildlife, or plants, the Secretary gives actual notice of such regulation to the State agency in each State in which such species is believed to occur.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such regulation shall, at the discretion of the Secretary, take effect immediately upon the publication of the regulation in the Federal Register. Any regulation promulgated under the authority of this paragraph shall cease to have force and effect at the close of the 240-day period following the date of publication unless, during such 240-day period, the rulemaking procedures which would apply to such regulation without regard to this paragraph are complied with. If at any time after issuing an emergency regulation the Secretary determines, on the basis of the best appropriate data available to him, that substantial evidence does not exist to warrant such regulation, he shall withdraw it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The publication in the Federal Register of any proposed or final regulation which is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter shall include a summary by the Secretary of the data on which such regulation is based and shall show the relationship of such data to such regulation; and if such regulation designates or revises critical habitat, such summary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, also include a brief description and evaluation of those activities (whether public or private) which, in the opinion of the Secretary, if undertaken may adversely modify such habitat, or may be affected by such designation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lists</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Interior shall publish in the Federal Register a list of all species de<!-- PDFPage:1784 -->termined by him or the Secretary of Commerce to be endangered species and a list of all species determined by him or the Secretary of Commerce to be threatened species. Each list shall refer to the species contained therein by scientific and common name or names, if any, specify with respect to each such species over what portion of its range it is endangered or threatened, and specify any critical habitat within such range. The Secretary shall from time to time revise each list published under the authority of this subsection to reflect recent determinations, designations, and revisions made in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conduct, at least once every five years, a review of all species included in a list which is published pursuant to paragraph (1) and which is in effect at the time of such review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determine on the basis of such review whether any such species should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be removed from such list;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) be changed in status from an endangered species to a threatened species; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) be changed in status from a threatened species to an endangered species.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Each determination under subparagraph (B) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Protective regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any species is listed as a threatened species pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall issue such regulations as he deems necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of such species. The Secretary may by regulation prohibit with respect to any threatened species any act prohibited under section 1538(a)(1) of this title, in the case of fish or wildlife, or section 1538(a)(2) of this title, in the case of plants, with respect to endangered species; except that with respect to the taking of resident species of fish or wildlife, such regulations shall apply in any State which has entered into a cooperative agreement pursuant to section 1535(c) of this title only to the extent that such regulations have also been adopted by such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Similarity of appearance cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, by regulation of commerce or taking, and to the extent he deems advisable, treat any species as an endangered species or threatened species even though it is not listed pursuant to this section if he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such species so closely resembles in appearance, at the point in question, a species which has been listed pursuant to such section that enforcement personnel would have substantial difficulty in attempting to differentiate between the listed and unlisted species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect of this substantial difficulty is an additional threat to an endangered or threatened species; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such treatment of an unlisted species will substantially facilitate the enforcement and further the policy of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Recovery plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall develop and implement plans (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;recovery plans&rdquo;) for the conservation and survival of endangered species and threatened species listed pursuant to this section, unless he finds that such a plan will not promote the conservation of the species. The Secretary, in developing and implementing recovery plans, shall, to the maximum extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give priority to those endangered species or threatened species, without regard to taxonomic classification, that are most likely to benefit from such plans, particularly those species that are, or may be, in conflict with construction or other development projects or other forms of economic activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) incorporate in each plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a description of such site-specific management actions as may be necessary to achieve the plan's goal for the conservation and survival of the species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) objective, measurable criteria which, when met, would result in a determination, in accordance with the provisions of this section, that the species be removed from the list; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) estimates of the time required and the cost to carry out those measures needed to achieve the plan's goal and to achieve intermediate steps toward that goal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, in developing and implementing recovery plans, may procure the services of appropriate public and private agencies and institutions, and other qualified persons. Recovery teams appointed pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall report every two years to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives on the status of efforts to develop and implement recovery plans for all species listed pursuant to this section and on the status of all species for which such plans have been developed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall, prior to final approval of a new or revised recovery plan, provide public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment on such plan. The Secretary shall consider all information presented during the public comment period prior to approval of the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each Federal agency shall, prior to implementation of a new or revised recovery plan, consider all information presented during the public comment period under paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall implement a system in cooperation with the States to monitor effectively for not less than five years the status of all species which have recovered to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this chapter are no longer necessary and which, in accordance with the provisions of this section, have been removed from either of the lists published under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall make prompt use of the authority under paragraph 7&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1533_2_target" name="1533_2">2</a></sup> of subsection <!-- PDFPage:1785 -->(b) of this section to prevent a significant risk to the well being of any such recovered species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Agency guidelines; publication in Federal Register; scope; proposals and amendments: notice and opportunity for comments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish, and publish in the Federal Register, agency guidelines to insure that the purposes of this section are achieved efficiently and effectively. Such guidelines shall include, but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) procedures for recording the receipt and the disposition of petitions submitted under subsection (b)(3) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) criteria for making the findings required under such subsection with respect to petitions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a ranking system to assist in the identification of species that should receive priority review under subsection (a)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a system for developing and implementing, on a priority basis, recovery plans under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall provide to the public notice of, and opportunity to submit written comments on, any guideline (including any amendment thereto) proposed to be established under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Submission to State agency of justification for regulations inconsistent with State agency's comments or petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in the case of any regulation proposed by the Secretary under the authority of this section, a State agency to which notice thereof was given in accordance with subsection (b)(5)(A)(ii) of this section files comments disagreeing with all or part of the proposed regulation, and the Secretary issues a final regulation which is in conflict with such comments, or if the Secretary fails to adopt a regulation pursuant to an action petitioned by a State agency under subsection (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary shall submit to the State agency a written justification for his failure to adopt regulations consistent with the agency's comments or petition.</p>
