<p class="note-body">1980&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 96&ndash;515, &sect;202(a), (b), in par. (3) substituted provision directing that no grant be made for more than 50 per centum of the aggregate cost of carrying out projects and programs specified in section 470a(d)(1) and (2) of this title in any one fiscal year, except that for costs of State or local historic surveys or inventories the Secretary provide 70 per centum of the aggregate cost involved in any one fiscal year for provision directing that no grant be made for more than 50 per centum of the total cost involved, as determined by the Secretary, which determination was to be final, and inserted provision following cl.
