<p class="statutory-body">When there is a catastrophic regional fishery disaster the Secretary may, upon the request of, <!-- PDFPage:1905 -->and in consultation with, the Governors of affected States, establish a regional economic transition program to provide immediate disaster relief assistance to the fishermen, charter fishing operators, United States fish processors, and owners of related fishery infrastructure affected by the disaster.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program components</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the availability of appropriations, the program shall provide funds or other economic assistance to affected entities, or to governmental entities for disbursement to affected entities, for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) meeting immediate regional shoreside fishery infrastructure needs, including processing facilities, cold storage facilities, ice houses, docks, including temporary docks and storage facilities, and other related shoreside fishery support facilities and infrastructure while ensuring that those projects will not result in an increase or replacement of fishing capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) financial assistance and job training assistance for fishermen who wish to remain in a fishery in the region that may be temporarily closed as a result of environmental or other effects associated with the disaster;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) funding, pursuant to the requirements of section 1861a(b) of this title, to fishermen who are willing to scrap a fishing vessel and permanently surrender permits for fisheries named on that vessel; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Job training</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State participation obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The participation by a State in the program shall be conditioned upon a commitment by the appropriate State entity to ensure that the relevant State fishery meets the requirements of section 1861a(b) of this title to ensure excess capacity does not re-enter the fishery.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No matching required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may waive the matching requirements of section 1861a of this title, section 4107 of this title, and any other provision of law under which the Federal share of the cost of any activity is limited to less than 100 percent if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no reasonable means are available through which applicants can meet the matching requirement; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Catastrophic regional fishery disaster defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section the term &ldquo;catastrophic regional fishery disaster&rdquo; means a natural disaster, including a hurricane or tsunami, or a regulatory closure (including regulatory closures resulting from judicial action) to protect human health or the marine environment, that&mdash;</p>
