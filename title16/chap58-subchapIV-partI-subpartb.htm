<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the program established under this subpart&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) highly erodible cropland that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) if permitted to remain untreated could substantially reduce the agricultural production capability for future generations; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines had a cropping history or was considered to be planted for 4 of the 6 years preceding the date of enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (except for land enrolled in the conservation reserve program as of that date);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enrollment of the land would facilitate a net savings in groundwater or surface water resources of the agricultural operation of the producer; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the portion of land in a field not enrolled in the conservation reserve in a case in which more than 50 percent of the land in the field is enrolled as a buffer, if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Extension of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a contract that is modified under this section that provides for the planting of hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife corridors, if the original term of the contract was less than 15 years, the owner or operator may extend the contract to a term of not to exceed 15 years.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not incur, through a conversion under this section, any additional expense on the acres, including the expense involved in the original establishment of the vegetative cover, that would result in cost share for costs under this section in excess of the costs that would have been subject to cost share for the new practice had that practice been the original practice.</p>
