Any portion of land acquired outside the park boundaries and not utilized for exchange shall be reported to the General Services Administration for disposal under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.]. Any Federal property located within the boundaries of the park may be transferred without consideration to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for the pur<!-- PDFPage:125 -->poses of the park.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Improved property&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;improved property&rdquo;, as used in this section, shall mean a detached, noncommercial residential dwelling, the construction of which was begun before January 1, 1969, together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated, the said land being in the same ownership as the dwelling, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures accessory to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated.</p>
