<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Required research</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, conduct a study of the effect of intentional encirclement (including chase) on dolphins and dolphin stocks incidentally taken in the course of purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The study, which shall commence on October 1, 1997, shall consist of abundance surveys as described in paragraph (2) and stress studies as described in paragraph (3), and shall address the question of whether such encirclement is having a significant adverse impact on any depleted dolphin stock in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Population abundance surveys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The abundance surveys under this subsection shall survey the abundance of such depleted stocks and shall be conducted during each of the calendar years 1998, 1999, and 2000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stress studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The stress studies under this subsection shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a review of relevant stress-related research and a 3-year series of necropsy samples from dolphins obtained by commercial vessels;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1625 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a 1-year review of relevant historical demographic and biological data related to dolphins and dolphin stocks referred to in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an experiment involving the repeated chasing and capturing of dolphins by means of intentional encirclement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No later than 90 days after publishing the finding under subsection (g)(2) of section 1385 of this title, the Secretary shall complete and submit a report containing the results of the research described in this subsection to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the United States House of Representatives Committees on Resources and on Commerce, and to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other research</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to conducting the research described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and in cooperation with the nations participating in the International Dolphin Conservation Program and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, undertake or support appropriate scientific research to further the goals of the International Dolphin Conservation Program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specific areas of research</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Research carried out under paragraph (1) may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) projects to devise cost-effective fishing methods and gear so as to reduce, with the goal of eliminating, the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in connection with commercial purse seine fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) projects to develop cost-effective methods of fishing for mature yellowfin tuna without setting nets on dolphins or other marine mammals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) projects to carry out stock assessments for those marine mammal species and marine mammal stocks taken in the purse seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, including species or stocks not within waters under the jurisdiction of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) projects to determine the extent to which the incidental take of nontarget species, including juvenile tuna, occurs in the course of purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, the geographic location of the incidental take, and the impact of that incidental take on tuna stocks and nontarget species.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary the following amounts, to be used by the Secretary to carry out the research described in subsection (a) of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000.</p>
