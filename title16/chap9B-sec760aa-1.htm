<p class="statutory-body">In furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, the Secretary of the Interior may accept any gifts, devises, or bequests of real and personal property, or proceeds therefrom, or interests therein, for the benefit of the National Fish Hatchery System. Such acceptance may be subject to the terms of any restrictive or affirmative covenant, or condition of servitude, if such terms are deemed by the Secretary to be in accordance with law and compatible with the purpose for which acceptance is sought.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any gifts and bequests of money and proceeds from the sales of other property received as gifts or bequests pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in a separate account in the Treasury and may be expended without further appropriation by the Secretary for the benefit of the System programs administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Gifts, devises, and bequests for particular facilities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Disbursal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any gift, devise, or bequest made for the benefit of a facility of the System shall be disbursed only for the benefit of that facility and without further appropriations.</p>
