<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Jurisdiction; management; ranges; ecological balance objectives; scientific recommendations; forage allocation adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All wild free-roaming horses and burros are hereby declared to be under the jurisdiction of the Secretary for the purpose of management and protection in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The Secretary is authorized and directed to protect and manage wild free-roaming horses and burros as components of the public lands, and he may designate and maintain specific ranges on public lands as sanctuaries for their protection and preservation, where the Secretary after consultation with the wildlife agency of the State wherein any such range is proposed and with the Advisory Board established in section 1337 of this title deems such action desirable. The Secretary shall manage wild free-roaming horses and burros in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands. He shall consider the recommendations of qualified scientists in the field of biology and ecology, some of whom shall be independent of both Federal and State agencies and may include members of the Advisory Board established in section 1337 of this title. All management activities shall be at the minimal feasible level and shall be carried out in consultation with the wildlife agency of the State wherein such lands are located in order to protect the natural ecological balance of all wildlife species which inhabit such lands, particularly endangered wildlife species. Any adjustments in forage allocations on any such lands shall take into consideration the needs of other wildlife species which inhabit such lands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inventory and determinations; consultation; overpopulation; research study: submittal to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall maintain a current inventory of wild free-roaming horses and burros on given areas of the public lands. The purpose of such inventory shall be to: make determinations as to whether and where an overpopulation exists and whether action should be taken to remove excess animals; determine appropriate management levels of wild free-roaming horses and burros on these areas of the public lands; and determine whether appropriate management levels should be achieved by the removal or destruction of excess animals, or other options (such as sterilization, or natural controls on population levels). In making such determinations the Secretary shall consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, wildlife agencies of the State or States wherein wild free-roaming horses and burros are located, such individuals independent of Federal and State government as have been recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, and such other individuals whom he determines have scientific expertise and special knowledge of wild horse and burro protection, wildlife management and animal husbandry as related to rangeland management.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Where the Secretary determines on the basis of (i) the current inventory of lands within his jurisdiction; (ii) information contained in any land use planning completed pursuant to section 1712 of title 43; (iii) information contained in court ordered environmental impact statements as defined in section 1902 of title 43; and (iv) such additional information as becomes available to him from time to time, including that information developed in the research study mandated by this section, or in the absence of the information contained in (i&ndash;iv) above on the basis of all information currently available to him, that an overpopulation exists on a given area of the public lands and that ac<!-- PDFPage:1475 -->tion is necessary to remove excess animals, he shall immediately remove excess animals from the range so as to achieve appropriate management levels. Such action shall be taken, in the following order and priority, until all excess animals have been removed so as to restore a thriving natural ecological balance to the range, and protect the range from the deterioration associated with overpopulation:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall order old, sick, or lame animals to be destroyed in the most humane manner possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall cause such number of additional excess wild free-roaming horses and burros to be humanely captured and removed for private maintenance and care for which he determines an adoption demand exists by qualified individuals, and for which he determines he can assure humane treatment and care (including proper transportation, feeding, and handling): <em>Provided</em>, That, not more than four animals may be adopted per year by any individual unless the Secretary determines in writing that such individual is capable of humanely caring for more than four animals, including the transportation of such animals by the adopting party; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary shall cause additional excess wild free-roaming horses and burros for which an adoption demand by qualified individuals does not exist to be destroyed in the most humane and cost efficient manner possible.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of furthering knowledge of wild horse and burro population dynamics and their interrelationship with wildlife, forage and water resources, and assisting him in making his determination as to what constitutes excess animals, the Secretary shall contract for a research study of such animals with such individuals independent of Federal and State government as may be recommended by the National Academy of Sciences for having scientific expertise and special knowledge of wild horse and burro protection, wildlife management and animal husbandry as related to rangeland management. The terms and outline of such research study shall be determined by a research design panel to be appointed by the President of the National Academy of Sciences. Such study shall be completed and submitted by the Secretary to the Senate and House of Representatives on or before January 1, 1983.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Title of transferee to limited number of excess animals adopted for requisite period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where excess animals have been transferred to a qualified individual for adoption and private maintenance pursuant to this chapter and the Secretary determines that such individual has provided humane conditions, treatment and care for such animal or animals for a period of one year, the Secretary is authorized upon application by the transferee to grant title to not more than four animals to the transferee at the end of the one-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loss of status as wild free-roaming horses and burros; exclusion from coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Wild free-roaming horses and burros or their remains shall lose their status as wild free-roaming horses or burros and shall no longer be considered as falling within the purview of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) upon passage of title pursuant to subsection (c) of this section except for the limitation of subsection (c)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1333_1_target" name="1333_1">1</a></sup> of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if they have been transferred for private maintenance or adoption pursuant to this chapter and die of natural causes before passage of title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) upon destruction by the Secretary or his designee pursuant to subsection (b) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if they die of natural causes on the public lands or on private lands where maintained thereon pursuant to section 1334 of this title and disposal is authorized by the Secretary or his designee; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) upon destruction or death for purposes of or incident to the program authorized in this section; <em>Provided</em>, That no wild free-roaming horse or burro or its remains may be sold or transferred for consideration for processing into commercial products.</p>
