<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) with respect to such restored wetland, made subject to an easement to be recorded on public land records, and which shall remain in force for as long as the converted wetland for which the restoration is to mitigate remains in agricultural use or is not returned to its original wetland classification with equivalent functions and values, and which easement prohibits making alterations to such restored wetland that lower the restored wetland's functions and values; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such wetland was converted subsequent to December 23, 1985, but prior to November 28, 1990, and the wetland values, acreage, and functions are mitigated by the producer through the restoration of a converted wetland, the conversion of which occurred or was commenced prior to December 23, 1985, if such restoration meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) of paragraph (2).</p>
