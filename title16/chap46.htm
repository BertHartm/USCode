<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) decline to implement any such standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a State regulatory authority (with respect to each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility declines to implement any standard established by subsection (d) of this section which is determined under subsection (a) of this section to be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, such authority or nonregulated electric utility shall state in writing the reasons therefor. Such statement of reasons shall be available to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a State regulatory authority implements a standard established by subsection (d)(7) or (8) of this section, such authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the impact that implementation of such standard would have on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation or servicing of energy conservation, energy efficiency or other demand side management measures, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) implement such standard so as to assure that utility actions would not provide such utilities with unfair competitive advantages over such small businesses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following Federal standards are hereby established:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cost of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Rates charged by any electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, to reflect the costs of providing electric service to such class, as determined under section 2625(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Declining block rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The energy component of a rate, or the amount attributable to the energy component in a rate, charged by any electric utility for providing electric service during any period to any class of electric consumers may not decrease as kilowatt-hour consumption by such class increases during such period except to the extent that such utility demonstrates that the costs to such utility of providing electric service to such class, which costs are attributable to such energy component, decrease as such consumption increases during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time-of-day rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by any electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a time-of-day basis which reflects the costs of providing electric service to such class of electric consumers at different times of the day unless such rates are not cost-effective with respect to such class, as determined under section 2625(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Seasonal rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Investments in conservation and demand management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates allowed to be charged by a State regulated electric utility shall be such that the utility's investment in and expenditures for energy conservation, energy efficiency resources, and other demand side management measures are at least as profitable, giving appropriate consideration to income lost from reduced sales due to investments in and expenditures for conservation and efficiency, as its investments in and expenditures for the construction of new generation, transmission, and distribution equipment. Such energy conservation, energy efficiency resources and other demand side management measures shall be appropriately monitored and evaluated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rates charged by any electric utility shall be such that the utility is encouraged to make investments in, and expenditures for, all cost-effective improvements in the energy efficiency of power generation, transmission and distribution. In considering regulatory changes to achieve the objectives of this paragraph, State regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities shall consider the disincentives caused by existing ratemaking policies, and practices, and consider incentives that would encourage better maintenance, and investment in more efficient power generation, transmission and distribution equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Consideration of the effects of wholesale power purchases on utility cost of capital; effects of leveraged capital structures on the reliability of wholesale power sellers; and assurance of adequate fuel supplies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To the extent that a State regulatory authority requires or allows electric utilities for which it has ratemaking authority to consider the purchase of long-term wholesale power supplies as a means of meeting electric demand, such authority shall perform a general evaluation of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the potential for increases or decreases in the costs of capital for such utilities, and any resulting increases or decreases in the retail rates paid by electric consumers, that may result from purchases of long-term wholesale power supplies in lieu of the construction of new generation facilities by such utilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) whether the use by exempt wholesale generators (as defined in section 79z&ndash;5a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2621_1_target" name="2621_1">1</a></sup> of title 15) of capital structures which employ proportionally greater amounts of debt than the capital structures of such utilities threatens reliability or provides an unfair advantage for exempt wholesale generators over such utilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) whether to implement procedures for the advance approval or disapproval of the purchase of a particular long-term wholesale power supply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) whether to require as a condition for the approval of the purchase of power that there be reasonable assurances of fuel supply adequacy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of implementing the provisions of this paragraph, any reference contained in this section to November 9, 1978, shall be deemed to be a reference to October 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a State regulatory authority from taking such action, including action with respect to the allowable capital structure of exempt wholesale generators, as such State regulatory authority may determine to be in the public interest as a result of performing evaluations under the standards of subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding section 2634 of this title and paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 2622(a) of this title, each State regulatory authority shall consider and make a determination concerning the standards of subparagraph (A) in accordance with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, without regard to any proceedings commenced prior to October 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c) of section 2622 of this title, each State regulatory authority shall consider and make a determination concerning whether it is appropriate to implement the standards set out in subparagraph (A) not later than one year after October 24, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Net metering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall make available upon request net metering service to any electric consumer that the electric utility serves.

The time-based rate schedule shall enable the electric consumer to manage energy use and cost through advanced metering and communications technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The types of time-based rate schedules that may be offered under the schedule referred to in subparagraph (A) include, among others&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) time-of-use pricing whereby electricity prices are set for a specific time period on an advance or forward basis, typically not changing more often than twice a year, based on the utility's cost of generating and/or purchasing such electricity at the wholesale level for the benefit of the consumer. Prices paid for energy consumed during these periods shall be pre-established and known to consumers in advance of such consumption, allowing them to vary their demand and usage in response to such prices and manage their energy costs by shifting usage to a lower cost period or reducing their consumption overall;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) critical peak pricing whereby time-of-use prices are in effect except for certain peak days, when prices may reflect the costs of generating and/or purchasing electricity at the wholesale level and when consumers may receive additional discounts for reducing peak period energy consumption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) real-time pricing whereby electricity prices are set for a specific time period on an advanced or forward basis, reflecting the utility's cost of generating and/or purchasing electricity at the wholesale level, and may change as often as hourly; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) credits for consumers with large loads who enter into pre-established peak load reduction agreements that reduce a utility's planned capacity obligations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Each electric utility subject to subparagraph (A) shall provide each customer requesting a time-based rate with a time-based meter capable of enabling the utility and customer to offer and receive such rate, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For purposes of implementing this paragraph, any reference contained in this section to November 9, 1978, shall be deemed to be a reference to August 8, 2005.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In a State that permits third-party marketers to sell electric energy to retail electric consumers, such consumers shall be entitled to receive the same time-based metering and communications device and service as a retail electric consumer of the electric utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c) of section 2622 of this title, each State regulatory authority shall, not later than 18 months after August 8, 2005, conduct an investigation in accordance with section 2625(i) of this title and issue a decision whether it is appropriate to implement the standards set out in subparagraphs (A) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(15) Interconnection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each electric utility shall make available, upon request, interconnection service to any electric consumer that the electric utility serves. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;interconnection service&rdquo; means service to an electric consumer under which an on-site generating facility on the consumer's premises shall be connected to the local distribution facilities. Interconnection services shall be offered based upon the standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers: IEEE Standard 1547 for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems, as they may be amended from time to time. In addition, agreements and procedures shall be established whereby the services are offered shall promote current best practices of interconnection for distributed generation, including but not limited to practices stipulated in model codes adopted by associations of state regulatory agencies. All such agreements and procedures shall be just and reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2625. Special rules for standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cost of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In undertaking the consideration and making the determination under section 2621 of this title with respect to the standard concerning cost of service established by section 2621(d)(1) of this title, the costs of providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be determined on the basis of methods prescribed by the State regulatory authority (in the case of a State regulated electric utility) or by the electric utility (in the case of a nonregulated electric utility). Such methods shall to the maximum extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) permit identification of differences in cost-incurrence, for each such class of electric consumers, attributable to daily and seasonal time of use of service and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) permit identification of differences in cost-incurrence attributable to differences in customer demand, and energy components of cost. In prescribing such methods, such State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility shall take into account the extent to which total costs to an electric utility are likely to change if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) additional capacity is added to meet peak demand relative to base demand; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) additional kilowatt-hours of electric energy are delivered to electric consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time-of-day rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In undertaking the consideration and making the determination required under section 2621 of this title with respect to the standard for time-of-day rates established by section 2621(d)(3) of this title and the standard for time-based metering and communications established by section 2621(d)(14) of this title, a time-of-day rate charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be determined to be cost-effective with respect to each such class if the long-run benefits of such rate to the electric utility and its electric consumers in the class concerned are likely to exceed the metering and communications costs and other costs associated with the use of such rates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Load management techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In undertaking the consideration and making the determination required under section 2621 of this title with respect to the standard for load management techniques established by section 2621(d)(6) of this title, a load management technique shall be determined, by the State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility, to be cost-effective if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such technique is likely to reduce maximum kilowatt demand on the electric utility, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the long-run cost-savings to the utility of such reduction are likely to exceed the long-run costs to the utility associated with implementation of such technique.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Master metering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Separate metering shall be determined appropriate for any new building for purposes of section 2623(b)(1) of this title if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is more than one unit in such building,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the occupant of each such unit has control over a portion of the electric energy used in such unit, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) with respect to such portion of electric energy used in such unit, the long-run benefits to the electric consumers in such building exceed the costs of purchasing and installing separate meters in such building.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1988 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Automatic adjustment clauses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An automatic adjustment clause of an electric utility meets the requirements of this subsection if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such clause is determined, not less often than every four years, by the State regulatory authority (with respect to an electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or by the electric utility (in the case of a nonregulated electric utility), after an evidentiary hearing, to provide incentives for efficient use of resources (including incentives for economical purchase and use of fuel and electric energy) by such electric utility, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such clause is reviewed not less often than every two years, in the manner described in paragraph (2), by the State regulatory authority having ratemaking authority with respect to such utility (or by the electric utility in the case of a nonregulated electric utility), to insure the maximum economies in those operations and purchases which affect the rates to which such clause applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a review under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) with respect to an electric utility, the reviewing authority shall examine and, if appropriate, cause to be audited the practices of such electric utility relating to costs subject to an automatic adjustment clause, and shall require such reports as may be necessary to carry out such review (including a disclosure of any ownership or corporate relationship between such electric utility and the seller to such utility of fuel, electric energy, or other items).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) As used in this subsection and section 2623(b) of this title, the term &ldquo;automatic adjustment clause&rdquo; means a provision of a rate schedule which provides for increases or decreases (or both), without prior hearing, in rates reflecting increases or decreases (or both) in costs incurred by an electric utility. Such term does not include an interim rate which takes effect subject to a later determination of the appropriate amount of the rate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Information to consumers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title, each electric utility shall transmit to each of its electric consumers a clear and concise explanation of the existing rate schedule and any rate schedule applied for (or proposed by a nonregulated electric utility) applicable to such consumer. Such statement shall be transmitted to each such consumer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not later than sixty days after the date of commencement of service to such consumer or ninety days after the standard established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title is adopted with respect to such electric utility, whichever last occurs, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not later than thirty days (sixty days in the case of an electric utility which uses a bimonthly billing system) after such utility's application for any change in a rate schedule applicable to such consumer (or proposal of such a change in the case of a nonregulated utility).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title, each electric utility shall transmit to each of its electric consumers not less frequently than once each year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a clear and concise summary of the existing rate schedules applicable to each of the major classes of its electric consumers for which there is a separate rate, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an identification of any classes whose rates are not summarized.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such summary may be transmitted together with such consumer's billing or in such other manner as the State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title, each electric utility, on request of an electric consumer of such utility, shall transmit to such consumer a clear and concise statement of the actual consumption (or degree-day adjusted consumption) of electric energy by such consumer for each billing period during the prior year (unless such consumption data is not reasonably ascertainable by the utility).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Procedures for termination of electric service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procedures for termination of service referred to in section 2623(b)(4) of this title are procedures prescribed by the State regulatory authority (with respect to electric utilities for which it has ratemaking authority) or by the nonregulated electric utility which provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no electric service to an electric consumer may be terminated unless reasonable prior notice (including notice of rights and remedies) is given to such consumer and such consumer has a reasonable opportunity to dispute the reasons for such termination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) during any period when termination of service to an electric consumer would be especially dangerous to health, as determined by the State regulatory authority (with respect to an electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility, and such consumer establishes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) he is unable to pay for such service in accordance with the requirements of the utility's billing, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) he is able to pay for such service but only in installments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such service may not be terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such procedures shall take into account the need to include reasonable provisions for elderly and handicapped consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Advertising</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section and section 2623(b)(5) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; means the commercial use, by an electric utility, of any media, including newspaper, printed matter, radio, and television, in order to transmit a message to a substantial number of members of the public or to such utility's electric consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;political advertising&rdquo; means any advertising for the purpose of influencing public opinion with respect to legislative, administrative, or electoral matters, or with re<!-- PDFPage:1989 -->spect to any controversial issue of public importance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;promotional advertising&rdquo; means any advertising for the purpose of encouraging any person to select or use the service or additional service of an electric utility or the selection or installation of any appliance or equipment designed to use such utility's service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection and section 2623(b)(5) of this title, the terms &ldquo;political advertising&rdquo; and &ldquo;promotional advertising&rdquo; do not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) advertising which informs electric consumers how they can conserve energy or can reduce peak demand for electric energy,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) advertising required by law or regulation, including advertising required under part 1 of title II of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 8211 et seq.],</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) advertising regarding service interruptions, safety measures, or emergency conditions,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) advertising concerning employment opportunities with such utility,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) advertising which promotes the use of energy efficient appliances, equipment or services, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) any explanation or justification of existing or proposed rate schedules, or notifications of hearings thereon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Time-based metering and communications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making a determination with respect to the standard established by section 2621(d)(14) of this title, the investigation requirement of section 2621(d)(14)(F) of this title shall be as follows: Each State regulatory authority shall conduct an investigation and issue a decision whether or not it is appropriate for electric utilities to provide and install time-based meters and communications devices for each of their customers which enable such customers to participate in time-based pricing rate schedules and other demand response programs.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Compensation for costs of participation or intervention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If no alternative means for assuring representation of electric consumers is adopted in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and if an electric consumer of an electric utility substantially contributed to the approval, in whole or in part, of a position advocated by such consumer in a proceeding concerning such utility, and relating to any standard set forth in subchapter II of this chapter, such utility shall be liable to compensate such consumer (pursuant to paragraph (2)) for reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs incurred in preparation and advocacy of such position in such proceeding (including fees and costs of obtaining judicial review of any determination made in such proceeding with respect to such position).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A consumer entitled to fees and costs under paragraph (1) may collect such fees and costs from an electric utility by bringing a civil action in any State court of competent jurisdiction, unless the State regulatory authority (in the case of a proceeding concerning a State regulated electric utility) or nonregulated electric utility (in the case of a proceeding concerning such nonregulated electric utility) has adopted a reasonable procedure pursuant to which such authority or nonregulated electric utility&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determines the amount of such fees and costs, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) includes an award of such fees and costs in its order in the proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The procedure adopted by such State regulatory authority or nonregulated utility under paragraph (2) may include a preliminary proceeding to require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as a condition of receiving compensation under such procedure such consumer demonstrate that, but for the ability to receive such award, participation or intervention in such proceeding may be a significant financial hardship for such consumer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) persons with the same or similar interests have a common legal representative in the proceeding as a condition to receiving compensation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Alternative means</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Compensation shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section if the State, the State regulatory authority (in the case of a proceeding concerning a State regulated electric utility), or the nonregulated electric utility (in the case of a proceeding concerning such nonregulated electric utility) has provided an alternative means for providing adequate compensation to persons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) who have, or represent, an interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which would not otherwise be adequately represented in the proceeding, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) representation of which is necessary for a fair determination in the proceeding, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) who are, or represent an interest which is, unable to effectively participate or intervene in the proceeding because such persons cannot afford to pay reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs of preparing for, and participating or intervening in, such proceeding (including fees and costs of obtaining judicial review of such proceeding).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may bring an action in any appropriate court of the United States to enforce his right to intervene and participate under section 2631(a) of this title, and such court shall have jurisdiction to grant appropriate relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any electric utility or electric consumer having a right to intervene under section 2631(a) of this title is denied such right by any State court, such electric utility or electric consumer may bring an action in the appropriate United States district court to require the State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility to permit such intervention and participation, and such court shall have jurisdiction to grant appropriate relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection prohibits any person bringing any action under this subsection in a court of the United States from seeking review and enforcement at any time in any State court of any rights he may have with respect to any motion to intervene or participate in any proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review and enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person (including the Secretary) may obtain review of any determination made under subchapter I or II of this chapter or under this subchapter with respect to any electric utility (other than a utility which is a Federal agency) in the appropriate State court if such person (or the Secretary) intervened or otherwise participated in the original proceeding or if State law otherwise permits such review. Any person (including the Secretary) may bring an action to enforce the requirements of this chapter in the appropriate State court, except that no such action may be brought in a State court with respect to a utility which is a Federal agency.
