<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Area included</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The park boundary is hereby modified to include approximately 107,600 acres as generally depicted on the map entitled &ldquo;Boundary Map, Everglades National Park Addition, Dade County, Florida&rdquo;, numbered 160&ndash;20,013B and dated September 1989. The map shall be on file and available for public inspection in the offices of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Boundary adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may from time to time make minor revisions in the boundaries of the park in accordance with section 460<em>l</em>&ndash;9(c) of this title. In exercising the boundary adjustment authority the Secretary shall ensure all actions will enhance resource preservation and shall not result in a net loss of acreage from the park.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acquisition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within the boundaries of the addition described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may acquire lands and interests in land by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. For purposes of acquiring property by exchange, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, exchange the approximately one acre of Federal land known as &ldquo;Gilberts&rsquo; Marina&rdquo; for non-Federal land of equal value located within the boundaries of the addition. Any lands or interests in land which are owned by the State of Florida or any political subdivision thereof, may be acquired only by donation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is the express intent of Congress that acquisition within the boundaries of the addition shall be completed not later than 5 years after December 13, 1989. The authority provided by this section shall remain in effect until all acquisition is completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Acquisition of tracts partially outside boundaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When any tract of land is only partly within boundaries referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may acquire all or any portion of the land outside of such boundaries in order to minimize the payment of severance <!-- PDFPage:267 -->costs. Land so acquired outside of the boundaries may be exchanged by the Secretary for non-Federal lands within the boundaries, and any land so acquired and not utilized for exchange shall be reported to the General Services Administration for disposal under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (63 Stat. 377) [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Offers to sell</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In exercising the authority to acquire property under sections 410r&ndash;5 to 410r&ndash;8 of this title, the Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by any person owning property within the boundaries of the addition to sell such property, if such owner notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership of such property is causing, or would result in undue hardship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), there are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of sections 410r&ndash;5 to 410r&ndash;8 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to land acquisition within the addition, not more than 80 percent of the cost of such acquisition may be provided by the Federal Government. Not less than 20 percent of such cost shall be provided by the State of Florida.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the request of the Governor of the State of Florida, the Secretary is authorized to provide technical assistance and personnel to assist in the acquisition of lands and waters within the Kissimmee River/Lake Okeechobee/Everglades Hydrologic Basin, including the Big Cypress Swamp, through the provision of Federal land acquisition personnel, practices, and procedures. The State of Florida shall reimburse the Secretary for such assistance in such amounts and at such time as agreed upon by the Secretary and the State. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, reimbursement received by the Secretary for such assistance shall be retained by the Secretary and shall be available without further appropriation for purposes of carrying out any authorized activity of the Secretary within the boundaries of the park.</p>
