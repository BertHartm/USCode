<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary shall maintain such list and shall annually transmit such list to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives until all of the State School lands identified in paragraph (1) have been acquired.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon the acquisition of all State School lands or upon notice by the Commission to the Secretary that it no longer has an interest in such lands or interests therein, such lands or interests shall be released to the agency that originally had jurisdiction over such lands or interests for disposal in accordance with the laws otherwise applicable to such lands or interests.</p>
