The guiding principle shall be to adjust the nature, capacity, and operating characteristics of works of improvement in a manner that (1) reflects the respective contributions of upstream and downstream works to flood protection and to the conservation, development, use, and disposal of water, and (2) provides the best use and control of water resources at minimum cost. Whenever approximately equivalent benefits can be obtained from alternative works of improvement, or combinations of improvements, with approximately the same cost the alternative or combination lease costly to the Federal Government shall be given preferential consideration. In case benefits are produced jointly by more than one work of improvement, or in case complementary relationships exist between the projects and plans of the several agencies, the benefits claimed in justification of a system of improvements shall not include any duplication or compounding of benefits.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Basic data</em>.
