<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After February 28, 1977, no foreign fishing is authorized within the exclusive economic zone, or for anadromous species or Continental Shelf fishery resources beyond the exclusive economic zone, unless such foreign fishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is authorized under subsections (b) or (c) of this section or section 1824(e) of this title, or under a permit issued under section 1824(d) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not prohibited under subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is conducted under, and in accordance with, a valid and applicable permit issued pursuant to section 1824 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Existing international fishery agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Foreign fishing described in subsection (a) of this section may be conducted pursuant to an international fishery agreement (subject to the provisions of section 1822(b) or (c) of this title), if such agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) was in effect on April 13, 1976; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has not expired, been renegotiated, or otherwise ceased to be of force and effect with respect to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Governing international fishery agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Foreign fishing described in subsection (a) of this section may be conducted pursuant to an international fishery agreement (other than a treaty) which meets the requirements of this subsection if such agreement becomes effective after application of section 1823 of this title. Any such international fishery agreement shall hereafter in this chapter be referred to as a &ldquo;governing international fishery agreement&rdquo;. Each governing international fishery agreement shall acknowledge the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, as set forth in this chapter. It is the sense of the Congress that each such agreement shall include a binding commitment, on the part of such foreign nation and its fishing vessels, to comply with the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The foreign nation, and the owner or operator of any fishing vessel fishing pursuant to such agreement, will abide by all regulations promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter, including any regulations promulgated to implement any applicable fishery management plan or any preliminary fishery management plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The foreign nation, and the owner or operator of any fishing vessel fishing pursuant to such agreement, will abide by the requirement that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any officer authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter (as provided for in section 1861 of this title) be permitted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to board, and search or inspect, any such vessel at any time,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to make arrests and seizures provided for in section 1861(b) of this title whenever such officer has reasonable cause to believe, as a result of such a search or inspection, that any such vessel or any person has committed an act prohibited by section 1857 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to examine and make notations on the permit issued pursuant to section 1824 of this title for such vessel;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the permit issued for any such vessel pursuant to section 1824 of this title be <!-- PDFPage:1826 -->prominently displayed in the wheelhouse of such vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) transponders, or such other appropriate position-fixing and identification equipment as the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating determines to be appropriate, be installed and maintained in working order on each such vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) United States observers required under subsection (h) of this section be permitted to be stationed aboard any such vessel and that all of the costs incurred incident to such stationing, including the costs of data editing and entry and observer monitoring, be paid for, in accordance with such subsection, by the owner or operator of the vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any fees required under section 1824(b)(10) of this title be paid in advance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) agents be appointed and maintained within the United States who are authorized to receive and respond to any legal process issued in the United States with respect to such owner or operator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) responsibility be assumed, in accordance with any requirements prescribed by the Secretary, for the reimbursement of United States citizens for any loss of, or damage to, their fishing vessels, fishing gear, or catch which is caused by any fishing vessel of that nation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and will abide by any other monitoring, compliance, or enforcement requirement related to fishery conservation and management which is included in such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The foreign nation and the owners or operators of all of the fishing vessels of such nation shall not, in any year, harvest an amount of fish which exceeds such nation's allocation of the total allowable level of foreign fishing, as determined under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The foreign nation will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) apply, pursuant to section 1824 of this title, for any required permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) deliver promptly to the owner or operator of the appropriate fishing vessel any permit which is issued under that section for such vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) abide by, and take appropriate steps under its own laws to assure that all such owners and operators comply with, section 1824(a) of this title and the applicable conditions and restrictions established under section 1824(b)(7) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) take, or refrain from taking, as appropriate, actions of the kind referred to in subsection (e)(1) of this section in order to receive favorable allocations under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Total allowable level of foreign fishing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total allowable level of foreign fishing, if any, with respect to any fishery subject to the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, shall be that portion of the optimum yield of such fishery which will not be harvested by vessels of the United States, as determined in accordance with this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allocation of allowable level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, may make allocations to foreign nations from the total allowable level of foreign fishing which is permitted with respect to each fishery subject to the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) From the determinations made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of State shall compute the aggregate of all of the fishery allocations made to each foreign nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary of State shall initially release to each foreign nation for harvesting up to 50 percent of the allocations aggregate computed for such nation under subparagraph (B), and such release of allocation shall be apportioned by the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, among the individual fishery allocations determined for that nation under subparagraph (A). The basis on which each apportionment is made under this subparagraph shall be stated in writing by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) After the initial release of fishery allocations under subparagraph (C) to a foreign nation, any subsequent release of an allocation for any fishery to such nation shall only be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) after the lapse of such period of time as may be sufficient for purposes of making the determination required under clause (ii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if the Secretary of State and the Secretary, after taking into account the size of the allocation for such fishery and the length and timing of the fishing season, determine in writing that such nation is complying with the purposes and intent of this paragraph with respect to such fishery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the foreign nation is not determined under clause (ii) to be in such compliance, the Secretary of State shall reduce, in a manner and quantity he considers to be appropriate (I) the remainder of such allocation, or (II) if all of such allocation has been released, the next allocation of such fishery, if any, made to such nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The determinations required to be made under subparagraphs (A) and (D)(ii), and the apportionments required to be made under subparagraph (C), with respect to a foreign nation shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) whether, and to what extent, such nation imposes tariff barriers or nontariff barriers on the importation, or otherwise restricts the market access, of both United States fish and fishery products, particularly fish and fishery products for which the foreign nation has requested an allocation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) whether, and to what extent, such nation is cooperating with the United States in both the advancement of existing and new opportunities for fisheries exports from the United States through the purchase of fishery products from United States processors, and the advancement of fisheries trade through the purchase of fish and fishery products from United States fishermen, particularly fish and fishery products for which the foreign nation has requested an allocation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) whether, and to what extent, such nation and the fishing fleets of such nation have cooperated with the United States in the enforcement of United States fishing regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) whether, and to what extent, such nation requires the fish harvested from the ex<!-- PDFPage:1827 -->clusive economic zone for its domestic consumption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) whether, and to what extent, such nation otherwise contributes to, or fosters the growth of, a sound and economic United States fishing industry, including minimizing gear conflicts with fishing operations of United States fishermen, and transferring harvesting or processing technology which will benefit the United States fishing industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) whether, and to what extent, the fishing vessels of such nation have traditionally engaged in fishing in such fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) whether, and to what extent, such nation is cooperating with the United States in, and making substantial contributions to, fishery research and the identification of fishery resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) such other matters as the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, deems appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For the purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The term &ldquo;certification&rdquo; means a certification made by the Secretary that nationals of a foreign country, directly or indirectly, are conducting fishing operations or engaging in trade or taking which diminishes the effectiveness of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. A certification under this section shall also be deemed a certification for the purposes of section 1978(a) of title 22.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term &ldquo;remedial period&rdquo; means the 365-day period beginning on the date on which a certification is issued with respect to a foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary issues a certification with respect to any foreign country, then each allocation under paragraph (1) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is in effect for that foreign country on the date of issuance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is not in effect on such date but would, without regard to this paragraph, be made to the foreign country within the remedial period;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be reduced by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, by not less than 50 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The following apply for purposes of administering subparagraph (B) with respect to any foreign country:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If on the date of certification, the foreign country has harvested a portion, but not all, of the quantity of fish specified under any allocation, the reduction under subparagraph (B) for that allocation shall be applied with respect to the quantity not harvested as of such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If the Secretary notified the Secretary of State that it is not likely that the certification of the foreign country will be terminated under section 1978(d) of title 22 before the close of the period for which an allocation is applicable or before the close of the remedial period (whichever close first occurs) the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, shall reallocate any portion of any reduction made under subparagraph (B) among one or more foreign countries for which no certification is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) If the certification is terminated under such section 1978(d) of title 22 during the remedial period, the Secretary of State shall return to the foreign country that portion of any allocation reduced under subparagraph (B) that was not reallocated under clause (ii); unless the harvesting of the fish covered by the allocation is otherwise prohibited under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The Secretary may refund or credit, by reason of reduction of any allocation under this paragraph, any fee paid under section 1824 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the certification of a foreign country is not terminated under section 1978(d) of title 22 before the close of the last day of the remedial period, the Secretary of State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to any allocation made to that country and in effect (as reduced under subparagraph (B)) on such last day, shall rescind, effective on and after the day after such last day, any unharvested portion of such allocation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) may not thereafter make any allocation to that country under paragraph (1) until the certification is terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reciprocity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Foreign fishing shall not be authorized for the fishing vessels of any foreign nation unless such nation satisfies the Secretary and the Secretary of State that such nation extends substantially the same fishing privileges to fishing vessels of the United States, if any, as the United States extends to foreign fishing vessels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Preliminary fishery management plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, when notified by the Secretary of State that any foreign nation has submitted an application under section 1824(b) of this title shall prepare a preliminary fishery management plan for any fishery covered by such application if the Secretary determines that no fishery management plan for that fishery will be prepared and implemented, pursuant to subchapter IV of this chapter, before March 1, 1977. To the extent practicable, each such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall contain a preliminary description of the fishery and a preliminary determination as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the optimum yield from such fishery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when appropriate, the capacity and extent to which United States fish processors will process that portion of such optimum yield that will be harvested by vessels of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total allowable level of foreign fishing with respect to such fishery;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall require each foreign fishing vessel engaged or wishing to engage in such fishery to obtain a permit from the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall require the submission of pertinent data to the Secretary, with respect to such fishery, as described in section 1853(a)(5) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may, to the extent necessary to prevent irreversible effects from overfishing, with respect to such fishery, contain conservation and management measures applicable to foreign fishing which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are determined to be necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of such fishery,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1828 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are consistent with the national standards, the other provisions of this chapter, and other applicable law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are described in section 1853(b)(2), (3), (4), (5), and (7) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Each preliminary fishery management plan shall be in effect with respect to foreign fishing for which permits have been issued until a fishery management plan is prepared and implemented, pursuant to subchapter IV of this chapter, with respect to such fishery. The Secretary may, in accordance with section 553 of title 5, also prepare and promulgate interim regulations with respect to any such preliminary plan. Such regulations shall be in effect until regulations implementing the applicable fishery management plan are promulgated pursuant to section 1855 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Full observer coverage program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall establish a program under which a United States observer will be stationed aboard each foreign fishing vessel while that vessel is engaged in fishing within the exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe minimum health and safety standards that shall be maintained aboard each foreign fishing vessel with regard to the facilities provided for the quartering of, and the carrying out of observer functions by, United States observers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The requirement in paragraph (1) that a United States observer be placed aboard each foreign fishing vessel may be waived by the Secretary if he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in a situation where a fleet of harvesting vessels transfers its catch taken within the exclusive economic zone to another vessel, aboard which is a United States observer, the stationing of United States observers on only a portion of the harvesting vessel fleet will provide a representative sampling of the by-catch of the fleet that is sufficient for purposes of determining whether the requirements of the applicable management plans for the by-catch species are being complied with;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a situation where the foreign fishing vessel is operating under a Pacific Insular Area fishing agreement, the Governor of the applicable Pacific Insular Area, in consultation with the Western Pacific Council, has established an observer coverage program that is at least equal in effectiveness to the program established by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the time during which a foreign fishing vessel will engage in fishing within the exclusive economic zone will be of such short duration that the placing of a United States observer aboard the vessel would be impractical; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) for reasons beyond the control of the Secretary, an observer is not available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Observers, while stationed aboard foreign fishing vessels, shall carry out such scientific, compliance monitoring, and other functions as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and shall cooperate in carrying out such other scientific programs relating to the conservation and management of living resources as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In addition to any fee imposed under section 1824(b)(10) of this title and section 1980(e) of title 22 with respect to foreign fishing for any year after 1980, the Secretary shall impose, with respect to each foreign fishing vessel for which a permit is issued under such section 1824 of this title, a surcharge in an amount sufficient to cover all the costs of providing a United States observer aboard that vessel. The failure to pay any surcharge imposed under this paragraph shall be treated by the Secretary as a failure to pay the permit fee for such vessel under section 1824(b)(10) of this title. All surcharges collected by the Secretary under this paragraph shall be deposited in the Foreign Fishing Observer Fund established by paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) There is established in the Treasury of the United States the Foreign Fishing Observer Fund. The Fund shall be available to the Secretary as a revolving fund for the purpose of carrying out this subsection. The Fund shall consist of the surcharges deposited into it as required under paragraph (4). All payments made by the Secretary to carry out this subsection shall be paid from the Fund, only to the extent and in the amounts provided for in advance in appropriation Acts. Sums in the Fund which are not currently needed for the purposes of this subsection shall be kept on deposit or invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If at any time the requirement set forth in paragraph (1) cannot be met because of insufficient appropriations, the Secretary shall, in implementing a supplementary observer program:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) certify as observers, for the purposes of this subsection, individuals who are citizens or nationals of the United States and who have the requisite education or experience to carry out the functions referred to in paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish standards of conduct for certified observers equivalent to those applicable to Federal personnel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) establish a reasonable schedule of fees that certified observers or their agents shall be paid by the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels for observer services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) monitor the performance of observers to ensure that it meets the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Recreational fishing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, foreign fishing vessels which are not operated for profit may engage in recreational fishing within the exclusive economic zone and the waters within the boundaries of a State subject to obtaining such permits, paying such reasonable fees, and complying with such conditions and restrictions as the Secretary and the Governor of the State (or his designee) shall impose as being necessary or appropriate to insure that the fishing activity of such foreign vessels within such zone or waters, respectively, is consistent with all applicable Federal and State laws and any applicable fishery management plan implemented under section 1854 of this title. The Secretary shall consult with the Sec<!-- PDFPage:1829 -->retary of State and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating in formulating the conditions and restrictions to be applied by the Secretary under the authority of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of State determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) he has been unable, within a reasonable period of time, to conclude with any foreign nation an international fishery agreement allowing fishing vessels of the United States equitable access to fisheries over which that nation asserts exclusive fishery management authority, including fisheries for tuna species, as recognized by the United States, in accordance with fishing activities of such vessels, if any, and under terms not more restrictive than those established under sections 1821(c) and (d) and 1824(b)(7) and (10) of this title, because such nation has (A) refused to commence negotiations, or (B) failed to negotiate in good faith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any foreign nation is not allowing fishing vessels of the United States to engage in fishing for tuna species in accordance with an applicable international fishery agreement, whether or not such nation is a party thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any foreign nation is not complying with its obligations under any existing international fishery agreement concerning fishing by fishing vessels of the United States in any fishery over which that nation asserts exclusive fishery management authority; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any fishing vessel of the United States, while fishing in waters beyond any foreign nation's territorial sea, to the extent that such sea is recognized by the United States, is seized by any foreign nation&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1846 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in violation of an applicable international fishery agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without authorization under an agreement between the United States and such nation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) as a consequence of a claim of jurisdiction which is not recognized by the United States;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1826. Large-scale driftnet fishing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section incorporates and expands upon provisions of the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 and may be cited as the &ldquo;Driftnet Act Amendments of 1990&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the continued widespread use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation is a destructive fishing practice that poses a threat to living marine resources of the world's oceans, including but not limited to the North and South Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the use of large-scale driftnets is expanding into new regions of the world's oceans, including the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a pressing need for detailed and reliable information on the number of seabirds, sea turtles, nontarget fish, and marine mammals that become entangled and die in actively fished large-scale driftnets and in large-scale driftnets that are lost, abandoned, or discarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increased efforts, including reliable observer data and enforcement mechanisms, are needed to monitor, assess, control, and reduce the adverse impact of large-scale driftnet fishing on living marine resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the nations of the world have agreed in the United Nations, through General Assembly Resolution Numbered 44&ndash;225, approved December 22, 1989, by the General Assembly, that a moratorium should be imposed by June 30, 1992, on the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the nations of the South Pacific have agreed to a moratorium on the use of large-scale driftnets in the South Pacific through the Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific, which was agreed to in Wellington, New Zealand, on November 29, 1989; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) increasing population pressures and new knowledge of the importance of living marine resources to the health of the global ecosystem demand that greater responsibility be exercised by persons fishing or developing new fisheries beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared to be the policy of the Congress in this section that the United States should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) implement the moratorium called for by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution Numbered 44&ndash;225;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) support the Tarawa Declaration and the Wellington Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) secure a permanent ban on the use of destructive fishing practices, and in particular large-scale driftnets, by persons or vessels fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) International agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, through the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall seek to secure international agreements to implement immediately the findings, policy, and provisions of this section, and in particular an international ban on large-scale driftnet fishing. The Secretary, through the Secretary of State, shall include, in any agreement which addresses the taking of living marine resources of the United States, provisions to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1847 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) each large-scale driftnet fishing vessel of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement, including vessels that may operate independently to develop new fishing areas, which operate beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is included in such agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) each large-scale driftnet fishing vessel of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement, which operates beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is equipped with satellite transmitters which provide real-time position information accessible to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) statistically reliable monitoring by the United States is carried out, through the use of on-board observers or through dedicated platforms provided by foreign nations that are parties to the agreement, of all target and nontarget fish species, marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds entangled or killed by large-scale driftnets used by fishing vessels of foreign nations that are parties to the agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) officials of the United States have the right to board and inspect for violations of the agreement any large-scale driftnet fishing vessels operating under the flag of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement at any time while such vessel is operating in designated areas beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) all catch landed or transshipped at sea by large-scale driftnet fishing vessels of a foreign nation that is a party to the agreement, and which are operated beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is reliably monitored and documented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) time and area restrictions are imposed on the use of large-scale driftnets in order to prevent interception of anadromous species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) all large-scale driftnets used are constructed, insofar as feasible, with biodegradable materials which break into segments that do not represent a threat to living marine resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) all large-scale driftnets are marked at appropriate intervals in a manner that conclusively identifies the vessel and flag nation responsible for each such driftnet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the taking of nontarget fish species, marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds, and endangered species or other species protected by international agreements to which the United States is a party is minimized and does not pose a threat to existing fisheries or the long-term health of living marine resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) definitive steps are agreed upon to ensure that parties to the agreement comply with the spirit of other international agreements and resolutions concerning the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than January 1, 1991, and every year thereafter until the purposes of this section are met, the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) describing the steps taken to carry out the provisions of this section, particularly subsection (c) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) evaluating the progress of those efforts, the impacts on living marine resources, including available observer data, and specifying plans for further action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) containing a list and description of any new fisheries developed by nations that conduct, or authorize their nationals to conduct, large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) containing a list of the nations that conduct, or authorize their nationals to conduct, large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation in a manner that diminishes the effectiveness of or is inconsistent with any international agreement governing large-scale driftnet fishing to which the United States is a party or otherwise subscribes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If at any time the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, identifies any nation that warrants inclusion in the list described under subsection (e)(4) of this section, the Secretary shall certify that fact to the President. Such certification shall be deemed to be a certification for the purposes of section 1978(a) of title 22.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect on sovereign rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not serve or be construed to expand or diminish the sovereign rights of the United States, as stated by Presidential Proclamation Numbered 5030, dated March 10, 1983, and reflected in this chapter or other existing law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &ldquo;Living marine resources&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;living marine resources&rdquo; includes fish, marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds and other waterfowl.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 102&ndash;582, as amended by Pub. L. 104&ndash;208, div. A, title I, &sect;101(a) [title II, &sect;211(b)], Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009&ndash;41, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas is highly destructive to the living marine resources and ocean ecosystems of the world's oceans, including anadromous fish and other living marine resources of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The cumulative effects of large-scale driftnet fishing pose a significant threat to the marine ecosystem, and slow-reproducing species like marine mammals, sharks, and seabirds may require many years to recover.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Members of the international community have reviewed the best available scientific data on the impacts of large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing, and have failed to conclude that this practice has no significant adverse impacts which threaten the conservation and sustainable management of living marine resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United Nations, via General Assembly Resolutions numbered 44&ndash;225, 45&ndash;197, and most recently 46&ndash;215 (adopted on December 20, 1991), has called for a worldwide moratorium on all high seas driftnet fishing by December 31, 1992, in all the world's oceans, including enclosed seas and semi-enclosed seas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The United Nations has commended the unilateral, regional, and international efforts undertaken by members of the international community and international organizations to implement and support the objectives of the General Assembly resolutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Operative paragraph (4) of United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46&ndash;215 specifically &lsquo;encourages all members of the international community to take measures individually and collectively to prevent large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing operations on the high seas of the world's oceans and seas&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The United States, in section 307(1)(M) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857(1)(M)), has specifically prohibited the practice of large-scale driftnet fishing by United States nationals and vessels both within the exclusive economic zone of the United States and beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Senate, through Senate Resolution 396 of the One Hundredth Congress (approved on March 18, 1988), has called for a moratorium on fishing in the Central Bering Sea and the United States has taken concrete steps to implement such moratorium through international negotiations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Despite the continued evidence of a decline in the fishery resources of the Bering Sea and the multiyear cooperative negotiations undertaken by the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan, and other concerned fishing nations, some nations refuse to agree to measures to reduce or eliminate unregulated fishing practices in the waters of the Bering Sea beyond the exclusive economic zones of the United States and the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) In order to ensure that the global moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing called for in United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46&ndash;215 takes effect by December 31, 1992, and that unregulated fishing practices in the waters of the Central Bering Sea are reduced or eliminated, the United States should take the actions described in this Act [see Short Title of 1992 Amendments note set out under section 1801 of this title] and encourage other nations to take similar action.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the stated policy of the United States to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) implement United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46&ndash;215, approved unanimously on December 20, 1991, which calls for an immediate cessation to further expansion of large-scale driftnet fishing, a 50 percent reduction in existing large-scale driftnet fishing effort by June 30, 1992, and a global moratorium on the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation by December 31, 1992;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) bring about a moratorium on fishing in the Central Bering Sea, or an international conservation and management agreement to which the United States and the Russian Federation are parties that regulates fishing in the Central Bering Sea; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) secure a permanent ban on the use of destructive fishing practices, and in particular large-scale driftnets, by persons or vessels fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.&rdquo;</p>
