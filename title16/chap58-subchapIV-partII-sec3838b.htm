<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Incentives</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the 1991 through 1995 calendar years, the Secretary shall formulate and carry out a voluntary incentive program, in accordance with this part, through agreements to assist owners and operators of a farm in developing and implementing a water quality protection plan pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall enter into agreements of 3 to 5 years upon the request of owners and operators of farms in eligible areas but shall not enter into any such agreements after December 31, 1995.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Duties of owners and operators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to receive annual incentive payments, an owner or operator of a farm must agree&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to conduct any practices on the farm that would tend to defeat the purposes of this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to comply with such additional provisions as the Secretary determines are desirable and are included in the agreement to carry out the water quality protection plan or to facilitate the practical administration of the program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) on the violation of a term or condition of the agreement at any time the owner or operator has control of the land to refund any incentive or cost share payment received with interest and forfeit any such future payments as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) on the transfer of the right and interest of the owner or operator in land subject to the agreement, unless the transferee of such right and interest agrees with the Secretary to assume all obligations of the agreement, to refund any such cost share and incentive payments received under this part, as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to accurately report nutrient, pesticide and animal waste materials usage rates on management areas for three previous years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) to supply production evidence, well test results, soil tests, tissue tests, nutrient application levels, pesticide application levels, and animal waste material usage levels, to the Soil Conservation Service or another designee of the Secretary including the local conservation district for each year of the agreement, as determined necessary by the Secretary.</p>

The Secretary shall develop procedures for approving such agricultural practices, as a part of and consistent with the objectives of the water quality protection plan, that qualify for cost share assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Wetland preservation and wildlife habitat improvement options</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Wetland preservation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) providing technical assistance in developing and implementing agricultural water quality protection plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) providing an annual incentive payment for developing and implementing agricultural production practices in accordance with an approved water quality protection plan submitted by the owner or operator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) providing cost share assistance for implementing the wetland preservation or wildlife habitat improvement options;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) providing participants with information, education, and training to aid in implementation of a plan; and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Incentive</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the amount of incentive payment to be made to a participant under this part, the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the amount necessary on a per acre basis to encourage producers to participate, additional costs incurred by the producer, and the production values forgone, if any, in implementing the practices.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Cost share payments shall be made in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the cost of the eligible practice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to facilitate the practical administration of this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to achieve such other goals as the Secretary determines are appropriate, consistent with this part.</p>
