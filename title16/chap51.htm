<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to preserve for the benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations certain lands and waters in the State of Alaska that contain nationally significant natural, scenic, historic, archeological, geological, scientific, wilderness, cultural, recreational, and wildlife values, the units described in the following titles are hereby established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preservation and protection of scenic, geological, etc., values</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intent of Congress in this Act to preserve unrivaled scenic and geological values associated with natural landscapes; to provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation, including those species dependent on vast relatively undeveloped areas; to preserve in their natural state extensive unaltered arctic tundra, boreal forest, and coastal rainforest ecosystems; to protect the resources related to subsistence needs; to protect and preserve historic and archeological sites, rivers, and lands, and to preserve wilderness resource values and related recreational opportunities including but not limited to hiking, canoeing, fishing, and sport hunting, within large arctic and subarctic wildlands and on freeflowing rivers; and to maintain opportunities for scientific research and undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Subsistence way of life for rural residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further the intent and purpose of this Act consistent with management of fish and wildlife in accordance with recognized scientific principles and the purposes for which each conservation system unit is established, designated, or expanded by or pursuant to this Act, to provide the opportunity for rural residents engaged in a subsistence way of life to continue to do so.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1952 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Need for future legislation obviated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This Act provides sufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic, natural, cultural and environmental values on the public lands in Alaska, and at the same time provides adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its people; accordingly, the designation and disposition of the public lands in Alaska pursuant to this Act are found to represent a proper balance between the reservation of national conservation system units and those public lands necessary and appropriate for more intensive use and disposition, and thus Congress believes that the need for future legislation designating new conservation system units, new national conservation areas, or new national recreation areas, has been obviated thereby.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Changes in land management status; publication in Federal Register; filing; clerical errors; boundary features and adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after December 2, 1980, a map and legal description of each change in land management status effected by this Act, including the National Wilderness Preservation System, shall be published in the Federal Register and filed with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, and each such description shall have the same force and effect as if included in this Act: <em>Provided, however</em>, That correction of clerical and typographical errors in each such legal description and map may be made.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the continuation of the opportunity for subsistence uses by rural residents of Alaska, including both Natives and non-Natives, on the public lands and by Alaska Natives on Native lands is essential to Native physical, economic, traditional, and cultural existence and to non-Native physical, economic, traditional, and social existence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the situation in Alaska is unique in that, in most cases, no practical alternative means are available to replace the food supplies and other items gathered from fish and wildlife which supply rural residents dependent on subsistence uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) continuation of the opportunity for subsistence uses of resources on public and other lands in Alaska is threatened by the increasing population of Alaska, with resultant pressure on subsistence resources, by sudden decline in the populations of some wildlife species which are crucial subsistence resources, by increased accessibility of remote areas containing subsistence resources, and by taking of fish and wildlife in a manner inconsistent with recognized principles of fish and wildlife management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in order to fulfill the policies and purposes of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] and as a matter of equity, it is necessary for the Congress to invoke its constitutional authority over Native affairs and its constitutional authority under the property clause and the commerce clause to protect and provide the opportunity for continued subsistence uses on the public lands by Native and non-Native rural residents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the national interest in the proper regulation, protection, and conservation of fish <!-- PDFPage:1955 -->and wildlife on the public lands in Alaska and the continuation of the opportunity for a subsistence way of life by residents of rural Alaska require that an administrative structure be established for the purpose of enabling rural residents who have personal knowledge of local conditions and requirements to have a meaningful role in the management of fish and wildlife and of subsistence uses on the public lands in Alaska.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the review and evaluation of proposals for regulations, policies, management plans, and other matters relating to subsistence uses of fish and wildlife within the region;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the provision of a forum for the expression of opinions and recommendations by persons interested in any matter related to subsistence uses of fish and wildlife within the region;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the encouragement of local and regional participation pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in the decisionmaking process affecting the taking of fish and wildlife on the public lands within the region for subsistence uses;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consideration of reports and recommendations of regional advisory councils</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in performing his monitoring responsibility pursuant to section 3116 of this title and in the exercise of his closure and other administrative authority over the public lands, shall consider the report and recommendations of the regional advisory councils concerning the taking of fish and wildlife on the public lands within their respective regions for subsistence uses. The Secretary may choose not to follow any recommendation which he determines is not supported by substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and wildlife conservation, or would be detrimental to the satisfaction of subsistence needs. If a recommendation is not adopted by the Secretary, he shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for his decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not implement subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section if the State enacts and implements laws of general applicability which are consistent with, and which provide for the definition, preference, and participation specified in, sections 3113, 3114, and 3115 of this title, such laws, unless and until repealed, shall supersede such sections insofar as such sections govern State responsibility pursuant to this subchapter for the taking of fish and wildlife on the public lands for subsistence uses. Laws establishing a system of local advisory committees and regional advisory councils consistent with this section shall provide that the State rulemaking authority shall consider the advice and recommendations of the regional councils concerning the taking of fish and wildlife populations on public lands within their respective regions for subsistence uses. The regional councils may present recommendations, and the evidence upon which such recommendations are based, to the State rulemaking authority during the course of the administrative proceedings of such authority. The State rulemaking authority may choose not to follow any recommendation which it determines is not supported by substantial evidence presented during the course of its administrative proceedings, violates recognized principles of fish and wildlife conservation or would be detrimental to the satisfaction of rural subsistence needs. If a recommendation is not adopted by the State rulemaking authority, such authority shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for its decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement to State; limitation; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall reimburse the State, from funds appropriated to the Department of the Interior for such purposes, for reasonable costs relating to the establishment and operation of the regional advisory councils established by the State in accordance with subsection (d) of this section and the operation of the State fish and game advisory committees so long as such committees are not superseded by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section. Such reimbursement may not exceed 50 per centum of such costs in any fiscal year. Such costs shall be verified in a statement which the Secretary determines to be adequate and accurate. Sums paid under this subsection shall be in addition to any grants, payments, or other sums to which the State is entitled from appropriations to the Department of the Interior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Total payments to the State under this subsection shall not exceed the sum of $5,000,000 in any one fiscal year. The Secretary shall advise the Congress at least once in every five years as to whether or not the maximum payments specified in this subsection are adequate to ensure the effectiveness of the program established by the State to provide the preference for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife set forth in section 3114 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3142. Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain resource assessment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to provide for a comprehensive and continuing inventory and assessment of the fish and wildlife resources of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; an analysis of the impacts of oil and gas exploration, development, and production, and to authorize exploratory activity within the coastal plain in a manner that avoids significant adverse effects on the fish and wildlife and other resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;coastal plain&rdquo; means that area identified as such in the map entitled &ldquo;Arctic National Wildlife Refuge&rdquo;, dated August 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;exploratory activity&rdquo; means surface geological exploration or seismic exploration, or both, for oil and gas within the coastal plain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Baseline study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with the Governor of the State, Native Village and Regional Corporations, and the North Slope Borough within the study area and interested persons, shall conduct a continuing study of the fish and wildlife (with special emphasis on caribou, wolves, wolverines, grizzly bears, migratory waterfowl, musk oxen, and polar bears) of the coastal plain and their habitat. In conducting the study, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) assess the size, range, and distribution of the populations of the fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determine the extent, location and carrying capacity of the habitats of the fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) assess the impacts of human activities and natural processes on the fish and wildlife and their habitats;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) analyze the potential impacts of oil and gas exploration, development, and production on such wildlife and habitats; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) analyze the potential effects of such activities on the culture and lifestyle (including subsistence) of affected Native and other people.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Within eighteen months after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall publish the results of the study as of that date and shall thereafter publish such revisions thereto as are appropriate as new information is obtained.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within two years after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall by regulation establish initial guidelines governing the carrying out of exploratory activities. The guidelines shall be based upon the results of the study required under subsection (c) of this section and such other information as may be available to the Secretary. The guidelines shall include such prohibitions, restrictions, and conditions on the carrying out of exploratory activities as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate to ensure that exploratory activities do not significantly adversely affect the fish and wildlife, <!-- PDFPage:1964 -->their habitats, or the environment, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a prohibition on the carrying out of exploratory activity during caribou calving and immediate post-calving seasons or during any other period in which human activity may have adverse effects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) temporary or permanently closing of appropriate areas to such activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specification of the support facilities, equipment and related manpower that is appropriate in connection with exploratory activity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) requirements that exploratory activities be coordinated in such a manner as to avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The initial guidelines prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection shall be accompanied by an environmental impact statement on exploratory activities. The initial guidelines shall thereafter be revised to reflect changes made in the baseline study and other appropriate information made available to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exploration plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After the initial guidelines are prescribed under subsection (d) of this section, any person including the United States Geological Survey may submit one or more plans for exploratory activity (hereinafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;exploration plans&rdquo;) to the Secretary for approval. An exploration plan must set forth such information as the Secretary may require in order to determine whether the plan is consistent with the guidelines, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description and schedule of the exploratory activity proposed to be undertaken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of the equipment, facilities, and related manpower that would be used in carrying out the activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the area in which the activity would be undertaken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a statement of the anticipated effects that the activity may have on fish and wildlife, their habitats and the environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon receiving any exploration plan for approval, the Secretary shall promptly publish notice of the application and the text of the plan in the Federal Register and newspapers of general circulation in the State. The Secretary shall determine, within one hundred and twenty days after any plan is submitted for approval, if the plan is consistent with the guidelines established under subsection (d) of this section. If the Secretary determines that the plan is so consistent, he shall approve the plan: except that no plan shall be approved during the two-year period following December 2, 1980. Before making the determination, the Secretary shall hold at least one public hearing in the State for purposes of receiving the comments and views of the public on the plan. The Secretary shall not approve of any plan submitted by the United States Geological Survey unless he determines that (1) no other person has submitted a plan for the area involved which meets established guidelines and (2) the information which would be obtained is needed to make an adequate report under subsection (h) of this section. The Secretary, as a condition of approval of any plan under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may require that such modifications be made to the plan as he considers necessary and appropriate to make it consistent with the guidelines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall require that all data and information (including processed, analyzed and interpreted information) obtained as a result of carrying out the plan shall be submitted to the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall make such data and information available to the public except that any processed, analyzed and interpreted data or information shall be held confidential by the Secretary for a period of not less than two years following any lease sale including the area from which the information was obtained and: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall prohibit by regulation any person who obtains access to such data and information from the Secretary or from any person other than a permittee from participation in any lease sale which includes the areas from which the information was obtained and from any commercial use of the information. The Secretary shall require that any permittee shall make available such data to any person at fair cost.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Modification to exploration plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If at any time while exploratory activity is being carried out under an exploration plan approved under subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary, on the basis of information available to him, determines that continuation of further activities under the plan or permit will significantly adversely affect fish or wildlife, their habitat, or the environment, the Secretary may suspend the carrying out of activities under the plan or permit for such time, make such modifications to the plan or to the terms and conditions of the permit (or both suspend and so modify) as he determines necessary and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Civil penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have violated any provision of a plan approved under subsection (e) of this section or any term or condition of a permit issued under subsection (f) of this section, or to have committed any act prohibited under subsection (d) of this section shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $10,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited act committed, and, with respect to the violator, the history of any prior offenses, his demonstrated good faith in attempting to achieve timely compliance after being cited for the violation, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under paragraph (1) may obtain review thereof in the appropriate district court of the <!-- PDFPage:1965 -->United States by filing a notice of appeal in such court within thirty days from the date of such order and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such penalty imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court if they are not found to be supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2)(E) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty against him under paragraph (1) after it has become final, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under this subsection unless the matter is pending in court for judicial review or recovery of assessment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not earlier than five years after December 2, 1980, and not later than five years and nine months after such date, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to Congress a report containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the identification by means other than drilling of exploratory wells of those areas within the coastal plain that have oil and gas production potential and estimate of the volume of the oil and gas concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the description of the fish and wildlife, their habitats, and other resources that are within the areas identified under paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an evaluation of the adverse effects that the carrying out of further exploration for, and the development and production of, oil and gas within such areas will have on the resources referred to in paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of how such oil and gas, if produced within such area, may be transported to processing facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an evaluation of how such oil and gas relates to the national need for additional domestic sources of oil and gas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the recommendations of the Secretary with respect to whether further exploration for, and the development and production of, oil and gas within the coastal plain should be permitted and, if so, what additional legal authority is necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of such activities on fish and wildlife, their habitats, and other resources are avoided or minimized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Effect of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until otherwise provided for in law enacted after December 2, 1980, all public lands within the coastal plain are withdrawn from all forms of entry or appropriation under the mining laws, and from operation of the mineral leasing laws, of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment; restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish, pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], an oil and gas leasing program on the Federal lands of Alaska not subject to the study required by section 3141 of this title, other than lands included in the National Petroleum Reserve&mdash;Alaska. Such program shall not be undertaken by the Secretary on those lands where applicable law prohibits such leasing or on those units of the National Wildlife Refuge System where the Secretary determines, after having considered the national interest in producing oil and gas from such lands, that the exploration for and development of oil or gas would be incompatible with the purpose for which such unit was established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Study of oil and gas potential and impact of development and production; permits; consultations; State studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In such areas as the Secretary deems favorable for the discovery of oil or gas, he shall conduct a study, or studies, or collect and analyze information obtained by permittees authorized to conduct studies under this section, of the oil and gas potential of such lands and those environmental characteristics and wildlife resources which would be affected by the exploration for and development of such oil and gas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary is authorized to issue permits for study, including geological, geophysical, and other assessment activities, if such activities can be conducted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes for which each affected area is managed under applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Energy regarding the national interest involved in exploring for and developing oil and gas from such lands and shall seek the views of the Governor of the State of Alaska, Alaskan local governments, Native Regional and Village Corporations, the Alaska Land Use Council, representatives of the oil and gas industry, conservation groups, and other interested groups and individuals in determining which land should be studied and/or leased for the exploration and development of oil and gas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall encourage the State to undertake similar studies on lands associated, <!-- PDFPage:1968 -->either through geological or other land values or because of possible transportation needs, with Federal lands. The Secretary shall integrate these studies, to the maximum extent practicable, with studies on Federal lands so that needs for cooperation between the Federal Government and the State of Alaska in managing energy and other natural resources, including fish and wildlife, can be established early in the program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Subsequent to a discovery of oil or gas in paying quantities, and prior to developing and producing such oil and gas, the Secretary shall require the lessee to describe development and production activities in a development and production plan. He shall approve such plan if such activities may be conducted in conformity with such requirements as may be made by the Secretary for the protection and use of the land for the purpose for which it is managed under applicable law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Revised development and production plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall monitor the performance of the lessee and, if he determines that due to significant changes in circumstances regarding that operation, including environmental or economic changes, new requirements are needed, he may require a revised development and production plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Suspension and cancellation of lease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that immediate and irreparable damage will result from continuation in force of a lease, that the threat will not disappear and that the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuation in force of a lease, he shall suspend operations for up to five years. If such a threat persists beyond such five-year suspension period, he shall cancel a lease and provide compensation to the lease under such terms as the Secretary establishes, by regulation, to be appropriate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Mineral assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, to the full extent of his authority, assess the oil, gas, and other mineral potential on all public lands in the State of Alaska in order to expand the data base with respect to the mineral potential of such lands. The mineral assessment program may include, but shall not be limited to, techniques such as side-looking radar imagery and, on public lands other than such lands within the national park system, core and test drilling for geologic information, notwithstanding any restriction on such drilling under the Wilderness Act [16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.]. For purposes of this Act, core and test drilling means the extraction by drilling of subsurface geologic samples in order to assess the metalliferous or other mineral values of geologic terrain, but shall not be construed as including exploratory drilling of oil and gas test wells. To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall consult and exchange information with the State of Alaska regarding the responsibilities of the Secretary under this section and similar programs undertaken by the State. In order to carry out mineral assessments authorized under this or any other law, including but not limited to the National Uranium Resource Evaluation program, the Secretary shall allow for access by air for assessment activities permitted in this subsection to all public lands involved in such study. He shall consult with the Secretary of Energy and heads of other Federal agencies carrying out such programs, to determine such reasonable requirements as may be necessary to protect the resources of such area, including fish and wildlife. Such requirements may provide that access will not occur during nesting, calving, spawning or such other times as fish and wildlife in the specific area may be especially vulnerable to such activities. The Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts with public or private entities to carry out all or any portion of the mineral assessment program. This section shall not apply to the lands described in section 3141 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Activities carried out in conservation system units under subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Such regulations shall ensure that such activities are carried out in an environmentally sound manner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which does not result in lasting environmental impacts which appreciably alter the natural character of the units or biological or ecological systems in the units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which is compatible with the purposes for which such units are established.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3164. Procedural requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of applicable law, no action by any Federal agency under applicable law with respect to the approval or disapproval of the authorization, in whole or in part, of any transportation or utility system shall have any force or effect unless the provision of this section are complied with.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consolidated applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within one hundred and eighty days after December 2, 1980, the Secretary, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, shall jointly prescribe and publish a consolidated application form to be used for applying for the approval of each type of transportation or utility system. Each such application form shall be designed to elicit such information as may be necessary to meet the requirements of this subchapter and the applicable law with respect to the type of system concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this section, the heads of all appropriate Federal agencies, including the Secretary of Transportation, shall share decisionmaking responsibility in the case of any transportation or utility system described in section 3162(4)(B)(ii), (iii), or (vii) of this title; but with respect to any such system for which he does not have programmatic responsibility, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide to the other Federal agencies concerned such planning and other assistance as may be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each applicant for the approval of any transportation or utility system shall file on the same day an application with each appropriate Federal agency. The applicant shall utilize the consolidated form prescribed under subsection (b) of this section for the type of transportation or utility system concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Agency notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within sixty days after the receipt of an application filed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the head of each Federal agency with whom the application was filed shall inform the applicant in writing that, on its face&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the application appears to contain the information required by this subchapter and applicable law insofar as that agency is concerned; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the application does not contain such information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any notice provided under paragraph (1)(B) shall specify what additional information the <!-- PDFPage:1971 -->applicant must provide. If the applicant provides additional information, the head of the Federal agency must inform the applicant in writing, within thirty days after receipt of such information, whether the information is sufficient.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Environmental impact statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The draft of any environmental impact statement required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] in connection with any application filed under this section shall be completed, within nine months from the date of filing, by the head of the Federal agency assigned lead responsibility for the statement. Any such statement shall be jointly prepared by all Federal agencies with which the application was filed under subsection (c) of this section. The final environmental impact statement shall be completed within one year from the date of such filing. Such nine-month and one-year periods may be extended for good cause by the Federal agency head assigned lead responsibility for the preparation of such statement if he determines that additional time is necessary for such preparation, notifies the applicant in writing of such determination, and publishes notices of such determination, together with the reasons therefor, in the Federal Register. The provisions of section 1734 of title 43 shall apply to each environmental impact statement under this subsection in the same manner as such provisions apply to applications relating to the public lands referred to in section 1734 of title 43. The Federal agency assigned lead responsibility shall, in conjunction with such other Federal agencies before which the application is pending, hold public hearings in the District of Columbia and an appropriate location in the State on each draft joint environmental impact statement and the views expressed therein shall be considered by all Federal agencies concerned before publication of the final joint environmental impact statement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Other views</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During both the nine-month period, and the succeeding three-month period plus any extension thereof provided for in subsection (e) of this section, the heads of the Federal agencies concerned shall solicit and consider the views of other Federal departments and agencies, the Alaska Land Use Council, the State, affected units of local government in the State, and affected corporations formed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], and, after public notice, shall receive and consider statements and recommendations regarding the application submitted by interested individuals and organizations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Agency decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within four months after the final environmental impact statement is published in accordance with subsection (e) of this section with respect to any transportation or utility system, each Federal agency shall make a decision to approve or disapprove, in accordance with applicable law, each authorization and that applies with respect to the system and that is within the jurisdiction of that agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of each Federal agency, in making a decision referred to in paragraph (1), shall consider, and make detailed findings supported by substantial evidence, with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the need for, and economic feasibility of, the transportation or utility system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) alternative routes and modes of access, including a determination with respect to whether there is any economically feasible and prudent alternative to the routing of the system through or within a conservation system unit, national recreation area, or national conservation area and, if not, whether there are alternative routes or modes which would result in fewer or less severe adverse impacts upon the conservation system unit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the feasibility and impacts of including different transportation or utility systems in the same area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) short- and long-term social, economic, and environmental impacts of national, State, or local significance, including impacts on fish and wildlife and their habitat, and on rural, traditional lifestyles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the impacts, if any, on the national security interests of the United States, that may result from approval or denial of the application for a transportation or utility system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) any impacts that would affect the purposes for which the Federal unit or area concerned was established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) measures which should be instituted to avoid or minimize negative impacts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) the short- and long-term public values which may be adversely affected by approval of the transportation or utility system versus the short- and long-term public benefits which may accrue from such approval.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any application for the approval of any transportation or utility system to which section 3165 of this title does not apply or that does not occupy, use, or traverse any area within the National Wilderness Preservation System, if, in compliance with section 3164 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each Federal agency concerned decides to approve each authorization within its jurisdiction with respect to that system, then the system shall be deemed to be approved and each such agency shall promptly issue, in accordance with applicable law, such rights-of-way, permits, licenses, leases, certificates, or other authorizations as are necessary with respect to the establishment of the system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) one or more Federal agencies decide to disapprove any authorization within its jurisdiction with respect, to that system, then the system shall be deemed to be disapproved and the applicant for the system may appeal the disapproval to the President.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an applicant appeals under paragraph (1)(B), the President, within four months after receiving the appeal, shall decide whether to approve or deny the application. The President shall approve the application if he finds, after consideration of the factors set forth in section 3164(g)(2) of this title, that such approval would be in the public interest and that (1) such system would be compatible with the purposes for which the unit was established; and (2) there is no economically feasible and prudent alternative route for the system. In making a decision, the President shall consider any environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to section 3164(e) of this title, comments of the public and Federal agencies received during the preparation of such statement, and the findings and recommendations, if any, of each Federal agency that rendered a decision with respect to the application. The President's decision to approve or deny the application shall be published in the Federal Register, together with a statement of the reasons for his determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the President approves an application under paragraph (2), each Federal agency concerned shall promptly issue, in accordance with applicable law, such rights-of-way, permits, licenses, leases, certificates, or other authorizations as are necessary with respect to the establishment of the system</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the President denies an application under paragraph (2), the applicant shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies and may file suit in any appropriate Federal court to challenge such decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agency action in cases involving section 3165 or wilderness areas</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Secretary is authorized, consistent with other applicable law in order to carry out the purposes of this Act, to acquire by purchase, donation, exchange, or otherwise any lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit other than National Forest Wilderness.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Lands located within the boundaries of a conservation system unit which are owned by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State or a political subdivision of the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a Native Corporation or Native Group which has Natives as a majority of its stockholders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the actual occupant of a tract, title to the surface estate of which was on, before, or after December 2, 1980, conveyed to such occupant pursuant to section 1613(c)(1) and (h)(5) of title 43, unless the Secretary determines that the tract is no longer occupied for the purpose described in section 1613(c)(1) or (h)(5) of title 43 for which the tract was conveyed and that activities on the tract are or will be detrimental to the purposes of the unit in which the tract is located; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">may not be acquired by the Secretary without the consent of the owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Lands located within the boundaries of a conservation system unit (other than National Forest Wilderness) which are owned by persons or entities other than those described in subsection (b) of this section shall not be acquired by the Secretary without the consent of the owner unless prior to final judgment on the value of the acquired land, the owner, after being offered appropriate land of similar characteristics and like value (if such land is available from public lands located outside the boundaries of any conservation system unit), chooses not to accept the exchange. In identifying public lands for exchange pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Alaska Land Use Council.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Improved property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No improved property shall be acquired under subsection (a) of this section without the consent of the owner unless the Secretary first determines that such acquisition is necessary to the fulfillment of the purposes of this Act or to the fulfillment of the purposes for which the concerned conservation system unit was established or expanded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Retained rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner of an improved property on the date of its acquisition, as a condition of such acquisition, may retain for himself, his heirs and assigns, a right of use and occupance of the improved property for noncommercial residential or recreational purposes, as the case may be, for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years, or in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of his spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Unless the property is wholly or partially donated, the Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the owner's interest in the property on the date of its acquisition, less the fair market value on that date of the right retained by the owner. A right retained by the owner pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his determination that such right is being exercised in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this Act, and it shall terminate by operation of law upon notification by the Secretary to the holder of the right of such determination and tendering to him the amount equal to the fair market value of that portion which remains unexpired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Improved property&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;improved property&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a detached single family dwelling, the construction of which was begun before January 1, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;), together with the land on which the dwelling is situated to the extent that such land&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is in the same ownership as the dwelling or is Federal land on which entry was legal and proper, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is designated by the Secretary to be necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures necessary to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) property developed for noncommercial recreational uses, together with any structures accessory thereto which were so used on or before January 1, 1980, to the extent that entry onto such property was legal and proper.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining when and to what extent a property is to be considered an &ldquo;improved property&rdquo;, the Secretary shall take into consideration the manner of use of such buildings and lands prior to January 1, 1980, and shall designate such lands as are reasonably necessary for the continued enjoyment of the property in the same manner and to the same extent as existed before such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Consideration of hardship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by the owner of <!-- PDFPage:1981 -->any property within a conservation system unit to sell such property, if such owner notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership is causing, or would result in, undue hardship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Exchange authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in acquiring lands for the purposes of this Act, the Secretary is authorized to exchange lands (including lands within conservation system units and within the National Forest System) or interests therein (including Native selection rights) with the corporations organized by the Native Groups, Village Corporations, Regional Corporations, and the Urban Corporations, and other municipalities and corporations or individuals, the State (acting free of the restrictions of section 6(i) of the Alaska Statehood Act), or any Federal agency. Exchanges shall be on the basis of equal value, and either party to the exchange may pay or accept cash in order to equalize the value of the property exchanged, except that if the parties agree to an exchange and the Secretary determines it is in the public interest, such exchanges may be made for other than equal value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this Act or any other provision of law shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to convey, by exchange or otherwise, lands or interest in lands within the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (other than land validly selected prior to July 28, 1987), without prior approval by Act of Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Donation or exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to acquire by donation or exchange, lands (A) which are contiguous to any conservation system unit established or expanded by this Act, and (B) which are owned or validly selected by the State of Alaska.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Improved property on National Park System lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On public lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System created or enlarged by this Act, cabins or other structures existing prior to December 18, 1973, may be occupied and used by the claimant to these structures pursuant to a renewable, nontransferable permit. Such use and occupancy shall be for terms of five years each: <em>Provided</em>, That the claimant of the structure by application:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale or other documentation, proof of possessory interest or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Agrees to vacate the cabin and to remove all personal property from the cabin or structure upon expiration of the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Acknowledges in the permit that the applicant has no interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On public lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System created or enlarged by this Act, cabins or other structures, the occupancy or use of which commenced between December 18, 1973, and December 1, 1978, may be used and occupied by the claimant of such structure pursuant to a nontransferable, nonrenewable permit. Such use and occupancy shall be for a maximum term of one year: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the claimant, by application:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale, or other documentation, proof of possessory interest or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Agrees to vacate the cabin or structure and to remove all personal property from it upon expiration of the permit; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1982 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Acknowledges in the permit that the applicant has no legal interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may, on a case by case basis, subject to reasonable regulations, extend such permit term beyond one year for such reasons as the Secretary deems equitable and just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Cabins or other structure not under permit as specified herein shall be used only for official government business: <em>Provided however</em>, That during emergencies involving the safety of human life or where designated for public use by the Secretary, these cabins may be used by the general public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may issue a permit under such conditions as he may prescribe for the temporary use, occupancy, construction and maintenance of new cabins or other structures if he determines that the use is necessary to reasonably accommodate subsistence uses or is otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Improved property on other units or areas established or expanded by this Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following conditions shall apply regarding the construction, use and occupancy of cabins and related structures on Federal lands within conservation system units or areas not provided for in subsection (a) of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The construction of new cabins is prohibited except as may be authorized pursuant to a nontransferable, five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall only be issued upon a determination that the proposed use, construction, and maintenance of a cabin is compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established and that the use of the cabin is either directly related to the administration of the unit or area or is necessary to provide for a continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed within the unit or area where the permit applicant has no reasonable alternative site for constructing a cabin. No special use permit shall be issued to authorize the construction of a cabin for private recreational use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Traditional and customary uses of existing cabins and related structures on Federal lands within a unit or area may be allowed to continue in accordance with a nontransferable, renewable five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall be issued only upon a determination that the traditional and customary uses are compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established. No special use permits shall be issued to authorize the use of an existing cabin constructed for private recreational use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) No special use permit shall be issued under paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection unless the permit applicant:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the case of existing cabins or structures, reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale or other documentation, proof of possessory interests or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the existing or proposed cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Agrees to vacate the cabin or structure and to remove within a reasonable time period established by the Secretary, all personal property from it upon nonrenewal or revocation of the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Acknowledges in the permit application that the applicant has no interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located or will be constructed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States shall retain ownership of all new cabins and related structures on Federal lands within a unit or area specified in this subsection, and no proprietary rights or privileges shall be conveyed through the issuance of the special use permit authorized by paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection. Cabins or other structures not under permit shall be used only for official Government business: <em>Provided, however</em>, That during emergencies involving the safety of human life or where designated for public use by the unit or area manager, such cabins may be used by the general public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Permits to be renewed for life of claimant and immediate family</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever issuance of a nontransferable renewable five-year special use permit is authorized by subsections (a) or (b) of this section, said permit shall be renewed every five years until the death of the last immediate family member of the claimant residing in the cabin or structure, or unless the Secretary has revoked the special use permit in accordance with the criteria established in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary, after notice and hearing, may revoke a permit provided for in this section if he determines, on the basis of substantial evidence in the administrative record as a whole, that the use under the permit is causing or may cause significant detriment to the principal purposes for which the unit was established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Existing cabin leases or permits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this Act shall preclude the renewal or continuation of valid leases or permits in effect on December 2, 1980, for cabins, homesites, or similar structures on Federal lands. Unless the Secretary, or in the case of national forest lands, the Secretary of Agriculture, issues specific findings following notice and an opportunity for the lease-holder or permittee to respond, that renewal or continuation of such valid permit or lease constitutes a direct threat to or a significant impairment to the purposes for which a conservation system unit was established (in the case of a structure located within a conservation system unit) or the public domain or national forest (in case of a structure located outside conservation system units), he shall renew such valid leases or permits upon their expiration in accordance with the provisions of the original lease or permit, subject to such reasonable regulations as he may prescribe. Subject to the provisions of the original lease or permit, nothing in this Act or subsection shall necessarily preclude the appropriate Secretary from transferring such a lease or permit to another person at the election or death of the original permittee or leasee.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Application only to Alaska</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section are enacted in recognition of the unique conditions in Alaska. Nothing in this section shall be construed to expand, diminish, or modify the provisions of the Wilderness Act [16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.] or the application or interpretation of such provisions with respect to lands outside of Alaska.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Aquaculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In accordance with the goal of restoring and maintaining fish production in the State of Alaska to optimum sustained yield levels and in a manner which adequately assures protection, preservation, enhancement, and rehabilitation of the wilderness resource, the Secretary of Agriculture may permit fishery research, management, enhancement, and rehabilitation activities within national forest wilderness and national forest wilderness study areas designated by this Act. Subject to reasonable regulations, permanent improvements and facilities such as fishways, fish weirs, fish ladders, fish hatcheries, spawning channels, stream clearance, egg planting, and other accepted means of maintaining, enhancing, and rehabilitating fish stocks may be permitted by the Secretary to achieve this objective. Any fish hatchery, fishpass or other aquaculture facility authorized for any such area shall be constructed, managed, and operated in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on the wilderness character of the area. Developments for any such activities shall involve those facilities essential to these operations and shall be constructed in such rustic manner as to blend into the natural character of the area. Reasonable access solely for the purposes of this subsection, including temporary use of motorized equipment, shall be permitted in furtherance of research, management, rehabilitation and enhancement activities subject to reasonable regulations as the Secretary deems desirable to maintain the wilderness character, water quality, and fish and wildlife values of the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Existing cabins</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Previously existing public use cabins within wilderness designated by this Act, may be permitted to continue and may be maintained or replaced subject of such restrictions as the Secretary deems necessary to preserve the wilderness character of the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) New cabins</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within wilderness areas designated by this Act, the Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture as appropriate, is authorized to construct and maintain a limited number of new public use cabins and shelters if such cabins and shelters are necessary for the protection of the public health and safety. All such cabins or shelters shall be constructed of materials which blend and are compatible with the immediate and surrounding wilderness landscape. The Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture, as appropriate, shall notify the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of his intention to remove an existing or construct a new public use cabin or shelter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1988 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Timber contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture is hereby directed to modify any existing national forest timber sale contracts applying to lands designated by this Act as wilderness by substituting, to the extent practicable, timber on the other national forest lands approximately equal in volume, species, grade, and accessibility for timber or relevant lands within such units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Beach log salvage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With National Forest wilderness and national forest monuments desginated&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3203_1_target" name="3203_1">1</a></sup> by this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture may permit or otherwise regulate the recovery and salvage of logs from coastlines.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recommendation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time after December 2, 1980, the President may transmit a recommendation to the Congress that mineral exploration, development, or extraction not permitted under this Act or other applicable law shall be permitted in a specified area of the lands referred to in section 3231 of this title. Notice of such transmittal shall be published in the Federal Register. No recommendation of the President under this section may be transmitted to the Congress before ninety days after publication in the Federal Register of notice of his intention to submit such recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A recommendation may be transmitted to the Congress under subsection (a) of this section if the President finds that, based on the information available to him&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is an urgent national need for the mineral activity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such national need outweighs the other public values of the public lands involved and the potential adverse environmental impacts which are likely to result from the activity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Together with his recommendation, the President shall submit to the Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a report setting forth in detail the relevant factual background and the reasons for his findings and recommendation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a statement of the conditions and stipulations which would govern the activity if approved by the Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in any case in which an environmental impact statement is required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.], a statement which complies with the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)]. In the case of any recommendation for which an environmental impact statement is not required under section 102(2)(C) of the National environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)], the President may, if he deems it desirable, include such a statement in his transmittal to the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any recommendation under this section shall take effect only upon enactment of a joint resolution approving such recommendation within the first period of one hundred and twenty calendar days of continuous session of Congress beginning on the date after the date of receipt by the Senate and House of Representatives of such recommendation. Any recommendation of the President submitted to Congress under subsection (a) of this section shall be considered received by both Houses for purposes of this section on the first day on which both are in session occurring after such recommendation is submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) One-hundred-and-twenty-day computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) continuity of session of Congress is broken only by an adjournment sine die; and</p>
