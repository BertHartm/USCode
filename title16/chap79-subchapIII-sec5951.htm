<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) visitation will not unduly impair these resources and values; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) development of public accommodations, facilities, and services within such units can best be limited to locations that are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of such units.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the unit of the National Park System in which they are located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the unit.</p>
