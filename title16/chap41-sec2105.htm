<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the health of forests in urban areas and communities, including cities, their suburbs, and towns, in the United States is on the decline;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) forest lands, shade trees, and open spaces in urban areas and communities improve the quality of life for residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) forest lands and associated natural resources enhance the economic value of residential and commercial property in urban and community settings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) urban trees are 15 times more effective than forest trees at reducing the buildup of carbon dioxide and aid in promoting energy conservation through mitigation of the heat island effect in urban areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) tree plantings and ground covers such as low growing dense perennial turfgrass sod in urban areas and communities can aid in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, mitigating the heat island effect, and reducing energy consumption, thus contributing to efforts to reduce global warming trends;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) efforts to encourage tree plantings and protect existing open spaces in urban areas and communities can contribute to the social well-being and promote a sense of community in these areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) strengthened research, education, technical assistance, and public information and participation in tree planting and maintenance programs for trees and complementary ground covers for urban and community forests are needed to provide for the protection and expansion of tree cover and open space in urban areas and communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) improve understanding of the benefits of preserving existing tree cover in urban areas and communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) encourage owners of private residences and commercial properties to maintain trees and expand forest cover on their properties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide education programs and technical assistance to State and local organizations (including community associations and schools) in maintaining forested lands and individual trees in urban and community settings and identifying appropriate tree species and sites for expanding forest cover;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide assistance through competitive matching grants awarded to local units of government, approved organizations that meet the requirements of section 501(c)(3) of title 26, or other local community tree volunteer groups, for urban and community forestry projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) implement a tree planting program to complement urban and community tree maintenance and open space programs and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, conserve energy, and improve air quality in addition to providing other environmental benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) promote the establishment of demonstration projects in selected urban and community settings to illustrate the benefits of maintaining and creating forest cover and trees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) enhance the technical skills and understanding of sound tree maintenance and arboricultural practices including practices involving the cultivation of trees, shrubs and complementary ground covers, of individuals involved in the planning, development, and maintenance of urban and community forests and trees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) expand existing research and educational efforts intended to improve understanding of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of integrating trees and ground covers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the economic, environmental, social, and psychological benefits of trees and forest cover in urban and community environments, and</p>
