<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3301. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The stocks of salmon and steelhead which originate in the rivers of the conservation areas constitute valuable and renewable natural resources. Many groups of commercial, recreational, and treaty fishermen have historically depended upon these stocks of fish for their livelihoods and avocations. These fishery resources contribute to the food supply and economic health of the Pacific Northwest and the Nation as a whole, provide valuable recreational experiences for thousands of citizens from various parts of the United States and represent a central element of the cultures and economies of Indian tribes and the citizens of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Over a period of several decades, competing uses of salmon and steelhead habitat and historical problems relating to conservation <!-- PDFPage:2125 -->measures, the regulation of harvest and enhancement have depressed several of these stocks of salmon and steelhead.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Improved management and enhancement planning and coordination among salmon and steelhead managers will help prevent a further decline of salmon and steelhead stocks and will assist in increasing the supply of these stocks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Due in principal part to the Federal court decisions in the United States against Washington and Sohappy against Smith, the fishing capacity of nontreaty fishermen in the conservation areas established by this chapter exceeds that required to harvest the available salmon resources. This excess capacity causes severe economic problems for these fishermen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The supply of salmon and steelhead can be increased through carefully planned enhancement measures designed to improve the survival of stocks and to augment the production of artificially propagated stocks. By careful choice of species, areas, and stocking procedures, enhancement programs can be used to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) improve the distribution of fish among different groups of treaty and nontreaty fishermen; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) add stability to the treaty and nontreaty fisheries by reducing variations in fish availability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In order to assist the harvesters of the salmon and steelhead resources within the Columbia River conservation area and the Washington conservation area established by this chapter to overcome temporary dislocations arising from the decisions in the cases of United States against Washington and Sohappy against Smith and from other causes, this chapter authorizes the establishment of a cooperative program involving the United States, the States of Washington and Oregon, the treaty tribes acting through the appropriate tribal coordinating bodies, and other parties, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) encourage stability in and promote the economic well being of the treaty and nontreaty commercial fishing and charter fishing industries and improve the distribution of fishing power between treaty and nontreaty fisheries through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the purchase of nontreaty commercial and charter fishing vessels, gear, and licenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) coordinated research, enhancement, and management of salmon and steelhead resources and habitat; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve the quality of, and maintain the opportunities for, salmon and steelhead recreational fishing.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to in this subchapter as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;), in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, is authorized to establish a program to provide grants for projects for the enhancement of the salmon and steelhead resources of the Washington conservation area and the Columbia River conservation area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any such project in the Washington conservation area must be in accordance with a comprehensive enhancement plan developed and agreed to by the State of Washington and the Washington tribal coordinating body within 18 months after December 22, 1980. Any enhancement project in the Columbia River conservation area must be in accordance with a comprehensive enhancement plan developed and agreed to by the State of Washington, the State of Oregon, and the Columbia River tribal coordinating body within 18 months after December 22, 1980. Such plans must be approved by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, as provided in this subchapter. The States shall solicit and consider the comments and views of interested commercial and recreational fishermen, and other interested parties, in developing the comprehensive enhancement plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each comprehensive enhancement plan, and any revisions, or modifications of such plan, shall describe all enhancement projects in the conservation area, and associated stocking policies (when relevant), including any related research necessary to such enhancement anticipated by the States and the treaty tribes (acting through the appropriate tribal coordinating body) for a period of at least 5 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each comprehensive enhancement plan shall include such standards, restrictions, or conditions as are necessary, to assure that any project included in the plans contributes to the balanced and integrated development of the salmon and steelhead resources of the area. Such standards shall include, but not be limited to, provisions designed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assure that all commercial and recreational fishermen and the treaty tribes shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the benefits, considered as a whole, of the salmon and steelhead resources development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) minimize, to the extent practicable, significant adverse interaction between naturally spawning and artifically&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3321_1_target" name="3321_1">1</a></sup> propagated stocks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that all projects included within the plan are designed to complement the contribution of sound State, Federal, and tribal enhancement activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that all projects included within the plan are economically and biologically sound and supported by adequate scientific research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) assure that all projects included within the plan achieve significant benefits relative to the overall cost of each such project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) consider the effect of enhancement activities as they relate to existing and future international commitments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) notwithstanding any of the above measures, provide for the harvest of fish by treaty tribes in accordance with treaty rights, unless agreed otherwise by the affected treaty tribes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall review each comprehensive enhancement plan and approve such plan within 120 days of the date of its receipt, if <!-- PDFPage:2129 -->found to be consistent with this chapter and other applicable law. If the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, finds that a plan is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter or other applicable law, he shall return such plan to the State of Washington or the State of Oregon, or both, as appropriate, and the appropriate tribal coordinating body with recommendations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon receiving such a plan, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) publish a notice in the Federal Register of the availability of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide a copy of the plan to the Pacific Fishery Management Council and, upon request, to any other interested person or group, and solicit and consider the comments and views of such persons or groups with respect to the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) undertake a biological and technical review of the plan, in consultation with individuals who are knowledgeable with regard to the management, conservation, enhancement, and harvest of the salmon and steelhead resources of the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provide a copy of the plan to and consult with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, with respect to the effect of such plan on any international fisheries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) determine whether the State of Washington or the State of Oregon, as appropriate, and the treaty tribes, acting through their chosen agency or agencies, have the authority to carry out the plan in accordance with this chapter, and in accordance with standards included within the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall not approve a comprehensive enhancement plan unless the State of Washington or the State of Oregon, or both, as appropriate, and the treaty tribes, acting through the appropriate tribal coordinating body, agree not to undertake any salmon or steelhead enhancement project, using funds provided pursuant to this subchapter or otherwise, that would be inconsistent with the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not approve a comprehensive plan unless the Secretary of Commerce concurs that such plan satisfactorily complies with standards (1), (6), and (7) of subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Review, modification, or revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each comprehensive enhancement plan shall be reviewed periodically. The Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce, the State of Washington, the State of Oregon, or the appropriate tribal coordinating body may request a review, modification, or revision of a plan at any time. Any revision or modification of a plan, developed and agreed to by the State of Washington or the State of Oregon, as appropriate, and the appropriate tribal coordinating body, shall be approved by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, within 45 days of receipt of the proposed revision or modification, if such revision or modification is in conformity with this chapter and other applicable law.
