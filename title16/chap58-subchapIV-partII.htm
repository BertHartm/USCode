<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Submission of contract offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to participate in the conservation stewardship program, a producer shall submit to the Secretary for approval a contract offer that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the producer, at the time of the contract offer, is meeting the stewardship threshold for at least one resource concern; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2220 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) would, at a minimum, meet or exceed the stewardship threshold for at least 1 priority resource concern by the end of the stewardship contract by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) installing and adopting additional conservation activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) improving, maintaining, and managing conservation activities in place at the operation of the producer at the time the contract offer is accepted by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Ranking of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating contract offers made by producers to enter into contracts under the program, the Secretary shall rank applications based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the level of conservation treatment on all applicable priority resource concerns at the time of application, based to the maximum extent practicable on conservation measurement tools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the degree to which the proposed conservation treatment on applicable priority resource concerns effectively increases conservation performance, based to the maximum extent possible on conservation measurement tools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the number of applicable priority resource concerns proposed to be treated to meet or exceed the stewardship threshold by the end of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the extent to which other resource concerns, in addition to priority resource concerns, will be addressed to meet or exceed the stewardship threshold by the end of the contract period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the extent to which the actual and anticipated environmental benefits from the contract are provided at the least cost relative to other similarly beneficial contract offers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition</h4>
