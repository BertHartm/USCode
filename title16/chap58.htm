<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall permit a person who makes a certification under paragraph (1) with respect to a conservation plan to revise the conservation plan in any manner, if the same level of conservation treatment provided for by the conservation system under the person's conservation plan is maintained. The Secretary may not revise the person's conservation plan without the concurrence of the person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Technical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, using available resources and consistent with the Secretary's other conservation responsibilities and objectives, provide technical assistance to a person throughout the development, revision, and application of the conservation plan and any conservation system of the person.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Wetland delineation maps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall delineate wetlands on wetland delineation maps. On the request of a person, the Secretary shall make a reasonable effort to make an on-site wetland determination prior to delineation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On providing notice to affected persons, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certify whether a map is sufficient for the purpose of making a determination of ineligibility for program benefits under section 3821 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide an opportunity to appeal the certification prior to the certification becoming final.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Duration of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A final certification made under paragraph (3) shall remain valid and in effect as long as the area is devoted to an agricultural use or until such time as the person affected by the certification requests review of the certification by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of mapping on appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an appeal of the Secretary's certification, the Secretary shall review and certify the accuracy of the mapping of all land subject to the appeal to ensure that the subject land has been accurately delineated.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Reliance on prior certified delineation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person shall be adversely affected because of having taken an action based on a previous certified wetland delineation by the Secretary. The delineation shall not be subject to a subsequent wetland certification or delineation by the Secretary, unless requested by the person under paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No person shall become ineligible under section 3821 of this title for program loans or payments under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) As the result of the production of an agricultural commodity on the following lands:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A converted wetland if the conversion of the wetland was commenced before December 23, 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Land that is a nontidal drainage or irrigation ditch excavated in upland.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A wet area created by a water delivery system, irrigation, irrigation system, or application of water for irrigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A wetland on which the owner or operator of a farm or ranch uses normal cropping or ranching practices to produce an agricultural commodity in a manner that is consistent for the area where the production is possible as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and is without action by the producer that destroys a natural wetland characteristic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Land that is an artificial lake or pond created by excavating or diking land (that is not a wetland) to collect and retain water and that is used primarily for livestock watering, fish production, irrigation, wildlife, fire control, flood control, cranberry growing, or rice production, or as a settling pond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) A wetland that is temporarily or incidentally created as a result of adjacent development activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) A converted wetland if the original conversion of the wetland was commenced before December 23, 1985, and the Secretary determines the wetland characteristics returned after that date as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the lack of maintenance of drainage, dikes, levees, or similar structures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a lack of management of the lands containing the wetland; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) circumstances beyond the control of the person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proposed conversion action is approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service prior to implementation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the extent of the proposed conversion is limited so that the conditions will be at least equivalent to the wetland functions and values that existed prior to implementation of the voluntary wetland restoration, enhancement, or creation action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For the conversion of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) An artificial lake or pond created by excavating or diking land that is not a wetland to collect and retain water and that is used primarily for livestock watering, fish production, irrigation, wildlife, fire control, flood control, cranberry growing, rice production, or as a settling pond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A wetland that is temporarily or incidentally created as a result of adjacent development activity.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2184 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A wetland on which the owner or operator of a farm or ranch uses normal cropping or ranching practices to produce an agricultural commodity in a manner that is consistent for the area where the production is possible as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and is without action by the producer that destroys a natural wetland characteristic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A wetland previously identified as a converted wetland (if the original conversion of the wetland was commenced before December 23, 1985), but that the Secretary determines returned to wetland status after that date as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the lack of maintenance of drainage, dikes, levees, or similar structures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a lack of management of the lands containing the wetland; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) circumstances beyond the control of the person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A wetland, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the wetland was determined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to have been manipulated for the production of an agricultural commodity or forage prior to December 23, 1985, and was returned to wetland conditions through a voluntary restoration, enhancement, or creation action subsequent to that determination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical determinations regarding the prior site conditions and the restoration, enhancement, or creation action have been adequately documented by the Natural Resources Conservation Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proposed conversion action is approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service prior to implementation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the extent of the proposed conversion is limited so that the conditions will be at least equivalent to the wetland functions and values that existed prior to implementation of the voluntary wetland restoration, enhancement, or creation action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) On-site inspection requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No program loans, payments, or benefits shall be withheld from a person under this subchapter unless the Secretary has conducted an on-site visit of the subject land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Identification of minimal effect exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of applying the minimal effect exemption under subsection (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall identify by regulation categorical minimal effect exemptions on a regional basis to assist persons in avoiding a violation of the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title. The Secretary shall ensure that employees of the Department of Agriculture who administer this subchapter receive appropriate training to properly apply the minimal effect exemptions determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonwetlands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exempt from the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title any action by a person upon lands in any case in which the Secretary determines that any one of the following does not apply with respect to such lands:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such lands have a predominance of hydric soils.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such lands are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Such lands, under normal circumstances, support a prevalence of such vegetation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Minimal effect; mitigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exempt a person from the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title for any action associated with the production of an agricultural commodity on a converted wetland, or the conversion of a wetland, if 1 or more of the following conditions apply, as determined by the Secretary:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The action, individually and in connection with all other similar actions authorized by the Secretary in the area, will have a minimal effect on the functional hydrological and biological value of the wetlands in the area, including the value to waterfowl and wildlife.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The wetland and the wetland values, acreage, and functions are mitigated by the person through the restoration of a converted wetland, the enhancement of an existing wetland, or the creation of a new wetland, and the restoration, enhancement, or creation is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in accordance with a wetland conservation plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) prohibits making alterations to the restored, enhanced, or created wetland that lower the wetland's functions and values.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The wetland was converted after December 23, 1985, but before November 28, 1990, and the wetland values, acreage, and functions are <!-- PDFPage:2185 -->mitigated by the producer through the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (F), and (G) of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The action was authorized by a permit issued under section 1344 of title 33 and the wetland values, acreage, and functions of the converted wetland were adequately mitigated for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall permit an owner or operator that has entered into a contract under this subpart that is in effect on November 28, 1990, to convert areas of highly erodible cropland that are subject to the contract, and that are devoted to vegetative cover, from that use to hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife corridors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Terms</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Extension of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a contract that is modified under this section that provides for the planting of hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife corridors, if the original term of the contract was less than 15 years, the owner or operator may extend the contract to a term of not to exceed 15 years.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2200 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cost share assistance</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conversion to wetland</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall permit an owner or operator that has entered into a contract under this subpart that is in effect on November 28, 1990, to restore areas of highly erodible cropland that are devoted to vegetative cover under the contract to wetland if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the areas are prior converted wetland;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the owner or operator of the areas enters into an agreement to provide the Secretary with a long-term or permanent easement under subpart C covering the areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a high probability that the prior converted area can be successfully restored to wetland status; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the restoration of the areas otherwise meets the requirements of subpart C.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not incur, through a conversion under this section, any additional expense on the acres, including the expense involved in the original establishment of the vegetative cover, that would result in cost share for costs under this section in excess of the costs that would have been subject to cost share for the new practice had that practice been the original practice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a wetlands reserve program to assist owners of eligible lands in restoring and protecting wetlands.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purposes of the wetlands reserve program are to restore, protect, or enhance wetlands on private or tribal lands that are eligible under subsections (c) and (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enrollment conditions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maximum enrollment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total number of acres enrolled in the wetlands reserve program shall not exceed 3,041,200 acres.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Methods of enrollment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (3), the Secretary shall enroll acreage into the wetlands reserve program through the use of permanent easements, 30-year easements, restoration cost share agreements, or any combination of those options.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Acreage owned by Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of acreage owned by an Indian tribe, the Secretary shall enroll acreage into the wetlands reserve program through the use of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a 30-year contract (the value of which shall be equivalent to the value of a 30-year easement);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) restoration cost-share agreements; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any combination of the options described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enrolling land in the wetland reserve established under this subpart during the 1991 through 2012 fiscal years, private or tribal land shall be eligible to be placed into such reserve if the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior at the local level, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such land is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with the adjacent land that is functionally dependent on the wetlands, except that converted wetland with respect to which the conversion was not commenced prior to December 23, 1985, shall not be eligible to be enrolled in the program under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) cropland or grassland that was used for agricultural production prior to flooding from the natural overflow of a closed basin lake or pothole, as determined by the Secretary, together (where practicable) with the adjacent land that is functionally dependent on the cropland or grassland; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the program taking into consideration the cost of such restoration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other eligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the wetland reserve established under this subpart, together with land that is eligible under subsection (c) of this section, land that maximizes wildlife benefits and that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) farmed wetland and adjoining lands, enrolled in the conservation reserve, with the <!-- PDFPage:2201 -->highest wetland functions and values, and that are likely to return to production after they leave the conservation reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) other wetland of an owner that would not otherwise be eligible if the Secretary determines that the inclusion of such wetland in such easement would significantly add to the functional value of the easement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) riparian areas that link wetlands that are protected by easements or some other device or circumstance that achieves the same purpose as an easement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Ineligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not acquire easements on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) land that contains timber stands established under the conservation reserve under subpart B; or</p>
