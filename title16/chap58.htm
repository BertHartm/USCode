<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determines that such failure results in a violation of section 3811 of this title that is technical and minor in nature and that such violation has a minimal effect on the erosion control purposes of the conservation plan applicable to the land on which such violation has occurred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determines that such failure is due to circumstances beyond the control of the person; or</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Terms of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the terms of a contract entered into under this subpart, during the term of such contract, an owner or operator of a farm or ranch must agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to implement a plan approved by the local conservation district (or in an area not located within a conservation district, a plan approved by the Secretary) for converting eligible lands normally devoted to the production of an agricultural commodity on the farm or ranch to a less intensive use (as defined by the Secretary), such as pasture, permanent grass, legumes, forbs, shrubs, or trees, substantially in accordance with a schedule outlined in the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to place highly erodible cropland subject to the contract in the conservation reserve established under this subpart;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) not to use such land for agricultural purposes, except as permitted by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to establish approved vegetative cover, or water cover for the enhancement of wildlife, on such land, except that such water cover shall not include ponds for the purpose of watering livestock, irrigating crops, or raising fish for commercial purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in addition to the remedies provided under section 3836(d) of this title, on the violation of a term or condition of the contract at any time the owner or operator has control of such land&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to forfeit all rights to receive rental payments and cost sharing payments under the contract and to refund to the Secretary any rental payments and cost sharing payments received by the owner or operator under the contract, together with interest thereon as determined by the Secretary, if the Secretary, after considering the recommendations of the soil conservation district and the Soil Conservation Service, determines that such violation is of such nature as to warrant termination of the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refund to the Secretary, or accept adjustments to, the rental payments and cost sharing payments provided to the owner or operator, as the Secretary considers appropriate, if the Secretary determines that such violation does not warrant termination of the contract;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) on the transfer of the right and interest of the owner or operator in land subject to the contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to forfeit all rights to rental payments and cost sharing payments under the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refund to the United States all rental payments and cost sharing payments received by the owner or operator, or accept such payment adjustments or make such refunds as the Secretary considers appropriate and consistent with the objectives of this subpart;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">unless the transferee of such land agrees with the Secretary to assume all obligations of the contract, or the transferee and the Secretary agree to modifications to such contract, where such modifications are consistent with the objectives of the program as determined by the Secretary; <em>Provided however</em>, no refund of rental payments and cost sharing payments shall be required when the land is purchased by or for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) not to conduct any harvesting or grazing, nor otherwise make commercial use of the forage, on land that is subject to the contract, nor adopt any similar practice specified in the contract by the Secretary as a practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract, except that the Secretary may permit harvesting or grazing or other commercial use of the forage on land that is subject to the contract in response to a drought or other similar emergency, and the Secretary may permit limited grazing on such land where such grazing is incidental to the gleaning of crop residues on the fields in which such land is located and occurs during the 7-month period in which grazing of conserving use acreage is allowed in a State under the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) or after the producer harvests the grain crop of the surrounding field for a reduction in rental payment commensurate with the limited economic value of such incidental grazing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) not to conduct any planting of trees on land that is subject to the contract unless the contract specifies that the harvesting and commercial sale of trees such as Christmas trees are prohibited, nor otherwise make commercial use of trees on land that is subject to the contract unless it is expressly permitted <!-- PDFPage:1800 -->in the contract, nor adopt any similar practice specified in the contract by the Secretary as a practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract, except that no contract shall prohibit activities consistent with customary forestry practice, such as pruning, thinning, or stand improvement of trees, on lands converted to forestry use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) not to adopt any practice specified by the Secretary in the contract as a practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of this subpart; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) to comply with such additional provisions as the Secretary determines are desirable and are included in the contract to carry out this subpart or to facilitate the practical administration thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) with respect to any contract entered into after November 28, 1990, concerning highly erodible land in a county that has not reached the limitation established by section 3843(f) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to produce an agricultural commodity for the duration of the contract on any other highly erodible land that such owner or operator has purchased after November 28, 1990, and that does not have a history of being used to produce an agricultural commodity other than forage crops; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the violation of a contract described in subparagraph (A), to be subject to the sanctions described in paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conversion plan provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall set forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the conservation measures and practices to be carried out by the owner or operator during the term of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the commercial use, if any, to be permitted on the land during such term; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may provide for the permanent retirement of any existing cropland base and allotment history for the land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Environmental use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent practicable, not less than one-eighth of land that is placed in the conservation reserve under this subpart during the 1991 through 1995 calendar years shall be devoted to trees, or devoted to shrubs or other noncrop vegetation or water that may provide a permanent habitat for wildlife including migratory waterfowl.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alley cropping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may permit alley cropping of agricultural commodities on land that is subject to contracts entered into under this subpart, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such land is planted to hardwood trees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such agricultural commodities will be produced in conjunction with, and in close proximity to, such hardwood trees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the owner or operator of such land agrees to implement appropriate conservation practices concerning such land.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall develop a bid system by which owners and operators may offer to reduce their annual rental payments in exchange for permission to produce agricultural commodities on such land in accordance with this subsection. The Secretary shall not accept offers under this paragraph that provide for less than a 50 percent reduction in such annual payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall ensure that the total annual rental payments over the term of any contract modified under this subsection are not in excess of that specified in the original contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;alley cropping&rdquo; means the practice of planting rows of trees bordered on each side by a narrow strip of groundcover, alternated with wider strips of row crops or grain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner or operator who is a party to a contract entered into under this subpart may not be required to make repayments to the Secretary of amounts received under such contract if the land that is subject to such contract has been foreclosed upon and the Secretary determines that forgiving such repayments is appropriate in order to provide fair and equitable treatment. This subsection shall not void the responsibilities of such an owner or operator under the contract if such owner or operator resumes control over the property that is subject to the contract within the period specified in the contract. Upon the resumption of such control over the property by the owner or operator, the provisions of the contract in effect on the date of the foreclosure shall apply.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conversion to trees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall permit an owner or operator who has entered into a contract under this subpart that is in effect on November 28, 1990, to convert areas of highly erodible cropland that are subject to such contract, and that are devoted to vegetative cover, from such use to hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife corridors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Terms</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Extension of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a contract that is modified under this section that provides for the planting of hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife corridors, if the original term of the contract was less than 15 years, the owner or operator may extend the contract to a term of not to exceed 15 years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cost share assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall pay 50 percent of the cost of establishing conservation measures and practices authorized under this subsection for which the Secretary determines the cost sharing is appropriate and in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conversion to wetlands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall permit an owner or operator who has entered into a contract under this subpart that is in effect on November 28, 1990, to restore areas of highly erodible cropland that are devoted to vegetative cover under such contract to wetlands if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such areas are prior converted wetlands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the owner or operator of such areas enters into an agreement to provide the Secretary with a long-term or permanent easement under subpart C covering such areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a high probability that the prior converted area can be successfully restored to wetland status; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the restoration of such areas otherwise meets the requirements of subpart C.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not incur, through a conversion under this section, any additional expense on such acres, including the expense involved in the original establishment of the vegetative cover, that would result in cost share for costs in excess of the costs that would have been subject to cost share for the new practice had that practice been the original practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Condition of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An owner or operator shall as a condition of entering into a contract under subsection (a) of this section participate in the Forest Stewardship Program established under section 2103a of this title.</p>
