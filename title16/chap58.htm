<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Wetland delineation maps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall delineate wetlands on wetland delineation maps. On the request of a person, the Secretary shall make a reasonable effort to make an on-site wetland determination prior to delineation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On providing notice to affected persons, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certify whether a map is sufficient for the purpose of making a determination of ineligibility for program benefits under section 3821 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide an opportunity to appeal the certification prior to the certification becoming final.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1858 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Duration of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A final certification made under paragraph (3) shall remain valid and in effect as long as the area is devoted to an agricultural use or until such time as the person affected by the certification requests review of the certification by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of mapping on appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an appeal of the Secretary's certification, the Secretary shall review and certify the accuracy of the mapping of all land subject to the appeal to ensure that the subject land has been accurately delineated.

The delineation shall not be subject to a subsequent wetland certification or delineation by the Secretary, unless requested by the person under paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No person shall become ineligible under section 3821 of this title for program loans or payments under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) As the result of the production of an agricultural commodity on the following lands:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A wetland on which the owner or operator of a farm or ranch uses normal cropping or ranching practices to produce an agricultural commodity in a manner that is consistent for the area where the production is possible as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and is without action by the producer that destroys a natural wetland characteristic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Land that is an artificial lake or pond created by excavating or diking land (that is not a wetland) to collect and retain water and that is used primarily for livestock watering, fish production, irrigation, wildlife, fire control, flood control, cranberry growing, or rice production, or as a settling pond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) A wetland that is temporarily or incidentally created as a result of adjacent development activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) A converted wetland if the original conversion of the wetland was commenced before December 23, 1985, and the Secretary determines the wetland characteristics returned after that date as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the lack of maintenance of drainage, dikes, levees, or similar structures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a lack of management of the lands containing the wetland; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A wetland on which the owner or operator of a farm or ranch uses normal cropping or ranching practices to produce an agricultural commodity in a manner that is consistent for the area where the production is possible as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and is without action by the producer that destroys a natural wetland characteristic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A wetland previously identified as a converted wetland (if the original conversion of the wetland was commenced before December 23, 1985), but that the Secretary determines returned to wetland status after that date as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the lack of maintenance of drainage, dikes, levees, or similar structures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a lack of management of the lands containing the wetland; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) circumstances beyond the control of the person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A wetland, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the wetland was determined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to have been manipulated for the production of an agricultural commodity or forage prior to December 23, 1985, and was returned to wetland conditions through a voluntary restoration, enhancement, or creation action subsequent to that determination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical determinations regarding the prior site conditions and the restoration, enhancement, or creation action <!-- PDFPage:1859 -->have been adequately documented by the Natural Resources Conservation Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proposed conversion action is approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service prior to implementation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the extent of the proposed conversion is limited so that the conditions will be at least equivalent to the wetland functions and values that existed prior to implementation of the voluntary wetland restoration, enhancement, or creation action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) On-site inspection requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No program loans, payments, or benefits shall be withheld from a person under this subchapter unless the Secretary has conducted an on-site visit of the subject land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Identification of minimal effect exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of applying the minimal effect exemption under subsection (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall identify by regulation categorical minimal effect exemptions on a regional basis to assist persons in avoiding a violation of the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title. The Secretary shall ensure that employees of the Department of Agriculture who administer this subchapter receive appropriate training to properly apply the minimal effect exemptions determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonwetlands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exempt from the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title any action by a person upon lands in any case in which the Secretary determines that any one of the following does not apply with respect to such lands:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such lands have a predominance of hydric soils.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such lands are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Such lands, under normal circumstances, support a prevalence of such vegetation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Minimal effect; mitigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exempt a person from the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title for any action associated with the production of an agricultural commodity on a converted wetland, or the conversion of a wetland, if 1 or more of the following conditions apply, as determined by the Secretary:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The action, individually and in connection with all other similar actions authorized by the Secretary in the area, will have a minimal effect on the functional hydrological and biological value of the wetlands in the area, including the value to waterfowl and wildlife.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The wetland and the wetland values, acreage, and functions are mitigated by the person through the restoration of a converted wetland, the enhancement of an existing wetland, or the creation of a new wetland, and the restoration, enhancement, or creation is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in accordance with a wetland conservation plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in advance of, or concurrent with, the action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not at the expense of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of enhancement or restoration of wetlands, on not greater than a 1-for-1 acreage basis unless more acreage is needed to provide equivalent functions and values that will be lost as a result of the wetland conversion to be mitigated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in the case of creation of wetlands, on greater than a 1-for-1 acreage basis if more acreage is needed to provide equivalent functions and values that will be lost as a result of the wetland conversion that is mitigated;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) prohibits making alterations to the restored, enhanced, or created wetland that lower the wetland's functions and values.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The wetland was converted after December 23, 1985, but before November 28, 1990, and the wetland values, acreage, and functions are mitigated by the producer through the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (F), and (G) of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The action was authorized by a permit issued under section 1344 of title 33 and the wetland values, acreage, and functions of the converted wetland were adequately mitigated for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mitigation appeals</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to implement a plan approved by the local conservation district (or in an area not located within a conservation district, a plan approved by the Secretary) for converting eligible lands normally devoted to the production of an agricultural commodity on the farm or ranch to a less intensive use (as defined by the Secretary), such as pasture, permanent grass, legumes, forbs, shrubs, or trees, substantially in accordance with a schedule outlined in the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to place highly erodible cropland subject to the contract in the conservation reserve established under this subpart;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) not to use such land for agricultural purposes, except as permitted by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to establish approved vegetative cover, or water cover for the enhancement of wildlife, on such land, except that such water cover <!-- PDFPage:1864 -->shall not include ponds for the purpose of watering livestock, irrigating crops, or raising fish for commercial purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in addition to the remedies provided under section 3836(d) of this title, on the violation of a term or condition of the contract at any time the owner or operator has control of such land&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to forfeit all rights to receive rental payments and cost sharing payments under the contract and to refund to the Secretary any rental payments and cost sharing payments received by the owner or operator under the contract, together with interest thereon as determined by the Secretary, if the Secretary, after considering the recommendations of the soil conservation district and the Soil Conservation Service, determines that such violation is of such nature as to warrant termination of the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refund to the Secretary, or accept adjustments to, the rental payments and cost sharing payments provided to the owner or operator, as the Secretary considers appropriate, if the Secretary determines that such violation does not warrant termination of the contract;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) on the transfer of the right and interest of the owner or operator in land subject to the contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to forfeit all rights to rental payments and cost sharing payments under the contract; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">unless the transferee of such land agrees with the Secretary to assume all obligations of the contract, or the transferee and the Secretary agree to modifications to such contract, where such modifications are consistent with the objectives of the program as determined by the Secretary; <em>Provided however</em>, no refund of rental payments and cost sharing payments shall be required when the land is purchased by or for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) not to conduct any harvesting or grazing, nor otherwise make commercial use of the forage, on land that is subject to the contract, nor adopt any similar practice specified in the contract by the Secretary as a practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract, except that the Secretary may permit harvesting or grazing or other commercial use of the forage on land that is subject to the contract in response to a drought or other similar emergency, and the Secretary may permit limited grazing on such land where such grazing is incidental to the gleaning of crop residues on the fields in which such land is located and occurs during the 7-month period in which grazing of conserving use acreage is allowed in a State under the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) or after the producer harvests the grain crop of the surrounding field for a reduction in rental payment commensurate with the limited economic value of such incidental grazing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) not to conduct any planting of trees on land that is subject to the contract unless the contract specifies that the harvesting and commercial sale of trees such as Christmas trees are prohibited, nor otherwise make commercial use of trees on land that is subject to the contract unless it is expressly permitted in the contract, nor adopt any similar practice specified in the contract by the Secretary as a practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract, except that no contract shall prohibit activities consistent with customary forestry practice, such as pruning, thinning, or stand improvement of trees, on lands converted to forestry use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) not to adopt any practice specified by the Secretary in the contract as a practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of this subpart; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) to comply with such additional provisions as the Secretary determines are desirable and are included in the contract to carry out this subpart or to facilitate the practical administration thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) with respect to any contract entered into after November 28, 1990, concerning highly erodible land in a county that has not reached the limitation established by section 3843(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3832_1_target" name="3832_1">1</a></sup> of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to produce an agricultural commodity for the duration of the contract on any other highly erodible land that such owner or operator has purchased after November 28, 1990, and that does not have a history of being used to produce an agricultural commodity other than forage crops; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the violation of a contract described in subparagraph (A), to be subject to the sanctions described in paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conversion plan provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall set forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the conservation measures and practices to be carried out by the owner or operator during the term of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the commercial use, if any, to be permitted on the land during such term; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may provide for the permanent retirement of any existing cropland base and allotment history for the land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Environmental use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent practicable, not less than one-eighth of land that is placed in the conservation reserve under this subpart during the 1991 through 2002 calendar years shall be devoted to trees, or devoted to shrubs or other noncrop vegetation or water that may provide a permanent habitat for wildlife including migratory waterfowl.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alley cropping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may permit alley cropping of agricultural commodities on land that is sub<!-- PDFPage:1865 -->ject to contracts entered into under this subpart, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such land is planted to hardwood trees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such agricultural commodities will be produced in conjunction with, and in close proximity to, such hardwood trees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the owner or operator of such land agrees to implement appropriate conservation practices concerning such land.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall develop a bid system by which owners and operators may offer to reduce their annual rental payments in exchange for permission to produce agricultural commodities on such land in accordance with this subsection. The Secretary shall not accept offers under this paragraph that provide for less than a 50 percent reduction in such annual payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall ensure that the total annual rental payments over the term of any contract modified under this subsection are not in excess of that specified in the original contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;alley cropping&rdquo; means the practice of planting rows of trees bordered on each side by a narrow strip of groundcover, alternated with wider strips of row crops or grain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner or operator who is a party to a contract entered into under this subpart may not be required to make repayments to the Secretary of amounts received under such contract if the land that is subject to such contract has been foreclosed upon and the Secretary determines that forgiving such repayments is appropriate in order to provide fair and equitable treatment. This subsection shall not void the responsibilities of such an owner or operator under the contract if such owner or operator resumes control over the property that is subject to the contract within the period specified in the contract. Upon the resumption of such control over the property by the owner or operator, the provisions of the contract in effect on the date of the foreclosure shall apply.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enrolling land in the wetland reserve established under this subpart during the 1991 through 2002 calendar years, land shall be eligible to be placed into such reserve if the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior at the local level, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such land is farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with adjacent lands that are functionally dependent on such wetlands, except that converted wetlands where the conversion was not commenced prior to December 23, 1985, shall not be eligible to be enrolled in the program under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the program taking into consideration the cost of such restoration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other eligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the wetland reserve established under this subpart, together with land that is eligible under subsection (c) of this section, land that maximizes wildlife benefits and that is&mdash;</p>
