<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Delineation by Secretary</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsection (b) of this section and paragraph (6), the Secretary shall delineate, determine, and certify all wetlands located on subject land on a farm.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Wetland delineation maps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall delineate wetlands on wetland delineation maps. On the request of a person, the Secretary shall make a reasonable effort to make an on-site wetland determination prior to delineation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On providing notice to affected persons, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certify whether a map is sufficient for the purpose of making a determination of ineligibility for program benefits under section 3821 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide an opportunity to appeal the certification prior to the certification becoming final.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Duration of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A final certification made under paragraph (3) shall remain valid and in effect as long as the area is devoted to an agricultural use or until such time as the person affected by the certification requests review of the certification by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of mapping on appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an appeal of the Secretary's certification, the Secretary shall review and certify the accuracy of the mapping of all land subject to the appeal to ensure that the subject land has been accurately delineated. Prior to rendering a decision on the appeal, the Secretary shall conduct an on-site inspection of the subject land on a farm.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Reliance on prior certified delineation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person shall be adversely affected because of having taken an action based on a previous certified wetland delineation by the Secretary.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A wetland on which the owner or operator of a farm or ranch uses normal cropping or ranching practices to produce an agricultural commodity in a manner that is consistent for the area where the production is possible as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and is without action by the producer that destroys a natural wetland characteristic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Land that is an artificial lake or pond created by excavating or diking land (that is not a wetland) to collect and retain water and that is used primarily for livestock watering, fish production, irrigation, wildlife, fire control, flood control, cranberry growing, or rice production, or as a settling pond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) A wetland that is temporarily or incidentally created as a result of adjacent development activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) A converted wetland if the original conversion of the wetland was commenced before December 23, 1985, and the Secretary determines the wetland characteristics returned after that date as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the lack of maintenance of drainage, dikes, levees, or similar structures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a lack of management of the lands containing the wetland; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A wetland on which the owner or operator of a farm or ranch uses normal cropping or ranching practices to produce an agricultural commodity in a manner that is consistent for the area where the production is possible as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and is without action by the producer that destroys a natural wetland characteristic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A wetland previously identified as a converted wetland (if the original conversion of the wetland was commenced before December 23, 1985), but that the Secretary determines returned to wetland status after that date as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the lack of maintenance of drainage, dikes, levees, or similar structures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a lack of management of the lands containing the wetland; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) circumstances beyond the control of the person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A wetland, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the wetland was determined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to have been manipulated for the production of an agricultural commodity or forage prior to December 23, 1985, and was returned to wetland conditions through a voluntary restoration, enhancement, or creation action subsequent to that determination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical determinations regarding the prior site conditions and the restoration, enhancement, or creation action have been adequately documented by the Natural Resources Conservation Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proposed conversion action is approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service prior to implementation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the extent of the proposed conversion is limited so that the conditions will be at least equivalent to the wetland functions and values that existed prior to implementation of the voluntary wetland restoration, enhancement, or creation action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) On-site inspection requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No program loans, payments, or benefits shall be withheld from a person under this subchapter unless the Secretary has conducted an on-site visit of the subject land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Identification of minimal effect exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of applying the minimal effect exemption under subsection (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall identify by regulation categorical minimal effect exemptions on a regional basis to assist persons in avoiding a violation of the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title. The Secretary shall ensure that employees of the Department of Agriculture who administer this subchapter receive appropriate training to properly apply the minimal effect exemptions determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonwetlands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exempt from the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title any action by a person upon lands in any case in which the Secretary determines that any one of the following does not apply with respect to such lands:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such lands have a predominance of hydric soils.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such lands are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Such lands, under normal circumstances, support a prevalence of such vegetation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Minimal effect; mitigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exempt a person from the ineligibility provisions of section 3821 of this title for any action associated with the production of an agricultural commodity on a converted wetland, or the conversion of a wetland, if 1 or more of the following conditions apply, as determined by the Secretary:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The action, individually and in connection with all other similar actions authorized by the Secretary in the area, will have a minimal effect on the functional hydrological and biological value of the wetlands in the area, including the value to waterfowl and wildlife.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The wetland and the wetland values, acreage, and functions are mitigated by the person through the restoration of a converted wetland, the enhancement of an existing wetland, or the creation of a new wetland, and the restoration, enhancement, or creation is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in accordance with a wetland conservation plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in advance of, or concurrent with, the action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not at the expense of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of enhancement or restoration of wetlands, on not greater than a 1-for-1 acreage basis unless more acreage is need<!-- PDFPage:2110 -->ed to provide equivalent functions and values that will be lost as a result of the wetland conversion to be mitigated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in the case of creation of wetlands, on greater than a 1-for-1 acreage basis if more acreage is needed to provide equivalent functions and values that will be lost as a result of the wetland conversion that is mitigated;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) prohibits making alterations to the restored, enhanced, or created wetland that lower the wetland's functions and values.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The wetland was converted after December 23, 1985, but before November 28, 1990, and the wetland values, acreage, and functions are mitigated by the producer through the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (F), and (G) of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The action was authorized by a permit issued under section 1344 of title 33 and the wetland values, acreage, and functions of the converted wetland were adequately mitigated for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a wetlands reserve program to assist owners of eligible lands in restoring and protecting wetlands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enrollment conditions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maximum enrollment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total number of acres enrolled in the wetlands reserve program shall not exceed 2,275,000 acres, of which, to the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall enroll 250,000 acres in each calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Methods of enrollment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall enroll acreage into the wetlands reserve program through the use of <!-- PDFPage:2122 -->permanent easements, 30-year easements, restoration cost share agreements, or any combination of those options.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enrolling land in the wetland reserve established under this subpart during the 1991 through 2007 calendar years, land shall be eligible to be placed into such reserve if the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior at the local level, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such land is farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with adjacent lands that are functionally dependent on such wetlands, except that converted wetlands where the conversion was not commenced prior to December 23, 1985, shall not be eligible to be enrolled in the program under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the program taking into consideration the cost of such restoration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other eligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the wetland reserve established under this subpart, together with land that is eligible under subsection (c) of this section, land that maximizes wildlife benefits and that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) farmed wetland and adjoining lands, enrolled in the conservation reserve, with the highest wetland functions and values, and that are likely to return to production after they leave the conservation reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) other wetland of an owner that would not otherwise be eligible if the Secretary determines that the inclusion of such wetland in such easement would significantly add to the functional value of the easement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) riparian areas that link wetlands that are protected by easements or some other device or circumstance that achieves the same purpose as an easement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Ineligible land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not acquire easements on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) land that contains timber stands established under the conservation reserve under subpart B; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pasture land established to trees under the conservation reserve under subpart B.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination of existing contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may terminate or modify an existing contract entered into under section 3831(a) of this title if eligible land that is subject to such contract is transferred into the program established by this subpart.</p>
