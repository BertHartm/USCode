The yearly plan recommended by the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission and the National Park Service shall become effective when approved by the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Wyoming, and thereupon the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission and the Secretary of the Interior shall issue separately, but simultaneously such appropriate orders and regulations as are necessary to carry out those portions of the approved plan that fall within their respective jurisdictions. Such orders and regulations, to be issued by the Secretary of the Interior and the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission, shall include provision for controlled and managed reduction by qualified and experienced hunters licensed by the State of Wyoming and deputized as rangers by the Secretary of the Interior, if and when a reduction in the number of elk by this method within the Grand Teton National Park established by this Act is required as a part of the approved plan for the year, provided that one elk only may be killed by each such licensed and deputized ranger. Such orders and regulations of the Secretary of the Interior for controlled reduction shall apply only to the <!-- PDFPage:1120 -->lands within the Park which lie east of the Snake River and those lands west of Jackson Lake and the Snake River which lie north of the present north boundaries of Grand Teton National Park, but shall not be applicable to lands within the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park.

<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure the preservation, conservation, and protection of the natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral and faunal, and recreational values of the Big Cypress Watershed in the State of Florida and to provide for the enhancement and public enjoyment thereof, the Big Cypress National Preserve is hereby established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Location; boundaries; publication in Federal Register; area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Big Cypress National Preserve (hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;preserve&rdquo;) shall comprise the <!-- PDFPage:1139 -->area generally depicted on the map entitled &ldquo;Big Cypress National Preserve&rdquo;, dated November 1971 and numbered BC&ndash;91,001, which shall be on file and available for public inspection in the Offices of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, District of Columbia, and shall be filed with appropriate offices of Collier, Monroe, and Dade Counties in the State of Florida. The Secretary of the Interior (hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall, as soon as practicable, publish a detailed description of the boundaries of the preserve in the Federal Register which shall include not more than five hundred and seventy thousand acres of land and water.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Methods of acquisition of land; prerequisites to Federal appropriations; improved property; oil and gas rights; appraisal of property; transfer of Federal property to Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to acquire by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, transfer from any other Federal agency, or exchange, any lands, waters, or interests therein which are located within the boundaries of the preserve or the Addition: <em>Provided</em>, That any lands owned or acquired by the State of Florida, or any of its subdivisions, in the preserve may be acquired by donation only and, any land acquired by the State of Florida, or any of its subdivisions, in the Addition shall be acquired in accordance with subsection (d) of this section: <em>Provided further</em>, That no Federal funds shall be appropriated until the Governor of Florida executes an agreement on behalf of the State which (i) provides for the transfer to the United States of all lands within the preserve previously owned or acquired by the State and (ii) provides for the donation to the United States of all lands acquired by the State within the preserve pursuant to the provision of &ldquo;the Big Cypress Conservation Act of 1973&rdquo; (Chapter 73&ndash;131 of the Florida Statutes) or provides for the donation to the United States of any remaining moneys appropriated pursuant to such Act for the purchase of lands within the preserve. No improved property, as defined by sections 698f to 698m&ndash;4 of this title, nor oil and gas rights, shall be acquired without the consent of the owner unless the Secretary, in his judgment, determines that such property is subject to, or threatened with, uses which are, or would be, detrimental to the purposes of the preserve. The Secretary may, if he determines that the acquisition of any other subsurface estate is not needed for the purposes of the preserve and the Addition, exclude such interest in acquiring any lands within the preserve and the Addition. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4651 of title 42 the Secretary (i) may evaluate any offer to sell land within the preserve or the Addition by any landowner and may, in his discretion, accept any offer not in excess of $10,000 without an appraisal and (ii) may direct an appraisal to be made of any unimproved property within the preserve or the Addition without notice to the owner or owners, thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any federally owned lands within the preserve shall, with the concurrence of the head of the administering agency, be transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for the purposes of sections 698f to 698m&ndash;4 of this title, without transfer of funds. Nothing in sections 698f to 698m&ndash;4 of this title shall be construed to interfere with the right of the State of Florida to acquire such property rights as may be necessary for Interstate 75.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Land within Addition; United States share of acquisition costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The aggregate cost to the United States of acquiring lands within the Addition may not exceed 80 percent of the total cost of such lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the State of Florida transfers to the Secretary lands within the Addition, the Secretary shall pay to or reimburse the State of Florida (out of funds appropriated for such purpose) an amount equal to 80 percent of the total costs to the State of Florida of acquiring such lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount described in paragraph (2) shall be reduced by an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of the total cost incurred by the Secretary in acquiring lands in the Addition other than from the State of Florida.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;total cost&rdquo; means that amount of the total acquisition costs (including the value of exchanged or donated lands) less the amount of the costs incurred by the Federal Highway Administration and the Florida Department of Transportation, including severance damages paid to private property owners as a result of the construction of Interstate 75.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Election of right of use and occupancy; payment of fair market value; termination of right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner of an improved property on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary may, as a condition of such acquisition, retain for himself and his heirs and assigns a right of use of and occupancy of the improved property for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years or, in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of his spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Unless this property is wholly or partially donated to the United States, the Secretary shall pay the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of acquisition less the fair market value, on that date, of the right retained by the owner. A right retained pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his determination that it is being exercised in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of sections 698f to 698m&ndash;4 of this title, which shall include the exercise of such right in violation of any applicable State or local laws and ordinances, and it shall terminate by operation of law upon the Secretary's notifying the holder of the right of such determination and tendering to him an amount equal to the fair market value of that portion of the right which remains unexpired.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any other building, construction of which was begun before November 23, 1971, with respect to the preserve and January 1, 1986, with respect to the Addition which was constructed and is used in accordance with all applicable State and local laws and ordi<!-- PDFPage:1141 -->nances, together with as much of the land on which the building is situated, such land being in the same ownership as the building, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the continued enjoyment and use of the building in the same manner and to the same extent as existed in November 23, 1971, or January 1, 1986, as the case may be, together with any structures accessory to the building which are situated on the lands so designated. In making such designation the Secretary shall take into account the manner of use in which the building, accessory structures, and lands were customarily enjoyed prior to November 23, 1971 or January 1, 1986, as the case may be.<sup><a href="#698h_1_target" name="698h_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of right to relocation assistance by election of right of use and occupancy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an owner of property elects to retain a right of use and occupancy as provided in this section, such owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits or rights accruing under sections 4623, 4624, 4625, and 4626 of title 42, and for the purposes of such sections such owner shall not be considered a displaced person as defined in section 4601(6) of title 42.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Baca ranch comprises most of the Valles Caldera in central New Mexico, and constitutes a unique land mass, with significant scientific, cultural, historic, recreational, ecological, wildlife, fisheries, and productive values;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Valles Caldera is a large resurgent lava dome with potential geothermal activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the land comprising the Baca ranch was originally granted to the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca in 1860;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) historical evidence, in the form of old logging camps and other artifacts, and the history of territorial New Mexico indicate the importance of this land over many generations for domesticated livestock production and timber supply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the careful husbandry of the Baca ranch by the current owners, including selective timbering, limited grazing and hunting, and the use of prescribed fire, have preserved a mix of healthy range and timber land with significant species diversity, thereby serving as a model for sustainable land development and use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Baca ranch's natural beauty and abundant resources, and its proximity to large municipal populations, could provide numerous recreational opportunities for hiking, fishing, camping, cross-country skiing, and hunting;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Forest Service documented the scenic and natural values of the Baca ranch in its 1993 study entitled &ldquo;Report on the Study of the Baca Location No. 1, Santa Fe National Forest, New Mexico&rdquo;, as directed by Public Law 101&ndash;556;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the Baca ranch can be protected for current and future generations by continued operation as a working ranch under a unique management regime which would protect the land and resource values of the property and surrounding ecosystem while allowing and providing for the ranch to eventually become financially self-sustaining;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the current owners have indicated that they wish to sell the Baca ranch, creating an opportunity for Federal acquisition and public access and enjoyment of these lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) certain features on the Baca ranch have historical and religious significance to Native Americans which can be preserved and protected through Federal acquisition of the property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the unique nature of the Valles Caldera and the potential uses of its resources with different resulting impacts warrants a management regime uniquely capable of developing an operational program for appropriate preservation and development of the land and resources of the Baca ranch in the interest of the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) an experimental management regime should be provided by the establishment of a Trust capable of using new methods of public land management that may prove to be cost-effective and environmentally sensitive; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) the Secretary may promote more efficient management of the Valles Caldera and the watershed of the Santa Clara Creek through the assignment of purchase rights of such watershed to the Pueblo of Santa Clara.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of sections 698v to 698v&ndash;10 of this title are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to authorize Federal acquisition of the Baca ranch;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to protect and preserve for future generations the scientific, scenic, historic, and natural values of the Baca ranch, including rivers and ecosystems and archaeological, geological, and cultural resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide opportunities for public recreation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to establish a demonstration area for an experimental management regime adapted to this unique property which incorporates elements of public and private administration in order to promote long term financial sustainability consistent with the other purposes enumerated in this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to provide for sustained yield management of Baca ranch for timber production and domesticated livestock grazing insofar as is consistent with the other purposes stated herein.</p>
