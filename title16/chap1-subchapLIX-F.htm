<h4 class="note-head">Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 302 of title III of div. I of Pub. L. 104&ndash;333 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (94 Stat. 2371 [Pub. L. 96&ndash;487, see Short Title <!-- PDFPage:312 -->note set out under section 3101 of this title]), enacted on December 2, 1980, established Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and Gates of the Arctic Wilderness. The Village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in the highlands of the central Brooks Range is virtually surrounded by these national park and wilderness lands and is the only Native village located within the boundary of a National Park System unit in Alaska.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Unlike most other Alaskan Native communities, the village [sic] of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major river, lake, or coastline that can be used as a means of access. The residents of Anaktuvuk pass [sic] have relied increasingly on snow machines in winter and all-terrain vehicles in summer as their primary means of access to pursue caribou and other subsistence resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In a 1983 land exchange agreement, linear easements were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for use of all-terrain vehicles across certain national park lands, mostly along stream and river banks. These linear easements proved unsatisfactory, because they provided inadequate access to subsistence resources while causing excessive environmental impact from concentrated use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The National Park Service and the Nunamiut Corporation initiated discussions in 1985 to address concerns over the use of all-terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land. These discussions resulted in an agreement, originally executed in 1992 and thereafter amended in 1993 and 1994, among the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, the City of Anaktuvuk Pass, and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Full effectuation of this agreement, as amended, by its terms requires ratification by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Ratification of agreement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Ratification.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The terms, conditions, procedures, covenants, reservations, and other provisions set forth in the document entitled &lsquo;Donation, Exchange of Lands and Interests in Lands and Wilderness Redesignation Agreement Among Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation, City of Anaktuvuk Pass and the United States of America&rsquo; (hereinafter referred to in this section as &lsquo;the Agreement&rsquo;), executed by the parties on December 17, 1992, as amended, are hereby incorporated in this title [see Tables for classification], are ratified and confirmed, and set forth the obligations and commitments of the United States, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation and the City of Anaktuvuk Pass, as a matter of Federal law.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) <cap-smallcap>Land acquisition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Lands acquired by the United States pursuant to the Agreement shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary&rsquo;) as part of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, subject to the laws and regulations applicable thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Maps</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The maps set forth as Exhibits C1, C2, and D through I to the Agreement depict the lands subject to the conveyances, retention of surface access rights, access easements and all-terrain vehicle easements. These lands are depicted in greater detail on a map entitled &lsquo;Land Exchange Actions, Proposed Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange and Wilderness Redesignation, Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve&rsquo;, Map No. 185/80,039, dated April 1994, and on file at the Alaska Regional Office of the National Park Service and the offices of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Fairbanks, Alaska. Written legal descriptions of these lands shall be prepared and made available in the above offices. In case of any discrepancies, Map No. 185/80,039 shall be controlling.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>National Park System Wilderness.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Gates of the artic wilderness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;[Amended provisions listed in a Table of Wilderness Areas set out under section 1132 of this title.]</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Noatak national preserve</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;[Amended this section.]</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Noatak wilderness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;[Amended provisions listed in a Table of Wilderness Areas set out under section 1132 of this title.]</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Conformance With Other Law.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Alaska native claims settlement act</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All of the lands, or interests therein, conveyed to and received by Arctic Slope Regional Corporation or Nunamiut Corporation pursuant to the Agreement shall be deemed conveyed and received pursuant to exchanges under section 22(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1601, 1621(f)). All of the lands or interests in lands conveyed pursuant to the Agreement shall be conveyed subject to valid existing rights.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Alaska national interest lands conservation act</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except to the extent specifically set forth in this section or the Agreement, nothing in this section or in the Agreement shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the rights, privileges, or obligations of any person, including specifically the preference for subsistence uses and access to subsistence resources provided under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.).&rdquo;</p>
