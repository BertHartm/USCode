The funds received from the sale of such stamps by the Department of the Interior shall be deposited in the migratory bird conservation fund in accordance with the provisions of section 718d of this title. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, for each stamp sold under the provisions of this section for any hunting year there shall be collected by the Postal Service a sum of not less than $3 and not more than $5 as determined by the Secretary of the Interior after taking into consideration, among other matters, the increased cost of lands needed for the conservation of migratory birds. No such stamp shall be valid under any circumstances to authorize the taking of migratory waterfowl except in compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations and then only when the person so taking such waterfowl shall himself have written his signature in ink across the face of the stamp prior to such taking. Such stamps shall be usable as migratory-bird hunting stamps only during the year for which issued. The Postal Service, pursuant to regulations prescribed by it, shall provide for the redemption, on or before the 30th day of June of each year, of blocks composed of two or more attached unused stamps issued for such year (A) that were sold on consignment to any person, including, but not limited to, retail dealers for resale to their customers, and (B) that have not been resold by any such person.
