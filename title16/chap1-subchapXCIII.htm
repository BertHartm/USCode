<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the natural, scenic, recreation, historic, and other values of a forty-eight-mile segment of the Chattahoochee River and certain adjoining lands in the State of Georgia from Buford Dam downstream to Peachtree Creek are of special national significance, and that such values should be preserved and protected from developments and uses which would substantially impair or destroy them. In order to assure such preservation and protection for public benefit and enjoyment, there is hereby established the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;recreation area&rdquo;). The recreation area shall consist of the river and its bed together with the lands, waters, and interests therein within the boundary generally depicted on the map entitled &ldquo;Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area&rdquo;, numbered CHAT&ndash;20,003, and dated September 1984, and on the maps entitled &ldquo;Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area Interim Boundary Map #1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area Interim Boundary Map #2&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area Interim Boundary Map #3&rdquo;, and dated August 6, 1998, which shall be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior. No sooner than 180 days after December 9, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior (hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may modify the boundaries of the recreation area to include other land within the Chattahoochee River corridor by submitting a revised map or other boundary description to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives. The revised map or other boundary description shall be prepared by the Secretary after consultation with affected landowners, the State of Georgia, and affected political subdivisions of the State. The revised boundaries shall take effect 180 days after the date of submission unless, within the 180-day period, Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the revised boundaries. The total area, exclusive of the river and its bed, within the recreation area may not exceed 10,000 acres. For purposes of facilitating Federal technical and other support to State and local gov<!-- PDFPage:664 -->ernments to assist State and local efforts to protect the scenic, recreational, and natural values of a 2,000 foot wide corridor adjacent to each bank of the Chattahoochee River and its impoundments in the 48-mile segment referred to above, such corridor is hereby declared to be an area of national concern.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Manner of acquisition of lands, etc., within area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within the recreation area the Secretary is authorized to acquire lands, waters, and interests therein by donation, purchase from willing sellers with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. Property owned by the State of Georgia or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Manner of acquisition of lands partly within and partly without area; disposal of unutilized lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a tract of land lies partly within and partly without the boundaries of the recreation area, the Secretary may acquire the entire tract by any of the above methods in order to avoid the payment of severance costs. Land so acquired outside of the boundaries of the recreation area may be exchanged by the Secretary for non-Federal land within such boundaries, and any portion of the land not utilized for such exchanges may be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and <!-- PDFPage:665 -->Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acquisition of improved property used for noncommercial residential purposes; retention by owners of right of use and occupancy for residential purposes; terms; payment of fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except for property which the Secretary determines to be necessary for the purposes of administration, development, access, or public use, an owner of improved property which is used solely for noncommercial residential purposes on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary may retain, as a condition of such acquisition, a right of use and occupancy of the property for such residential purposes. The right retained may be for a definite term which shall not exceed twenty-five years or, in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of the spouse, whichever occurs later. The owner shall elect the term to be retained. The Secretary shall pay the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the fair market value of the term retained by the owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms and conditions respecting rights of use and occupancy retained; termination of right of use and occupancy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any right of use and occupancy retained pursuant to this section may, during its existence, be conveyed or transferred, but all rights of use and occupancy shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate to assure the use of the property in accordance with the purposes of this subchapter. Upon his determination that the property, or any portion thereof, has ceased to be so used in accordance with such terms and conditions, the Secretary may terminate the right of use and occupancy by tendering to the holder of such right an amount equal to the fair market value, as of the date of the tender, of that portion of the right which remains unexpired on the date of termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Improved property&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;improved property&rdquo; means a detached, year-round noncommercial residential dwelling, the construction of which was begun before January 1, 1975, together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated, the said land being in the same ownership as the dwelling, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures accessory to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Limitations on licensing and assistance authorities; criteria for upgrading, improving, etc., supply and quality enhancement programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall not license the construction of any dam, water conduit, reservoir, powerhouse, transmission line, or other project works under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.), on or directly affecting the recreation area, and no department or agency of the United States shall assist by loan, grant, license, or otherwise in the construction of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which such area is established, except where such project is determined by the State of Georgia to be necessary for water supply or water quality enhancement purposes and authorized by the United States Congress. Nothing contained in the foregoing sentence, however, shall preclude licensing of, or assistance to, developments upstream or downstream from the recreation area or on any stream tributary thereto which will not invade the recreation area or unreasonably diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish and wildlife values present therein on August 15, 1978. Nothing contained in this subsection shall preclude the upgrading, improvement, expansion or development of facilities or public works for water supply or water quality enhancement purposes if such action would not have a material adverse effect on the values for which the recreation area is established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on recommending authorizations and requesting appropriations; applicability of local considerations and criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No department or agency of the United States shall recommend authorization of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which such area is established, as determined by the Secretary, nor shall such department or agency request appropriations to begin construction of any such project, whether heretofore or hereafter authorized, without at least sixty days in advance, (1) advising the Secretary in writing of its intention to do so and (2) reporting to the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives and to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate the nature of the project involved and the manner in which such project would conflict with the purposes of this subchapter or would affect the recreation area and the values to be protected by it under this subchapter. It is not the intention of Congress by this subchapter to require the manipulation or reduction of lake water levels in Lake Sidney Lanier. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed in any way to restrict, prohibit, or affect any recommendation of the Metropolitan Atlanta Water Resources Study as authorized by the Public Works Committee of the United States Senate on March 2, 1972.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Expeditious acquisition of lands and interests in lands necessary for establishment, etc., of area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is directed to proceed as expeditiously as possible to acquire the lands and interests in lands necessary to achieve the purposes of this subchapter and chapter 43 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mitigation funds for adverse impacts; excepted lands; limitation of amount; replacement lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other authority of law, any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of the State of Georgia, or any other entity which may construct any project recommended in the study entitled &ldquo;Metropolitan Atlanta Water Resources Management Study, Georgia: Report of Chief of Engineers,&rdquo; dated June 1, 1982, which directly adversely impacts any lands within the authorized recreation boundaries of the Bowman's Island tract as shown on the map numbered and dated CHAT&ndash;20,003, September 1984, which were in Federal ownership as of September 1, 1984, shall, upon request by the Secretary, mitigate such adverse impacts. It is expressly provided that use of or adverse impact upon any other lands within the recreation area as result of any such project shall not require mitigation. Mitigation required by this paragraph shall be provided by payment to the United States of a sum not to exceed $3,200,000. The mitigation funds paid pursuant to this paragraph shall be utilized by the Secretary for the acquisition of replacement lands. Such replacement lands shall be acquired <!-- PDFPage:667 -->only after consultation with the Governor of Georgia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In acquiring replacement lands under paragraph (1) priority shall be given to acquisition of lands within the recreation area boundary and those lands within or adjacent to the 2,000 foot wide corridor referred to in section 460ii of this title. Any lands acquired pursuant to this subsection lying outside the boundaries of the recreation area shall, upon acquisition, be included within the recreation area and transferred to the Secretary for management under this subchapter. The Secretary shall publish a revised boundary map to include any lands added to the recreation area pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If lands as described in paragraph (2) are not available for acquisition, other lands within the State of Georgia may be acquired as replacement lands under paragraph (1) if such lands are transferred to the State of Georgia for permanent management for public outdoor recreation.</p>
