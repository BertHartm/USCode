<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such initial evaluation shall consist of procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to determine whether a child is a child with a disability (as defined in section 1401(3) of this title); and</p>

Parental consent for evaluation shall not be construed as consent for placement for receipt of special education and related services.</p>
