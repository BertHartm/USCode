<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Such initial evaluation shall consist of procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to determine whether a child is a child with a disability (as defined in 1401 of this title) within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or, if the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be conducted, within such timeframe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to determine the educational needs of such child.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
