<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) of such subparagraph shall not apply to an eligible lender as described in section 1085(d)(1)(D) of this title for the fiscal year in which such lender begins to carry on a loan program insured by the Secretary, or for any of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.</p>
