<p class="statutory-body-1em">The remainder of the amount so appropriated (after meeting requirements in subsection (a) of this section) shall be allotted among State educational agencies so that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) one-half of such remainder shall be distributed by allotting to each State educational agency an amount which bears the same ratio to such one-half of such remainder as the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the State bears to the number of such children in all States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) one-half of such remainder shall be distributed according to each State's share of allocations under part A of subchapter I of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any State educational agency's allotment under subsection (b) of this section for any fiscal year to carry out this part which the Secretary determines will not be required for that fiscal year to carry out this part shall be available for reallotment from time to time, on such dates during that year as the Secretary may determine, to other State educational agencies in proportion to the original allotments to those State educational agencies under subsection (b) of this section for that year but with such proportionate amount for any of those other State educational agencies being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates that the State educational agency needs and will be able to use for that year, and the total of those reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the State educational agencies whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amounts reallotted to a State educational agency under this subsection during a year shall be deemed a part of the State educational agency's allotment under subsection (b) of this section for that year.</p>
