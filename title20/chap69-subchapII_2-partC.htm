<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) underlying the standards-driven framework of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.] and the high academic standards for eligible students under subchapter I of this chapter is a widespread need to prepare teachers to teach to higher standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prospective and current teachers need knowledge and skills beyond what such teachers currently possess;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) while both the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.] and subchapters I and II of this chapter have extensive references to professional development of teachers, there are no provisions to incorporate &ldquo;on-the-ground&rdquo; planning and implementation to serve as models for local educational agencies across the Nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) better prepared teachers can lead to improved student achievement, especially for students who are furthest from reaching high standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to address the need for professional development with a primary focus on teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide both prospective teachers and current teachers opportunities to learn both the content and the pedagogy needed to teach to high standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to build models, in a few cities and States, that demonstrate new organizational arrangements and deep investments in teachers necessary to better prepare teachers for new standards and assessments.</p>
