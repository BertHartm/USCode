<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) School readiness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) By the year 2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) children will receive the nutrition, physical activity experiences, and health care needed to arrive at school with healthy minds and bodies, and to maintain the mental alertness necessary to be prepared to learn, and the number of low-birthweight babies will be significantly reduced through enhanced prenatal health systems.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) School completion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) By the year 2000, the high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent.</p>
