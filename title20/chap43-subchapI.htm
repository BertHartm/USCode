<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that any amount of any State's allotment under subsection (a) of this section for any fiscal year will not be required for such fiscal year for carrying out the program for which such amount has been allotted, the Secretary shall make such amount available for reallotment. Any such reallotment among other States shall occur on such dates during the same year as the Secretary shall fix, and shall be made on the basis of criteria established by regulation. No funds may be reallotted for any use other than the use for which they were appropriated. Any amount reallotted to a State under this subsection for any fiscal year shall remain available for obligation during the succeeding fiscal year and shall be deemed to be part of its allotment for the year in which it is obligated.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The allotment ratios shall be promulgated by the Secretary for each fiscal year between October 1 and December 31 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made. Allotment ratios shall be computed on the basis of the average of the appropriate per capita incomes for the three most recent consecutive fiscal years for which satisfactory data are available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The term &ldquo;per capita income&rdquo; means, with respect to a fiscal year, the total personal income in the calendar year ending in such year, divided by the population of the area concerned in such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purposes of this section, population shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the latest estimates available to the Department.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;State&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; means any 1 of the 50 States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
