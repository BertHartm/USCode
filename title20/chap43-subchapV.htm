No level of funding permitted under such a waiver may be used as the basis for computing the fiscal effort required under this section for years subsequent to the year covered by such waiver; such fiscal effort shall be computed on the basis of the level of funding which would, but for such waiver, have been required.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a regulation must be issued within a very limited time period to assist States and eligible recipients with the operation of a program under this chapter, the Secretary may issue a regulation without fulfilling the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, but shall immediately convene regional meetings to review the regulation before such regulation is issued in final form.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Advisory Committee Act shall not apply to activities carried out under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reservation of amounts</h4>
