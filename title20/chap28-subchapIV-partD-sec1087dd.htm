<p class="statutory-body">(2) No compromise repayment of a defaulted loan as authorized by paragraph (1) may be made unless the student borrower pays&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded, because of that discharge, from receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 for which the borrower would be otherwise eligible (but for the default on the discharged loan).

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Comparable conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As long as the borrower continues to make scheduled repayments on a loan rehabilitated under this paragraph, the rehabilitated loan shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, and qualify for the same benefits and privileges, as other loans made under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Additional assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The borrower of a rehabilitated loan shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (for which the borrower is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide for a discount on the balance owed on a loan on which the borrower pays <!-- PDFPage:442 -->the principal and interest in full prior to the end of the applicable repayment period, but in no event may the discount exceed 5 percent of the unpaid principal balance due on the loan at the time the early repayment is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) include such other incentive repayment options as the institution determines will carry out the objectives of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
