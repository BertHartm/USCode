<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Over 150,000 youth offenders age 21 and younger are incarcerated in the Nation's jails, juvenile facilities, and prisons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Most youth offenders who are incarcerated have been sentenced as first-time adult felons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Approximately 75 percent of youth offenders are high school dropouts who lack basic literacy and life skills, have little or no job experience, and lack marketable skills.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The average incarcerated youth has attended school only through grade 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Most of these youths can be diverted from a life of crime into productive citizenship with available educational, vocational, work skills, and related service programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) If not involved with educational programs while incarcerated, almost all of these youths will return to a life of crime upon release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The average length of sentence for a youth offender is about 3 years. Time spent in prison provides a unique opportunity for education and training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Even with quality education and training provided during incarceration, a period of intense supervision, support, and counseling is needed upon release to ensure effective reintegration of youth offenders into society.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:562 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Research consistently shows that the vast majority of incarcerated youths will not return to the public schools to complete their education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) There is a need for alternative educational opportunities during incarceration and after release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Youth offender&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;youth offender&rdquo; means a male or female offender under the age of 25, who is incarcerated in a State prison, including a prerelease facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a program in accordance with this section to provide grants to the State correctional education agencies to assist and encourage incarcerated youths to acquire functional literacy, life, and job skills, through the pursuit of a postsecondary education certificate, or an associate of arts or bachelor's degree while in prison, and employment counseling and other related services which start during incarceration and continue through prerelease and while on parole.</p>
