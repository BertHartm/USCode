<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Information and training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Proportionate to the number of children in a State or in a local educational agency who are enrolled in private elementary or secondary schools&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a State educational agency or local educational agency which uses funds under this subchapter to develop goals, State content standards or State student performance standards, curricular materials, and State assessments shall, upon request, make information related to such goals, standards, materials, and assessments available to private schools; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a State educational agency or local educational agency which uses funds under this subchapter for teacher and administrator training shall provide in the State improvement plan described in section 5886 of this title for the training of teachers and administrators in private schools located in the geographical area served by such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, by reason of any provision of law, a State or local educational agency is prohibited from providing for the equitable participation of teachers and administrators from private schools in training programs assisted with Federal funds provided under this subchapter, or if the Secretary determines that a State or local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling to provide for such participation, the Secretary shall waive such requirements and shall arrange for the provision of training consistent with State goals and State content standards for such teachers and administrators. Such waivers shall be subject to consultation, withholding, notice, and judicial review in accordance with sections 6321&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5890_1_target" name="5890_1">1</a></sup> and 8893 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 6321 of this title, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original a reference to section 1020 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, meaning section 1020 of Pub. L. 89&ndash;10, which was translated as reading section 1120 of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 89&ndash;10 does not contain a section 1020, but it does contain a section 1120 relating to participation of children enrolled in private schools.</p>
