For the purpose of assisting such organizations in complying with the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], such agreements may provide for timely response by the Secretary (concerning loans covered by Federal loan insurance), by a guaranty agency, eligible lender, or subsequent holder (concerning loans covered by a guaranty agreement), or to requests from such organizations for responses to objections raised by borrowers. Subject to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, such agreements shall require the Secretary, the guaranty agency, eligible lender, or subsequent holder, as appropriate, to disclose to such organizations, with respect to any loan under this part that has not been repaid by the borrower&mdash;</p>
