<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States faces a shortage of skilled professionals with higher levels of proficiency in foreign languages and area knowledge critical to the Nation's security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Given the Nation's economic competitiveness interests, it is crucial that our Nation expand the number of Americans who are able to function effectively in the environments in which critical foreign languages are spoken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Students&rsquo; ability to become proficient in foreign languages can be addressed by starting language learning at a younger age and expanding opportunities for continuous foreign language education from elementary school through postsecondary education.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to significantly increase&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the opportunities to study critical foreign languages and the context in which the critical foreign languages are spoken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the number of American students who achieve the highest level of proficiency in critical foreign languages.</p>
