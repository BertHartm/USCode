<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In order to improve the American educational system for all students, achieve the National Education Goals, and provide for greater educational equity, policymakers, administrators, teachers, and parents must have ready access to the best information and methods available as a result of educational research and development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Office of Educational Research and Improvement should have as one of its primary purposes the dissemination of such information and methods in order to assist the national education reform effort.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) All current resources within the Office, the Department of Education, and other agencies that can help accomplish the purposes described in subparagraph (B) should be coordinated by the Assistant Secretary, to the extent practicable, so as to form a systematic process to accomplish such purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Education research has the capacity to improve teaching and learning in our Nation's schools, however, teachers need training in the skills necessary to translate research into practice and to allow teachers to become knowledgeable practitioners and leaders in educational improvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Adequate linkages between research and development providers and practitioners are essential to ensuring that research on effective practice is useful, disseminated to and supported with technical assistance for all educators, and that all educators are partners in the research and development process.</p>
