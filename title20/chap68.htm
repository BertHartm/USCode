<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) simultaneous top-down and bottom-up education reform is necessary to spur creative and innovative approaches by individual schools to help all students achieve internationally competitive standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) strategies must be developed by communities and States to support the revitalization of all local public schools by fundamentally changing the entire system of public education through comprehensive, coherent, and coordinated improvement in order to increase student learning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) parents, teachers, and other local educators, and business, community, and tribal leaders must be involved in developing systemwide improvement strategies that reflect the needs of their individual communities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) States and local educational agencies, working together, must immediately set about developing and implementing such systemwide <!-- PDFPage:1042 -->improvement strategies if our Nation is to educate all children to meet their full potential and achieve the National Education Goals described in subchapter I of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) State and local systemic improvement strategies must provide all students with effective mechanisms and appropriate paths to the work force as well as to higher education;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to enter into partnerships with schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide information and guidance to schools based on the needs of area businesses for properly educated graduates in general and on the need for particular workplace skills that the schools may provide;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to provide necessary education and training materials and support; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to continue the lifelong learning process throughout the employment years of an individual;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) schools should provide information to businesses regarding how the business community can assist schools in meeting the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) institutions of higher education should be encouraged to enter into partnerships with schools to provide information and guidance to schools on the skills and knowledge graduates need in order to enter and successfully complete postsecondary education, and schools should provide information and guidance to institutions of higher education on the skills, knowledge, and preservice training teachers need, and the types of professional development educators need in order to meet the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) the appropriate and innovative use of technology, including distance learning, can be very effective in helping to provide all students with the opportunity to learn and meet high standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Federal funds should be targeted to support State and local initiatives, and to leverage State and local resources for designing and implementing systemwide education improvement plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) all students are entitled to participate in a broad and challenging curriculum and to have access to resources sufficient to address other education needs; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Congress is interested in promoting State and local government reform efforts in education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In Public Law 96  88 [20 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.] the Congress found that education is fundamental to the development of individual citizens and the progress of the Nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In Public Law 96  88 the Congress found that in our Federal system the responsibility for education is reserved respectively to the States and the local school systems and other instrumentalities of the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In Public Law 96  88 the Congress declared the purpose of the Department of Education was to supplement and complement the efforts of States, the local school systems, and other instrumentalities of the States, the private sector, public and private educational institutions, public and private nonprofit educational research institutions, community based organizations, parents and schools to improve the quality of education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) With the establishment of the Department of Education, Congress intended to protect the rights of State and local governments and public and private educational institutions in the areas of educational policies and administration of programs and to strengthen and improve the control of such governments and institutions over their own educational programs and policies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Public Law 96 88 specified that the establishment of the Department of Education shall not increase the authority of the Federal Government over education or diminish the responsibility for education which is reserved to the States and local school systems and other instrumentalities of the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Public Law 96 88 specified that no provision of a program administered by the Secretary or by any other officer of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare<sup><a href="#5899_1_target" name="5899_1">1</a></sup> shall be construed to authorize the Secretary or any such officer to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system, over any accrediting agency or association or over the selection or content of library resources, textbooks, or other instructional materials by any educational institution or school system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reaffirmation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress agrees and reaffirms that the responsibility for control of education is reserved to the States and local school systems and other instrumentalities of the States and that no action shall be taken under the provisions of this chapter by the Federal Government which would, directly or indirectly, impose standards or requirements of any kind through the promulgation of rules, regulations, provision of financial assistance and otherwise, which would reduce, modify, or undercut State and local responsibility for control of education.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish a National Skill Standards Board to serve as a catalyst in stimulating the development and adoption of a voluntary national system of skill standards and of assessment and certification of attainment of skill standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that will serve as a cornerstone of the national strategy to enhance workforce skills;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that will result in increased productivity, economic growth, and American economic competitiveness; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that can be used, consistent with civil rights laws&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by the Nation, to ensure the development of a high skills, high quality, high performance workforce, including the most skilled frontline workforce in the world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by industries, as a vehicle for informing training providers and prospective employees of skills necessary for employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by employers, to assist in evaluating the skill levels of prospective employees and to assist in the training of current employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) by labor organizations, to enhance the employment security of workers by providing portable credentials and skills;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) by workers, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) obtain certifications of their skills to protect against dislocation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) pursue career advancement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) enhance their ability to reenter the workforce;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6002. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows with respect to improving education in the United States:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A majority of public schools in the United States are failing to prepare students to achieve the National Education Goals. The Federal Government should support an extensive program of educational research, development, dissemination, replication and assistance to identify and support the best responses for the challenges ahead. A significant investment in attaining a deeper understanding of the processes of learning and schooling and developing new ideas holds the best hope of making a substantial difference to the lives of every student in the United States. The Office of Educational Research and Improvement within the Department of Education should be at the center of this campaign in order to coordinate such efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal role in educational research has been closely identified with youths who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, are minorities, belong to a language minority, or have a disability. The Federal commitment to education was sufficient to serve not more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in 1993, 1 out of every 6 low-income children in need of preschool education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in 1990, 3 out of every 5 children in need of remediation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in 1991, 1 out of every 5 children in need of bilingual education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in 1992, 1 out of every 20 youths eligible for assistance under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.].</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The failure of the Federal Government to adequately invest in educational research and development has denied the United States a sound foundation of knowledge on which to design school improvements. The educational achievement of minority children is of particular concern because at least half of the public school students in 25 of the largest cities of the United States are minority children, and demographers project that, by the year 2005, almost all urban public school students will be minority children or other children in poverty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The investment goal of the Federal research, development, and dissemination function should be at least 1 percent of the total amount of funds spent on education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Nationwide model programs and reliable interventions should be demonstrated and replicated, and for such purposes, programs should be established to conduct research and evaluations, and to disseminate information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Office should develop a national dissemination policy that will advance the goal of placing a national treasure chest of research results, models, and materials at the disposal of the education decisionmakers of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board should be established to work collaboratively with the Assistant Secretary to forge a national consensus with respect to a long-term agenda for educational research, development, dissemination, and the activities of the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Existing research and development entities should adopt expanded, proactive roles and new institutions should be created to promote knowledge development necessary to accelerate the application of research findings to high priority areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Greater use should be made of existing technologies in efforts to improve the educational system of the United States, including efforts to disseminate research findings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Minority educational researchers are inadequately represented throughout the Department of Education, but particularly in the Office. The Office therefore should assume a leadership position in the recruitment, retention, and promotion of qualified minority educational researchers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The coordination of the mission of the Office with that of other components of the Department of Education is critical. The Of<!-- PDFPage:1076 -->fice should improve the coordination of the educational research, development, and dissemination function with those of other Federal agencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress declares it to be the policy of the United States to provide to every individual an equal opportunity to receive an education of high quality regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, national origin, or social class. Although the American educational system has pursued this objective, it has not been attained. Inequalities of opportunity to receive high quality education remain pronounced. To achieve the goal of quality education requires the continued pursuit of knowledge about education through research, development, improvement activities, data collection, synthesis, technical assistance, and information dissemination. While the direction of American education remains primarily the responsibility of State and local governments, the Federal Government has a clear responsibility to provide leadership in the conduct and support of scientific inquiry into the educational process.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) National Institute on Student Achievement, Curriculum, and Assessment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The current achievement levels of students in the United States are far below those that might indicate competency in challenging subject matter in core content areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) During the last 20 years, relatively little changed in how students were taught. Despite much research suggesting better alternatives, classrooms continue to be dominated by textbooks, teacher lectures, short-answer activity sheets, and unequal patterns of student attention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Despite progress in narrowing the gaps, the differences in performance between Caucasian students and their minority counterparts remain unacceptably large. While progress has been made in reducing the gender gap in mathematics, such gap still remains at higher levels of problem solving. Too little progress has been made in reducing gender performance gaps favoring males in science and females in writing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of the National Institute on Student Achievement, Curriculum, and Assessment is to carry out a coordinated and comprehensive program of research and development to provide research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve student achievement in core content areas and the integration of such areas.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) National Institute on the Education of At-Risk Students</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The rate of decline in our urban schools is escalating at a rapid pace. Student performance in most inner city schools grows worse each year. At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate 4 years later and many more students from high-poverty backgrounds leave school with skills that are inadequate for today's workplace. Student performance in many inner city neighborhoods grows worse each year. At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate in 4 years. In 1992, the average National Assessment of Educational Progress reading score of Caucasian 17 year-olds was approximately 25 points higher than that of African-American 17 year-olds and 20 points higher than that of Hispanic 17 year-olds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Rural schools enroll a disproportionately large share of the poor and at-risk students of the United States and yet often lack the means to address effectively the needs of these children. Intensive efforts should be made to overcome the problems of geographic isolation, declining population, inadequate financial resources and other impediments to the educational success of children residing in rural areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) By the year 2000, an estimated 3,400,000 school age children with limited-English proficiency will be entering the school system. The Federal Government should develop effective policies and programs to address the educational needs of this growing population of children who are at increased risk of educational failure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) An educational emergency exists in those urban and rural areas where there are large concentrations of children who live in poverty. The numbers of disadvantaged children will substantially increase by the year 2020, when the number of impoverished children alone will be 16,500,000, a 33 percent increase over the 12,400,000 children in poverty in 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) American Indian and Alaska Native students have high dropout, illiteracy and poverty rates, and experience cultural, linguistic, social and geographic isolation. The estimated 400,000 Indian and Alaska Native student population from over 500 Indian and Alaska Native tribes, is small and scattered throughout remote reservations and villages in 32 States, and in off-reservation rural and urban communities where Indians constitute but a small percentage of public school student bodies. To meaningfully address the special educational needs of this historically under-served population, the existing research and development system should be opened to Indian and Alaska Native people to identify needs and design ways to address such needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Minority scholars as well as institutions and groups that have been historically committed to the improvement of the education of at-risk students need to be more fully mobilized in the effort to develop a new generation of programs, models, practices, and schools capable of responding to the urgent needs of students who are educationally at-risk.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be the purpose of the Institute on the Education of At-Risk Students to carry <!-- PDFPage:1088 -->out a coordinated and comprehensive program of research and development to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve educational opportunities for at-risk students.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">All research and development activities supported by the Institute which relate to the education of Indian and Alaska Native students shall be developed in close consultation with Indian and Alaska Native researchers and educators, Tribally Controlled Community Colleges, tribal departments of education, and others with expertise in the needs of Indian and Native Alaska students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National Institute on Early Childhood Development and Education</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Despite efforts to expand and improve preschool programs, many children still reach school age unprepared to benefit from formal education programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Early intervention for disadvantaged children from birth to age five has been shown to be a highly cost-effective strategy for reducing later expenditures on a wide variety of health, developmental, and educational problems that often interfere with learning. Long-term studies of the benefits of preschool education have a demonstrated return on investment ranging from three to six dollars for every one dollar spent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Federal Government should play a central role in providing research-based information on early childhood education <!-- PDFPage:1089 -->models which enhance children's development and ultimately their success in school.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Many elementary and secondary schools in the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are structured according to models that are ineffective and rely on notions of management and governance that may be outdated or insufficient for the challenges of the next century; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are unsuccessful in equipping all students with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed as citizens and in the working world.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) New approaches are needed in the governance and management of elementary and secondary education within the United States at the State, local, school building and classroom level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Not enough is known about the effects of various systems of school governance and management on student achievement to provide sound guidance to policymakers as such policymakers pursue school restructuring and reform.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A concentrated Federal effort is needed to support research, development, demonstration, and evaluation of approaches to school governance, finance and management which promise to improve education equity and excellence throughout the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be the purpose of the National Institute on Educational Governance, Finance, Policy-Making, and Management to carry out a coordinated and comprehensive program of research and development to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve student achievement through school restructuring and reform. Such program shall undertake research necessary to provide a sound basis from which to identify, develop and evaluate approaches in elementary and secondary school governance, finance, policy-making, and management at the State, local, tribal, school building and classroom level which promise to improve educational equity and excellence, such as&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The American system of postsecondary education is foremost in the world in such system's achievement of both academic excellence and equity in access, but maintaining that preeminence requires renewed efforts to strengthen the quality of postsecondary education. Disappointing student performance on achievement tests and licensure examinations, declining rates of postsecondary education persistence and completion among minorities, and other troubling trends in the quality of postsecondary education should be addressed by the United States as part of its overall drive to improve American education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The need to improve our economic productivity of the United States to meet the competitive challenges of a new, international economy, coupled with high levels of mobility in the United States labor market and demographic changes in the workforce, now demands more and higher quality programs of learning and training in the American workplace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The more than 1,000,000 men and women incarcerated in the prisons and jails in the United States are among the most severely educationally disadvantaged in the United States, with high rates of functional illiteracy and extremely low levels of educational attainment. Since an estimated 90 percent of these individuals are expected to be released by the end of the decade, the United States must act to assure that our correctional system has the means to equip these Americans with the knowledge and skills they will need to participate productively in our society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The development of a &ldquo;Nation of Students&rdquo; capable of and committed to the pursuit of formal and informal lifelong learning and literacy is essential to sustain both national and individual economic success and to provide a nurturing environment in which all children and youth can learn and achieve. Historically the most effective community resource for lifelong learning, the public library system of the United States, should expand and restructure its delivery of services to take full advantage of the potential of new information technologies to meet the needs of learning communities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of the National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning is to promote greater coordination of Federal research and development on issues related to adult learning and to carry out a program of research and development in adult learning to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve libraries, postsecondary education, literacy, and lifelong learning throughout the United States. Such program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall only support research and development in those areas of postsecondary education, libraries, literacy, and lifelong learning which are not being addressed by other entities within the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may include basic and applied research, development, replication, and evaluation activities in areas such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) methods of assessing and evaluating individual, program, and institutional performance;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(x) new models of service delivery for public library systems which expand opportunities for lifelong learning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xi) effective programs and approaches which promote greater access to and success by minorities in postsecondary programs which prepare such minorities for scientific, technical, teaching, and health career fields;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xii) effective teaching for the preparation and continuing education of teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xiii) the development and evaluation of curricular materials for the initial and continuing education of teachers and teacher educators;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xiv) the role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Indian Community Colleges, women's colleges, and other special mission institutions in providing access, excellence, and equal opportunity in higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xv) methods for evaluating the quality of education at different types of institutions of higher education at all levels and the roles and responsibilities of regional and national accrediting agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xvi) methods for evaluating the productivity of different types of institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xvii) financial barriers to postsecondary educational opportunity, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the role of Federal programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] and State grant and work programs in mitigating such barriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the impact of the rising total cost of postsecondary education on access to higher education; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In order to improve the American educational system for all students, achieve the National Education Goals, and provide for greater educational equity, policymakers, administrators, teachers, and parents must have ready access to the best information and methods available as a result of educational research and development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Office of Educational Research and Improvement should have as one of its primary purposes the dissemination of such information and methods in order to assist the national education reform effort.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) All current resources within the Office, the Department of Education, and other agencies that can help accomplish the purposes described in subparagraph (B) should be coordinated by the Assistant Secretary, to the extent practicable, so as to form a systematic process to accomplish such purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Education research has the capacity to improve teaching and learning in our Nation's schools, however, teachers need training in the skills necessary to translate research into practice and to allow teachers to become knowledgeable practitioners and leaders in educational improvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Adequate linkages between research and development providers and practitioners are essential to ensuring that research on effective practice is useful, disseminated to and supported with technical assistance for all educators, and that all educators are partners in the research and development process.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] was established with the commitment of forty percent Federal funding but currently receives only eight percent Federal funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this funding shortfall is particularly burdensome to school districts and schools in low-income areas which serve higher than average proportions of students with disabilities and have fewer local resources to contribute; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it would cost the Federal Government approximately $10,000,000,000 each year to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Government should provide States and communities with adequate resources under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] as soon as reasonably possible, through the reallocation of noneducation funds within the current budget monetary constraints.</p>

Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Administrative proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A civil penalty may be assessed in a written notice, or an administrative compliance order may be issued, by the Secretary only after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5. Before making such assessment or issuing such order, or both, the Secretary shall give written notice thereof to such person by certified mail with return receipt and provide therein an opportunity to request in writing not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice such hearing. The notice shall reasonably describe the violation and be accompanied with the procedures for such hearing and a simple form to request such hearing if such person desires to use such form. If a hearing is requested, the Secretary shall establish by such certified notice the time and place for such hearing which should be located, to the greatest extent possible, at a location convenient to such person.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to the violator, any good faith efforts to comply, the importance of achieving early and permanent compliance, the ability to pay or comply, the effect of the penalty or order on the ability to continue operation, any prior history of the same kind of violation, the degree of culpability, and any demonstration of willingness to comply with the prohibitions of this section in a timely manner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Modification</h4>

Such person shall provide a copy thereof to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. The petition shall be filed within 30 days after the Secretary's assessment or order, or both, are final and have been provided to such person by certified mail. The Secretary shall promptly provide to the court a certified copy of the transcript of any hearing held under this section and a copy of the notice or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty or comply with an order, after either or both are final under this section, or after a court under paragraph (5) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Attorney General, at the request of the Secretary, shall recover the amount of the civil penalty (plus interest at then currently prevailing rates from the day either or both are final) or enforce the order in an action brought in the appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the penalty or order or the amount of the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
