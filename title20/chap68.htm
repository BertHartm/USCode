<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;25, &sect;2, Apr. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 41, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) States differ substantially in demographics, in school governance, and in school finance and funding. The administrative and funding mechanisms that help schools in one State improve may not prove successful in other States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Although the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] and other Federal education statutes afford flexibility to State educational agencies and local educational agencies in implementing Federal programs, certain requirements of Federal education statutes or regulations may impede local efforts to reform and improve education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) By granting waivers of certain statutory and regulatory requirements, the Federal Government can remove impediments for local educational agencies in implementing educational reforms and raising the achievement levels of all children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) State educational agencies are closer to local school systems, implement statewide educational reforms with both Federal and State funds, and are responsible for maintaining accountability for local activities consistent with State standards and assessment systems. Therefore, State educational agencies are often in the best position to align waivers of Federal and State requirements with State and local initiatives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act [former 20 U.S.C. 5891(e)] allows State educational agencies the flexibility to waive certain Federal requirements, along with related State requirements, but allows only 12 States to qualify for such waivers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Expansion of waiver authority will allow for the waiver of statutory and regulatory requirements that impede implementation of State and local educational improvement plans, or that unnecessarily burden program administration, while maintaining the intent and purposes of affected programs, such as the important focus on improving mathematics and science performance under title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.] (Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program), and maintaining such fundamental requirements as those relating to civil rights, educational equity, and accountability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) To achieve the State goals for the education of children in the State, the focus must be on results in raising the achievement of all students, not process.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6002. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows with respect to improving education in the United States:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A majority of public schools in the United States are failing to prepare students to achieve the National Education Goals. The Federal Government should support an extensive program of educational research, development, dissemination, replication and assistance to identify and support the best responses for the challenges ahead. A significant investment in attaining a deeper understanding of the processes of learning and schooling and developing new ideas holds the best hope of making a substantial difference to the lives of every student in the United States. The Office of Educational Research and Improvement within the Department of Education should be at the center of this campaign in order to coordinate such efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal role in educational research has been closely identified with youths who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, are minorities, belong to a language minority, or have a disability. The Federal commitment to education was sufficient to serve not more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in 1993, 1 out of every 6 low-income children in need of preschool education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in 1990, 3 out of every 5 children in need of remediation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in 1991, 1 out of every 5 children in need of bilingual education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in 1992, 1 out of every 20 youths eligible for assistance under the Job Training Partnership Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The failure of the Federal Government to adequately invest in educational research and development has denied the United States a sound foundation of knowledge on which to design school improvements. The educational achievement of minority children is of particular concern because at least half of the public school students in 25 of the largest cities of the United States are minority children, and demographers project that, by the year 2005, almost all urban public school students will be minority children or other children in poverty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The investment goal of the Federal research, development, and dissemination function should be at least 1 percent of the total amount of funds spent on education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Nationwide model programs and reliable interventions should be demonstrated and replicated, and for such purposes, programs should be established to conduct research and evaluations, and to disseminate information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Office should develop a national dissemination policy that will advance the goal of placing a national treasure chest of research results, models, and materials at the disposal of the education decisionmakers of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board should be established to work collaboratively with the Assistant Secretary to forge a national consensus with respect to a long-term agenda for educational research, development, dissemination, and the activities of the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Existing research and development entities should adopt expanded, proactive roles and new institutions should be created to promote knowledge development necessary to accelerate the application of research findings to high priority areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Greater use should be made of existing technologies in efforts to improve the educational system of the United States, including efforts to disseminate research findings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Minority educational researchers are inadequately represented throughout the Department of Education, but particularly in the Office. The Office therefore should assume a leadership position in the recruitment, retention, and promotion of qualified minority educational researchers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The coordination of the mission of the Office with that of other components of the Department of Education is critical. The Office should improve the coordination of the educational research, development, and dissemination function with those of other Federal agencies.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] was established with the commitment of forty percent Federal funding but currently receives only eight percent Federal funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this funding shortfall is particularly burdensome to school districts and schools in low-income areas which serve higher than average proportions of students with disabilities and have fewer local resources to contribute; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it would cost the Federal Government approximately $10,000,000,000 each year to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Government should provide States and communities with adequate resources under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] as soon as reasonably possible, through the reallocation of noneducation funds within the current budget monetary constraints.</p>

Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of any civil penalty under this section, the total amount shall not exceed the amount of Federal funds received by such person for the fiscal year in which the continuing violations occurred. For the purpose of the prohibition in subsection (c) of this section, the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall mean the head of the applicable Federal agency or the contractor of such agency providing the services to children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Administrative proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A civil penalty may be assessed in a written notice, or an administrative compliance order may be issued, by the Secretary only after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5. Before making such assessment or issuing such order, or both, the Secretary shall give written notice thereof to such person by certified mail with return receipt and provide therein an opportunity to request in writing not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice such hearing. The notice shall reasonably describe the violation and be accompanied with the procedures for such hearing and a simple form to request such hearing if such person desires to use such form. If a hearing is requested, the Secretary shall establish by such certified notice the time and place for such hearing which should be located, to the greatest extent possible, at a location convenient to such person. The Secretary (or the Secretary's designee) and such person may consult to arrange a suitable date and location where appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Circumstances affecting penalty or order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of the civil penalty or the nature of the administrative compliance order, the Secretary shall take into account, as appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to the violator, any good faith efforts to comply, the importance of achieving early and permanent compliance, the ability to pay or comply, the effect of the penalty or order on the ability to continue operation, any prior history of the same kind of violation, the degree of culpability, and any demonstration of willingness to comply with the prohibitions of this section in a timely manner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Modification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may, as appropriate, compromise, modify, or remit, with or without <!-- PDFPage:1184 -->conditions, any civil penalty or administrative compliance order. In the case of a civil penalty, the amount, as finally determined by the Secretary or agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums that the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities owes to the person against whom the penalty is assessed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Petition for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person aggrieved by a penalty assessed or an order issued, or both, by the Secretary under this section may file a petition for judicial review thereof with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which the person resides or transacts business. Such person shall provide a copy thereof to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. The petition shall be filed within 30 days after the Secretary's assessment or order, or both, are final and have been provided to such person by certified mail. The Secretary shall promptly provide to the court a certified copy of the transcript of any hearing held under this section and a copy of the notice or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty or comply with an order, after either or both are final under this section, or after a court under paragraph (5) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Attorney General, at the request of the Secretary, shall recover the amount of the civil penalty (plus interest at then currently prevailing rates from the day either or both are final) or enforce the order in an action brought in the appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the penalty or order or the amount of the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
