<p class="statutory-body">No accrediting agency or association may be determined by the Secretary to be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered for the purposes of this chapter or for other Federal purposes, unless the agency or association meets standards established by the Secretary pursuant to this section. The Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, establish standards for such determinations. Such standards shall include an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement. Such standards shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the accrediting agency or association shall be a State, regional, or national agency or association and shall demonstrate the ability and the experience to operate as an accrediting agency or association within the State, region, or nationally, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such agency or association&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) for the purpose of participation in programs under this chapter, has a voluntary membership of institutions of higher education and has as a principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher education; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such agency or association consistently applies and enforces standards that ensure that the courses or programs of instruction, training, or study at the institution of higher education are of sufficient quality to achieve, for the duration of the accreditation period, the stated objective for which the courses or the programs are offered;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Operating procedures required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No accrediting agency or association may be approved by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered by an institution seeking to participate in the programs authorized under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, unless the agency or association&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) performs, at regularly established intervals, on-site inspections and reviews of institutions of higher education (at least one of which inspections at each institution that provides vocational education and training shall be unannounced), with particular focus on educational quality and program effectiveness, and ensures that accreditation team members are well-trained and knowledgeable with respect to their responsibilities;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Initial arbitration rule</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action brought by an institution of higher education seeking accreditation from, or accredited by, an accrediting agency or association approved by the Secretary for the purpose of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and involving the denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation of the institution of higher education, shall be brought in the appropriate United States district court.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Change of accrediting agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is in the process of changing its accrediting agency or association, unless the eligible institution submits to the Secretary all materials relating to the prior accreditation, including materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing the accrediting agency or association.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Dual accreditation rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is accredited, as an institution, by <!-- PDFPage:459 -->more than one accrediting agency or association, unless the institution submits to each such agency and association and to the Secretary the reasons for accreditation by more than one such agency or association and demonstrates to the Secretary reasonable cause for its accreditation by more than one agency or association.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Impact of loss of accreditation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An institution may not be certified or recertified as an institution of higher education under section 1088 of this title and subpart 3 of this part or participate in any of the other programs authorized by this chapter if such institution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not currently accredited by any agency or association recognized by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated for cause during the preceding 24 months, unless such withdrawal, revocation, or termination has been rescinded by the same accrediting agency; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is related to the religious mission or affiliation of the institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not related to the accreditation standards provided for in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Limitation, suspension or termination of approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall limit, suspend, or terminate the approval of an accrediting agency or association if the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the accrediting agency or association has failed to apply effectively the standards or operate according to the procedures provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may determine that an accrediting agency or association has failed to apply effectively the standards provided in this section if an institution of higher education seeks and receives accreditation from the accrediting agency or association during any period in which the institution is the subject of any interim action by another accrediting agency or association, described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (2)(B), or (2)(C) of subsection (a) of this section, leading to the suspension, revocation, or termination of accreditation or the institution has been notified of the threatened loss of accreditation, and the due process procedures required by such suspension, revocation, termination, or threatened loss have not been completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Limitation on Secretary's authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may only recognize accrediting agencies or associations which accredit institutions of higher education for the purpose of enabling such institutions to establish eligibility to participate in the programs under this chapter or which accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling them to establish eligibility to participate in other programs administered by the Department of Education or other Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Independent evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of the performance of all accrediting agencies or associations which seek recognition by the Secretary in order to determine whether such accrediting agencies or associations meet the standards established by this section. The Secretary shall conduct an independent evaluation of the information provided by such agency or association. Such evaluation shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the solicitation of third-party information concerning the performance of the accrediting agency or association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) site visits, including unannounced site visits as appropriate, at accrediting agencies and associations, and, at the Secretary's discretion, at representative member institutions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall place a priority for review of accrediting agencies or associations on those agencies or associations that accredit institutions of higher education that participate most extensively in the programs authorized by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and on those agencies or associations which have been the subject of the most complaints or legal actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall consider all available relevant information concerning the compliance of the accrediting agency or association with the standards provided for in this section, including any complaints or legal actions against such agency or association. In cases where deficiencies in the performance of an accreditation agency or association with respect to the requirements of this section are noted, the Secretary shall take these deficiencies into account in the approval process. The Secretary shall not, under any circumstances, base decisions on the approval or disapproval of accreditation agencies or associations on standards other than those contained in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall maintain sufficient documentation to support the conclusions reached in the approval process, and, upon disapproval of any accreditation agency or association, shall make publicly available the reason for such disapproval, including reference to the specific standards under this section which have not been fulfilled.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:460 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Regulations</h4>
