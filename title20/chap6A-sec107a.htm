<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Through the Commissioner, make annual surveys of concession vending opportunities for blind persons on Federal and other property in the United States, particularly with respect to Federal property under the control of the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Make surveys throughout the United States of industries with a view to obtaining information that will assist blind persons to obtain employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Make available to the public, and especially to persons and organizations engaged in <!-- PDFPage:65 -->work for the blind, information obtained as a result of such surveys;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Designate as provided in section 107b of this title the State agency for the blind in each State, or, in any State in which there is no such agency, some other public agency to issue licenses to blind persons who are citizens of the United States for the operating of vending facilities on Federal and other property in such State for the vending of newspapers, periodicals, confections, tobacco products, foods, beverages, and other articles or services dispensed automatically or manually and prepared on or off the premises in accordance with all applicable health laws, as determined by the State licensing agency, and including the vending or exchange of chances for any lottery authorized by State law and conducted by an agency of a State; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Duty of State licensing agencies to prefer blind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State licensing agency shall, in issuing each such license for the operation of a vending facility, give preference to blind persons who are in need of employment. Each such license shall be issued for an indefinite period but may be terminated by the State licensing agency if it is satisfied that the facility is not being operated in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by such licensing agency. Such licenses shall be issued only to applicants who are blind within the meaning of section 107e of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Selection of location and type of facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State licensing agency designated by the Secretary is authorized, with the approval of the head of the department or agency in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of the Federal property on which the facility is to be located but subject to regulations prescribed pursuant to section 107 of this title, to select a location for such facility and the type of facility to be provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Buildings occupied by United States departments, agencies, and instrumentalities required to provide sites for facilities; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After January 1, 1975, no department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States shall undertake to acquire by ownership, rent, lease, or to otherwise occupy, in whole or in part, any building unless, after consultation with the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality and the State licensing agency, it is determined by the Secretary that (A) such building includes a satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind person, or (B) if a building is to be constructed, substantially altered, or renovated, or in the case of a building that is already occupied on such date by such department, agency, or instrumentality, is to be substantially altered or renovated for use by such department, agency, or instrumentality, the design for such construction, substantial alteration, or renovation includes a satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind person. Each such department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide notice to the appropriate State licensing agency of its plans for occupation, acquisition, renovation, or relocation of a building adequate to permit such State agency to determine whether such building includes a satisfactory site or sites for a vending facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply (A) when the Secretary and the State licensing agency determine that the number of people using the property is or will be insufficient to support a vending facility, or (B) to any privately owned building, any part of which is leased by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States and in which, (i) prior to the execution of such lease, the lessor or any of his tenants had in operation a restaurant or other food facility in a part of the building not included in such lease, and (ii) the operation of such a vending facility by a blind person would be in proximate and substantial direct competition with such restaurant or other food facility except that each such department, agency, and instrumentality shall make every effort to lease property in privately owned buildings capable of accommodating a vending facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;satisfactory site&rdquo; means an area determined by the Secretary to have sufficient space, electrical and plumbing outlets, and such other facilities as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State licensing agency in States having vocational rehabilitation plans</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">The content of Pub. L. 93&ndash;516, including provisions of section 203 thereof which amended this section, were originally contained in H.R. 14225, 93rd Congress, Second Session, which was pocket-vetoed during the 31-day intrasession adjournment of the 93rd Congress for the Congressional elections in November, 1974. See 1974 Amendment note below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (<em>Kennedy v. Jones</em>, D.C.D.C. 1976, 412 F.Supp. 353) H.R. 1422 was deemed to have become law without the approval of the President on Nov. 21, 1974, and was given the designation Pub. L. 93&ndash;651. Therefore, for purposes of codification, this section should be deemed to have been amended by Pub. L. 93&ndash;651, title II, &sect;203, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2&ndash;8, 2&ndash;9, in exactly the same manner as it was amended by Pub. L. 93&ndash;516, Dec. 7, 1974, 88 Stat. 1617.</p>
