<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) all students can learn and achieve to high standards and must realize their potential if the United States is to prosper;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the reforms in education from 1977 through 1992 have achieved some good results, but such reform efforts often have been limited to a few schools or to a single part of the educational system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) leadership must come from teachers, related services personnel, principals, and parents in individual schools, and from policymakers at the local, State, tribal, and national levels, in order for lasting improvements in student performance to occur;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) simultaneous top-down and bottom-up education reform is necessary to spur creative and innovative approaches by individual schools to help all students achieve internationally competitive standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) strategies must be developed by communities and States to support the revitalization of all local public schools by fundamentally changing the entire system of public education through comprehensive, coherent, and coordinated improvement in order to increase student learning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) parents, teachers, and other local educators, and business, community, and tribal leaders must be involved in developing systemwide improvement strategies that reflect the needs of their individual communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) State and local education improvement efforts must incorporate strategies for providing all students and families with coordinated access to appropriate social services, health care, nutrition, and early childhood education, and child care to remove preventable barriers to learning and enhance school readiness for all students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) States and local educational agencies, working together, must immediately set about developing and implementing such systemwide improvement strategies if our Nation is to educate all children to meet their full potential and achieve the National Education Goals described in subchapter I of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) State and local systemic improvement strategies must provide all students with effective mechanisms and appropriate paths to the work force as well as to higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) businesses should be encouraged&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to enter into partnerships with schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide information and guidance to schools based on the needs of area businesses for properly educated graduates in general and on the need for particular workplace skills that the schools may provide;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to provide necessary education and training materials and support; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to continue the lifelong learning process throughout the employment years of an individual;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) schools should provide information to businesses regarding how the business community can assist schools in meeting the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) institutions of higher education should be encouraged to enter into partnerships with schools to provide information and guidance to schools on the skills and knowledge graduates need in order to enter and successfully complete postsecondary education, and schools should provide information and guidance to institutions of higher education on the skills, knowledge, and preservice training teachers need, and the types of professional development educators need in order to meet the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) the appropriate and innovative use of technology, including distance learning, can be very effective in helping to provide all students with the opportunity to learn and meet high standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Federal funds should be targeted to support State and local initiatives, and to leverage State and local resources for designing and implementing systemwide education improvement plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) all students are entitled to participate in a broad and challenging curriculum and to have access to resources sufficient to address other education needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) quality education management services are being utilized by local educational agencies and schools through contractual agreements among local educational agencies or schools and businesses providing quality education management services.</p>
