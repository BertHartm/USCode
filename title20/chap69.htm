<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) three-fourths of high school students in the United States enter the workforce without baccalaureate degrees, and many do not possess the academic and entry-level occupational skills necessary to succeed in the changing United States workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a substantial number of youths in the United States, especially disadvantaged students, students of diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds, and students with disabilities, do not complete high school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) unemployment among youths in the United States is intolerably high, and earnings of high school graduates have been falling relative to earnings of individuals with more education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the workplace in the United States is changing in response to heightened international competition and new technologies, and such forces, which are ultimately beneficial to the Nation, are shrinking the demand for and undermining the earning power of unskilled labor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the United States lacks a comprehensive and coherent system to help its youths acquire the knowledge, skills, abilities, and information about and access to the labor market necessary to make an effective transition from school to career-oriented work or to further education and training;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) students in the United States can achieve high academic and occupational standards, and many learn better and retain more when the students learn in context, rather than in the abstract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) while many students in the United States have part-time jobs, there is infrequent linkage between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such jobs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the career planning or exploration, or the school-based learning, of such students;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the work-based learning approach, which is modeled after the time-honored apprenticeship concept, integrates theoretical instruction with structured on-the-job training, and this approach, combined with school-based learning, can be very effective in engaging student interest, enhancing skill acquisition, developing positive work attitudes, and preparing youths for high-skill, high-wage careers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Federal resources currently fund a series of categorical, work-related education and training programs, many of which serve disadvantaged youths, that are not administered as a coherent whole; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) in 1992 approximately 3,400,000 individuals in the United States age 16 through 24 had not completed high school and were not currently enrolled in school, a number representing approximately 11 percent of all individuals in this age group, which indicates that these young persons are particularly unprepared for the demands of a 21st century workforce.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are a part of comprehensive education reform;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are integrated with the systems developed under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.] and the National Skill Standards Act of 1994 [20 U.S.C. 5931 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) offer opportunities for all students to participate in a performance-based education and training program that will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) enable the students to earn portable credentials;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prepare the students for first jobs in high-skill, high-wage careers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) increase their opportunities for further education, including education in a 4-year college or university;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to facilitate the creation of a universal, high-quality school-to-work transition system that enables youths in the United States to identify and navigate paths to productive and progressively more rewarding roles in the workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to utilize workplaces as active learning environments in the educational process by making employers joint partners with educators in providing opportunities for all students to participate in high-quality, work-based learning experiences;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to use Federal funds under this chapter as venture capital, to underwrite the initial costs of planning and establishing statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems that will be maintained with other Federal, State, and local resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to promote the formation of local partnerships that are dedicated to linking the worlds of school and work among secondary schools and postsecondary educational institutions, private and public employers, labor organizations, government, community-based organizations, parents, students, State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and training and human service agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to promote the formation of local partnerships between elementary schools and secondary schools (including middle schools) and local businesses as an investment in future workplace productivity and competitiveness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to help all students attain high academic and occupational standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to build on and advance a range of promising school-to-work activities, such as tech-prep education, career academies, school-to-apprenticeship programs, cooperative education, youth apprenticeship, school-sponsored enterprises, business-education compacts, and promising strategies that assist school dropouts, that can be developed into programs funded under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) to improve the knowledge and skills of youths by integrating academic and occupational learning, integrating school-based and work-based learning, and building effective linkages between secondary and postsecondary education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) to encourage the development and implementation of programs that will require paid high-quality, work-based learning experiences;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) to motivate all youths, including low-achieving youths, school dropouts, and youths with disabilities, to stay in or return to school or a classroom setting and strive to succeed, by providing enriched learning experiences and assistance in obtaining good jobs and continuing their education in postsecondary educational institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) to expose students to a broad array of career opportunities, and facilitate the selection of career majors, based on individual interests, goals, strengths, and abilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) to increase opportunities for minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities, by enabling individuals to prepare for careers that are not traditional for their race, gender, or disability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) to further the National Education Goals set forth in title I of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5811 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional intent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intent of Congress that the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education jointly administer this chapter in a flexible manner that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promotes State and local discretion in establishing and implementing statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems and School-to-Work Opportunities programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contributes to reinventing government by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) building on State and local capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) eliminating duplication in education and training programs for youths by integrating such programs into 1 comprehensive system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) maximizing the effective use of resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) supporting locally established initiatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) requiring measurable goals for performance; and</p>
