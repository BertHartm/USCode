<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each prescribe regulations relating to the availability of financial assistance under subparagraph (A).

The dependent may be required to satisfy other eligibility requirements and comply with standards of conduct applicable to students actually enrolled in that school who use or receive the same auxiliary services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;auxiliary services&rdquo; includes use of academic resources, access to the library of the school, after hours use of school facilities, and participation in music, sports, and other extracurricular and interscholastic activities.</p>
