<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $5,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this part in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) was a first-time participant in the program in fiscal year 2000 or any subsequent fiscal year, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Default penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Years preceding fiscal year 2000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year preceding fiscal year 2000, any institution with a cohort default rate that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) equals or exceeds 15 percent, shall establish a default reduction plan pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, except that such plan shall not be required with respect to an institution that has a default rate of less than 20 percent and that has less than 100 students who have loans under this part in such academic year;</p>

The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal within 45 days after the submission of the appeal. Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the calculation of the institution's cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce the institution's cohort default rate for any of the 3 fiscal years below 50 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, such a small number of borrowers entering repayment that the application of this subparagraph would be inequitable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount which bears the same ratio to such balance (as of the date of such distribution) as the total amount of Federal capital contributions to such fund by the Secretary under this part bears to the sum of such Federal capital contributions and the capital contributions to such fund made by the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The remainder of such student loan fund shall be paid to the institution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Use of returned funds</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;loss of eligibility&rdquo; shall be defined as the mandatory liquidation of an institution's student loan fund, and assignment of the institution's outstanding loan portfolio to the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Cohort default rate&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The term &ldquo;cohort default rate&rdquo; means, for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter repayment on loans under this part (received for attendance at the institution), the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment on such loans (received for attendance at that institution) in that award year who default before the end of the following award year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For any award year in which less than 30 of the institution's current and former students enter repayment, the term &ldquo;cohort default rate&rdquo; means the percentage of such current and former students who entered repayment on such loans in any of the three most recent award years and who default before the end of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with such institution, in <!-- PDFPage:432 -->order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in default for the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student (and his or her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to the school for attendance at which the student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) In determining the number of students who default before the end of such award year, the institution, in calculating the cohort default rate, shall exclude&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded, because of that discharge, from receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 for which the borrower would be otherwise eligible (but for the default on the discharged loan).
