<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] was established with the commitment of forty percent Federal funding but currently receives only eight percent Federal funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this funding shortfall is particularly burdensome to school districts and schools in low-income areas which serve higher than average proportions of students with disabilities and have fewer local resources to contribute; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it would cost the Federal Government approximately $10,000,000,000 each year to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Government should provide States and communities with adequate resources under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] as soon as reasonably possible, through the reallocation of noneducation funds within the current budget monetary constraints.</p>
