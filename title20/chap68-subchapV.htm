<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish a National Skill Standards Board to serve as a catalyst in stimulating the development and adoption of a voluntary national system of skill standards and of assessment and certification of attainment of skill standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that will serve as a cornerstone of the national strategy to enhance workforce skills;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1038 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that will result in increased productivity, economic growth, and American economic competitiveness; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that can be used, consistent with civil rights laws&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by the Nation, to ensure the development of a high skills, high quality, high performance workforce, including the most skilled frontline workforce in the world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by industries, as a vehicle for informing training providers and prospective employees of skills necessary for employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by employers, to assist in evaluating the skill levels of prospective employees and to assist in the training of current employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) by labor organizations, to enhance the employment security of workers by providing portable credentials and skills;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) by workers, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) obtain certifications of their skills to protect against dislocation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) enhance their ability to reenter the workforce;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) by students and entry level workers, to determine the skill levels and competencies needed to be obtained in order to compete effectively for high wage jobs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) by training providers and educators, to determine appropriate training services to offer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) by government, to evaluate whether publicly funded training assists participants to meet skill standards where such standards exist and thereby protect the integrity of public expenditures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) to facilitate the transition to high performance work organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) to increase opportunities for minorities and women, including removing barriers to the entry of women into nontraditional employment; and</p>
