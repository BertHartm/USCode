<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Reaching the National Education Goals, particularly the third, fourth, and fifth National Education Goals, requires a comprehensive educational reform strategy that involves parents, schools, government, communities, and other public and private organizations at all levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A crucial component of the strategy for achieving such goals is ensuring, through sustained and intensive high-quality professional development, that all teachers will provide challenging learning experiences in the core academic subjects for their students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Decisionmaking as to what activities a State or local educational agency should undertake to improve teaching and learning are best made by individuals in the schools closest to the classroom and most knowledgeable about the needs of schools and students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The potential positive impact of high-quality professional development is underscored by recent research findings that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) professional development must be focused on teaching and learning in order to improve the opportunities of all students to achieve higher standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) effective professional development focuses on discipline-based knowledge and effective subject-specific pedagogical skills, involves teams of teachers, and, where appropriate, administrators and pupil services personnel, in a school and, through professional networks of teachers, and, where appropriate, teacher educators, administrators, pupil services personnel, and parents, is interactive and collaborative, motivates by its intrinsic content and relationship to practice, builds on experience and learning-by-doing, and becomes incorporated into the everyday life of the school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) professional development can dramatically improve classroom instruction and learning when teachers, and, where appropriate, administrators, pupil services personnel, and parents, are partners in the development and implementation of such professional development; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) new and innovative strategies for teaching to high standards will require time for teachers, outside of the time spent teaching, for instruction, practice, and collegial collaboration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Special attention must be given in professional development activities to ensure that education professionals are knowledgeable of, and make use of, strategies for serving populations that historically have lacked access to equal opportunities for advanced learning and career advancement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Professional development is often a victim of budget reductions in fiscally difficult times.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The Federal Government has a vital role in helping States and local educational agencies to make sustained and intensive high-quality professional development in the core academic subjects become an integral part of the elementary and secondary education system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Professional development activities must prepare teachers, pupil services personnel, paraprofessionals and other staff in the collaborative skills needed to appropriately teach children with disabilities, in the core academic subjects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Parental involvement is an important aspect of school reform and improvement. There is a need for special attention to ensure the effective involvement of parents in the education of their children. Professional development should include methods and strategies to better prepare teachers and, where appropriate, administrators, to enable parents to participate fully and effectively in their children's education.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) teachers must be major players in educational reform in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) teachers are isolated from their peers and have virtually no time during the school day to consult with other teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) there is a shortage of sustained, year-round professional development programs for teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) successful teaching methods are not adequately shared among teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) teachers are the best teachers of other teachers because practicing classroom teachers have experience that no outside consultant can match;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) it is important for universities and schools to collaborate on teacher development programs if teaching and learning are to be improved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) pertinent research is not shared among teachers in a professional setting;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) exemplary teachers should be recognized for their abilities and contributions and encouraged to refine their teaching methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) each State should support a nationally based teacher training program, that is modeled after the National Writing Project, for teachers of early childhood education, and for teachers of core academic subjects including teachers of mathematics, science, English, civics and government, foreign languages, and arts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) the National Writing Project is a nationally recognized and honored nonprofit organization that recognizes there are teachers in every region of the United States who have developed successful methods for teaching writing and that such teachers can be trained and encouraged to train other teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) the National Writing Project is a collaborative university-school program which offers summer and school year inservice teacher training programs and a dissemination network to inform and teach teachers regarding developments in the field of writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) each year, over 125,000 teachers voluntarily seek training in National Writing Project intensive summer institutes and workshops and school year inservice programs through one of the 155 sites located within the United States, and in 18 sites located outside of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(M) in the 20 years of its existence, over 1,100,000 teachers, administrators, and parents have participated in National Writing Project programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(N) less than $16 per teacher was the average cost in Federal dollars for all teacher training at writing projects in academic year 1991&ndash;1992;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(O) for every dollar in Federal support, the National Writing Project provides over $5 in matching funds from States, local universities and schools, and the private sector;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(P) private foundation resources, although generous in the past concerning National Writing Project programs, are inadequate to fund all of the National Teacher Training Project sites needed, and the future of the program is in jeopardy without secure financial support;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) underlying the standards-driven framework of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.] and the high academic standards for eligible students under subchapter I of this chapter is a widespread need to prepare teachers to teach to higher standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prospective and current teachers need knowledge and skills beyond what such teachers currently possess;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) while both the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.] and subchapters I and II of this chapter have extensive references to professional development of teachers, there are no provisions to incorporate &ldquo;on-the-ground&rdquo; planning and implementation to serve as models for local educational agencies across the Nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) better prepared teachers can lead to improved student achievement, especially for students who are furthest from reaching high standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to address the need for professional development with a primary focus on teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide both prospective teachers and current teachers opportunities to learn both the content and the pedagogy needed to teach to high standards; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1190 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to build models, in a few cities and States, that demonstrate new organizational arrangements and deep investments in teachers necessary to better prepare teachers for new standards and assessments.</p>
