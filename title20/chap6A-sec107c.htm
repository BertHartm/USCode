<p class="note-body">Section, act June 20, 1936, ch. 638, &sect;4, 49 Stat. 1560; Reorg. Plan No. 2 of 1946, &sect;6, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7873, 60 Stat. 1095; Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1953, &sect;&sect;5, 8 eff. Apr. 11, 1953, 18 F.R. 2053, 67 Stat. 631, related to provisions authorizing the Secretary to cooperate with State boards for rehabilitation of handicapped persons, established by the several States pursuant to sections 31 to 42b of Title 29, Labor, as amended and supplemented, in carrying out the provisions of this chapter. See section 701 et seq. of Title 29.</p>
<p class="note-body">The content of Pub. L. 93&ndash;516, including provisions of section 205 thereof which repealed this section, were originally contained in H.R. 14225, 93rd Congress, Second Session, which was pocket-vetoed during the 31-day intrasession adjournment of the 93rd Congress for the Congressional elections in November, 1974.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (<em>Kennedy v. Jones</em>, D.C.D.C. 1976, 412 F.Supp. 353) H.R. 14225 was deemed to have become law without the approval of the President on Nov. 21, 1974, and was given the designation Pub. L. 93&ndash;651. Therefore, for purposes of codification, this section should be deemed to have been repealed by Pub. L. 93&ndash;651, title II, &sect;205, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2&ndash;11, in exactly the same manner as it was repealed by Pub. L. 93&ndash;516.</p>
