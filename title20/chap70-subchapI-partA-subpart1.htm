<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State plan submitted under paragraph (1) may be submitted as part of a consolidated plan under section 7842 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Academic standards, academic assessments, and accountability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Challenging academic standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State has adopted challenging academic content standards and challenging student academic achievement standards that will be used by the State, its local educational agencies, and its schools to carry out this part, except that a State shall not be required to submit such standards to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Same standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The academic standards required by subparagraph (A) shall be the same academic standards that the State applies to all schools and children in the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Subjects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State shall have such academic standards for all public elementary school and secondary school children, including children served under this part, in subjects determined by the State, but including at least mathematics, reading or language arts, and (beginning in the 2005&ndash;2006 school year) science, which shall include the same knowledge, skills, and levels of achievement expected of all children.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Challenging academic standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Standards under this paragraph shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) challenging academic content standards in academic subjects that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) specify what children are expected to know and be able to do;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) contain coherent and rigorous content; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) encourage the teaching of advanced skills; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) challenging student academic achievement standards that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the subjects in which students will be served under this part, but for which a State is not required by subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to develop, and has not otherwise developed, such academic standards, the State plan shall describe a strategy for ensuring that students are taught the same knowledge and skills in such subjects and held to the same expectations as are all children.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Existing standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this part shall prohibit a State from revising, consistent with this section, <!-- PDFPage:1017 -->any standard adopted under this part before or after January 8, 2002.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Accountability</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State has developed and is implementing a single, statewide State accountability system that will be effective in ensuring that all local educational agencies, public elementary schools, and public secondary schools make adequate yearly progress as defined under this paragraph. Each State accountability system shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) be based on the academic standards and academic assessments adopted under paragraphs (1) and (3), and other academic indicators consistent with subparagraph (C)(vi) and (vii), and shall take into account the achievement of all public elementary school and secondary school students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) be the same accountability system the State uses for all public elementary schools and secondary schools or all local educational agencies in the State, except that public elementary schools, secondary schools, and local educational agencies not participating under this part are not subject to the requirements of section 6316 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) include sanctions and rewards, such as bonuses and recognition, the State will use to hold local educational agencies and public elementary schools and secondary schools accountable for student achievement and for ensuring that they make adequate yearly progress in accordance with the State's definition under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adequate yearly progress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State plan shall demonstrate, based on academic assessments described in paragraph (3), and in accordance with this paragraph, what constitutes adequate yearly progress of the State, and of all public elementary schools, secondary schools, and local educational agencies in the State, toward enabling all public elementary school and secondary school students to meet the State's student academic achievement standards, while working toward the goal of narrowing the achievement gaps in the State, local educational agencies, and schools.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&ldquo;Adequate yearly progress&rdquo; shall be defined by the State in a manner that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) applies the same high standards of academic achievement to all public elementary school and secondary school students in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is statistically valid and reliable;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-4em">except that disaggregation of data under subclause (II) shall not be required in a case in which the number of students in a category is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) in accordance with subparagraph (D), includes graduation rates for public secondary school students (defined as the percentage of students who graduate from secondary school with a regular diploma in the standard number of years) and at least one other academic indicator, as determined by the State for all public elementary school students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) in accordance with subparagraph (D), at the State's discretion, may also include other academic indicators, as determined by the State for all public school students, measured separately for each group described in clause (v), such as achievement on additional State or locally administered assessments, decreases in grade-to-grade retention rates, attendance rates, and changes in the percentages of students completing gifted and talented, advanced placement, and college preparatory courses.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Requirements for other indicators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In carrying out subparagraph (C)(vi) and (vii), the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall ensure that the indicators described in those provisions are valid and reliable, and are consistent with relevant, nationally recognized professional and technical standards, if any; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (I)(i), may not use those indicators to reduce the number of, or change, the schools that would otherwise be subject to school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under section 6316 of this title if those additional indicators were not used, but may use them to identify additional schools for school improvement or in need of corrective action or restructuring.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Starting point</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State, using data for the 2001&ndash;2002 school year, shall establish the starting point for measuring, under subparagraphs (G) and (H), the percentage of students meeting or exceeding the State's proficient level <!-- PDFPage:1018 -->of academic achievement on the State assessments under paragraph (3) and pursuant to the timeline described in subparagraph (F). The starting point shall be, at a minimum, based on the higher of the percentage of students at the proficient level who are in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the State's lowest achieving group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v)(II); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the school at the 20th percentile in the State, based on enrollment, among all schools ranked by the percentage of students at the proficient level.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Timeline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall establish a timeline for adequate yearly progress. The timeline shall ensure that not later than 12 years after the end of the 2001&ndash;2002 school year, all students in each group described in subparagraph (C)(v) will meet or exceed the State's proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Measurable objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall establish statewide annual measurable objectives, pursuant to subparagraph (C)(v), for meeting the requirements of this paragraph, and which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be set separately for the assessments of mathematics and reading or language arts under subsection (a)(3) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be the same for all schools and local educational agencies in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall identify a single minimum percentage of students who are required to meet or exceed the proficient level on the academic assessments that applies separately to each group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) shall ensure that all students will meet or exceed the State's proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments within the State's timeline under subparagraph (F); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) may be the same for more than 1 year, subject to the requirements of subparagraph (H).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Intermediate goals for annual yearly progress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall establish intermediate goals for meeting the requirements, including the measurable objectives in subparagraph (G), of this paragraph and that shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide for the first increase to occur in not more than 2 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) provide for each following increase to occur in not more than 3 years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(I) Annual improvement for schools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each year, for a school to make adequate yearly progress under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) each group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v) must meet or exceed the objectives set by the State under subparagraph (G), except that if any group described in subparagraph (C)(v) does not meet those objectives in any particular year, the school shall be considered to have made adequate yearly progress if the percentage of students in that group who did not meet or exceed the proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments under paragraph (3) for that year decreased by 10 percent of that percentage from the preceding school year and that group made progress on one or more of the academic indicators described in subparagraph (C)(vi) or (vii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not less than 95 percent of each group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v) who are enrolled in the school are required to take the assessments, consistent with paragraph (3)(C)(xi) and with accommodations, guidelines, and alternative assessments provided in the same manner as those provided under section 612(a)(17)(A) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(17)(A)] and paragraph (3), on which adequate yearly progress is based (except that the 95 percent requirement described in this clause shall not apply in a case in which the number of students in a category is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(J) Uniform averaging procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of determining whether schools are making adequate yearly progress, the State may establish a uniform procedure for averaging data which includes one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The State may average data from the school year for which the determination is made with data from one or two school years immediately preceding that school year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Until the assessments described in paragraph (3) are administered in such manner and time to allow for the implementation of the uniform procedure for averaging data described in clause (i), the State may use the academic assessments that were required under paragraph (3) as that paragraph was in effect on the day preceding January 8, 2002, provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed to undermine or delay the determination of adequate yearly progress, the requirements of section 6316 of this title, or the implementation of assessments under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The State may use data across grades in a school.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(K) Accountability for charter schools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The accountability provisions under this chapter shall be overseen for charter schools in accordance with State charter school law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Academic assessments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State educational agency, in consultation with local educational agencies, has im<!-- PDFPage:1019 -->plemented a set of high-quality, yearly student academic assessments that include, at a minimum, academic assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and science that will be used as the primary means of determining the yearly performance of the State and of each local educational agency and school in the State in enabling all children to meet the State's challenging student academic achievement standards, except that no State shall be required to meet the requirements of this part relating to science assessments until the beginning of the 2007&ndash;2008 school year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State educational agency may incorporate the data from the assessments under this paragraph into a State-developed longitudinal data system that links student test scores, length of enrollment, and graduation records over time.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such assessments shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) be the same academic assessments used to measure the achievement of all children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) be aligned with the State's challenging academic content and student academic achievement standards, and provide coherent information about student attainment of such standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) be used for purposes for which such assessments are valid and reliable, and be consistent with relevant, nationally recognized professional and technical standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) be used only if the State educational agency provides to the Secretary evidence from the test publisher or other relevant sources that the assessments used are of adequate technical quality for each purpose required under this chapter and are consistent with the requirements of this section, and such evidence is made public by the Secretary upon request;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v)(I) except as otherwise provided for grades 3 through 8 under clause vii, measure the proficiency of students in, at a minimum, mathematics and reading or language arts, and be administered not less than once during&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(cc) grades 10 through 12;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) beginning not later than school year 2007&ndash;2008, measure the proficiency of all students in science and be administered not less than one time during&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) grades 3 through 5;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) grades 6 through 9; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(cc) grades 10 through 12;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) involve multiple up-to-date measures of student academic achievement, including measures that assess higher-order thinking skills and understanding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) beginning not later than school year 2005&ndash;2006, measure the achievement of students against the challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards in each of grades 3 through 8 in, at a minimum, mathematics, and reading or language arts, except that the Secretary may provide the State 1 additional year if the State demonstrates that exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State, prevented full implementation of the academic assessments by that deadline and that the State will complete implementation within the additional 1-year period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) at the discretion of the State, measure the proficiency of students in academic subjects not described in clauses (v), (vi), (vii) in which the State has adopted challenging academic content and academic achievement standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participation in such assessments of all students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the reasonable adaptations and accommodations for students with disabilities (as defined under section 602(3) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1401(3)]) necessary to measure the academic achievement of such students relative to State academic content and State student academic achievement standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the inclusion of limited English proficient students, who shall be assessed in a valid and reliable manner and provided reasonable accommodations on assessments administered to such students under this paragraph, including, to the extent practicable, assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate data on what such students know and can do in academic content areas, until such students have achieved English language proficiency as determined under paragraph (7);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(x) notwithstanding subclause (III), the academic assessment (using tests written in English) of reading or language arts of any student who has attended school in the United States (not including Puerto Rico) for three or more consecutive school years, except that if the local educational agency determines, on a case-by-case individual basis, that academic assessments in another language or form would likely yield more accurate and reliable information on what such student knows and can do, the local educational agency may make a determination to assess such student in the appropriate language other than English for a period that does not exceed two additional consecutive years, provided that such student has not yet reached a level of English language proficiency sufficient to yield valid and reliable information on what such student knows and can do on tests (written in English) of reading or language arts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xi) include students who have attended schools in a local educational agency for a full academic year but have not attended a single school for a full academic year, except that the performance of students who <!-- PDFPage:1020 -->have attended more than 1 school in the local educational agency in any academic year shall be used only in determining the progress of the local educational agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xii) produce individual student interpretive, descriptive, and diagnostic reports, consistent with clause (iii) that allow parents, teachers, and principals to understand and address the specific academic needs of students, and include information regarding achievement on academic assessments aligned with State academic achievement standards, and that are provided to parents, teachers, and principals, as soon as is practicably possible after the assessment is given, in an understandable and uniform format, and to the extent practicable, in a language that parents can understand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xiii) enable results to be disaggregated within each State, local educational agency, and school by gender, by each major racial and ethnic group, by English proficiency status, by migrant status, by students with disabilities as compared to nondisabled students, and by economically disadvantaged students as compared to students who are not economically disadvantaged, except that, in the case of a local educational agency or a school, such disaggregation shall not be required in a case in which the number of students in a category is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xiv) be consistent with widely accepted professional testing standards, objectively measure academic achievement, knowledge, and skills, and be tests that do not evaluate or assess personal or family beliefs and attitudes, or publicly disclose personally identifiable information; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xv) enable itemized score analyses to be produced and reported, consistent with clause (iii), to local educational agencies and schools, so that parents, teachers, principals, and administrators can interpret and address the specific academic needs of students as indicated by the students&rsquo; achievement on assessment items.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Deferral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State may defer the commencement, or suspend the administration, but not cease the development, of the assessments described in this paragraph, that were not required prior to January 8, 2002, for 1 year for each year for which the amount appropriated for grants under section 7301b(a)(2) of this title is less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) $370,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) $390,000,000 for fiscal year 2004; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) $400,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2007.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Academic assessment measures in addition to those in paragraph (3) that do not meet the requirements of such paragraph may be included in the assessment under paragraph (3) as additional measures, but may not be used in lieu of the academic assessments required under paragraph (3). Such additional assessment measures may not be used to reduce the number of or change, the schools that would otherwise be subject to school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under section 6316 of this title if such additional indicators were not used, but may be used to identify additional schools for school improvement or in need of corrective action or restructuring except as provided in paragraph (2)(I)(i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) State authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State educational agency provides evidence, which is satisfactory to the Secretary, that neither the State educational agency nor any other State government official, agency, or entity has sufficient authority, under State law, to adopt curriculum content and student academic achievement standards, and academic assessments aligned with such academic standards, which will be applicable to all students enrolled in the State's public elementary schools and secondary schools, then the State educational agency may meet the requirements of this subsection by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) adopting academic standards and academic assessments that meet the requirements of this subsection, on a statewide basis, and limiting their applicability to students served under this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adopting and implementing policies that ensure that each local educational agency in the State that receives grants under this part will adopt curriculum content and student academic achievement standards, and academic assessments aligned with such standards, which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) meet all of the criteria in this subsection and any regulations regarding such standards and assessments that the Secretary may publish; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are applicable to all students served by each such local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Language assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State plan shall identify the languages other than English that are present in the participating student population and indicate the languages for which yearly student academic assessments are not available and are needed. The State shall make every effort to develop such assessments and may request assistance from the Secretary if linguistically accessible academic assessment measures are needed. Upon request, the Secretary shall assist with the identification of appropriate academic assessment measures in the needed languages, but shall not mandate a specific academic assessment or mode of instruction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Academic assessments of English language proficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State plan shall demonstrate that local educational agencies in the State will, beginning not later than school year 2002&ndash;2003, provide for an annual assessment of English proficiency (measuring students&rsquo; oral language, reading, and writing skills in English) of all students with limited English proficiency in the schools served by the State <!-- PDFPage:1021 -->educational agency, except that the Secretary may provide the State 1 additional year if the State demonstrates that exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State, prevented full implementation of this paragraph by that deadline and that the State will complete implementation within the additional 1-year period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State plan shall describe&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall use funds received under this part only in eligible school attendance areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible school attendance areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the term &ldquo;school attendance area&rdquo; means, in relation to a particular school, the geographical area in which the children who are normally served by that school reside; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the term &ldquo;eligible school attendance area&rdquo; means a school attendance area in which the percentage of children from low-income families is at least as high as the percentage of children from low-income families served by the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Ranking order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds allocated in accordance with subsection (c) of this section are insufficient to serve all eligible school attendance areas, a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank, without regard to grade spans, such agency's eligible school attendance areas in which the concentration of children from low-income families exceeds 75 percent from highest to lowest according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Remaining funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds remain after serving all eligible school attendance areas under paragraph (3), a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank such agency's remaining eligible school attendance areas from highest to lowest either by grade span or for the entire local educational agency according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order either within each grade-span grouping or within the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agency shall use the same measure of poverty, which measure shall be the number of children ages 5 through 17 in poverty counted in the most recent census data approved by the Secretary, the number of children eligible for free and reduced priced lunches under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], the number of children in families receiving assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], or the number of children eligible to receive medical assistance under the Medicaid program, or a composite of such indicators, with respect to all school attendance areas in the local educational agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to identify eligible school attendance areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to determine the ranking of each area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to determine allocations under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to a local educational agency with a total enrollment of less than 1,000 children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver for desegregation plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a local educational agency's written request for a waiver of the requirements of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, and permit such agency to treat as eligible, and serve, any school that children attend with a State-ordered, court-ordered school desegregation plan or a plan that <!-- PDFPage:1031 -->continues to be implemented in accordance with a State-ordered or court-ordered desegregation plan, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of economically disadvantaged children enrolled in the school is at least 25 percent of the school's total enrollment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines on the basis of a written request from such agency and in accordance with such criteria as the Secretary establishes, that approval of that request would further the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Local educational agency discretion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, a local educational agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designate as eligible any school attendance area or school in which at least 35 percent of the children are from low-income families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) use funds received under this part in a school that is not in an eligible school attendance area, if the percentage of children from low-income families enrolled in the school is equal to or greater than the percentage of such children in a participating school attendance area of such agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) designate and serve a school attendance area or school that is not eligible under this section, but that was eligible and that was served in the preceding fiscal year, but only for 1 additional fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) elect not to serve an eligible school attendance area or eligible school that has a higher percentage of children from low-income families if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the school meets the comparability requirements of section 6321(c) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the school is receiving supplemental funds from other State or local sources that are spent according to the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the funds expended from such other sources equal or exceed the amount that would be provided under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(D), the number of children attending private elementary schools and secondary schools who are to receive services, and the assistance such children are to receive under this part, shall be determined without regard to whether the public school attendance area in which such children reside is assisted under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall allocate funds received under this part to eligible school attendance areas or eligible schools, identified under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, in rank order, on the basis of the total number of children from low-income families in each area or school.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the per-pupil amount of funds allocated to each school attendance area or school under paragraph (1) shall be at least 125 percent of the per-pupil amount of funds a local educational agency received for that year under the poverty criteria described by the local educational agency in the plan submitted under section 6312 of this title, except that this paragraph shall not apply to a local educational agency that only serves schools in which the percentage of such children is 35 percent or greater.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency may reduce the amount of funds allocated under subparagraph (A) for a school attendance area or school by the amount of any supplemental State and local funds expended in that school attendance area or school for programs that meet the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall reserve such funds as are necessary under this part to provide services comparable to those provided to children in schools funded under this part to serve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) homeless children who do not attend participating schools, including providing educationally related support services to children in shelters and other locations where children may live;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) children in local institutions for neglected children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if appropriate, children in local institutions for delinquent children, and neglected or delinquent children in community day school programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Financial incentives and rewards reservation</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency may consolidate and use funds under this part, together with other Federal, State, and local funds, in order to upgrade the entire educational program of a school that serves an eligible school attendance area in which not less than 40 percent of the children are from low-income families, or not less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from such families.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) how, if the agency disagrees with the views of the private school officials on the provision of services through a contract, the local educational agency will provide in writing to such private school officials an analysis of the reasons why the local educational agency has chosen not to use a contractor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such consultation shall include meetings of agency and private school officials and shall occur before the local educational agency makes any decision that affects the opportunities of eligible private school children to participate in programs under this part.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Compliance</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) using the same measure of low income used to count public school children;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1055 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Standards for a bypass</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a local educational agency is prohibited by law from providing for the participation in programs on an equitable basis of eligible children enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools, or if the Secretary determines that a local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling, to provide for such participation, as required by this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) waive the requirements of this section for such local educational agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements that shall be subject to the requirements of this section and sections 7883 and 7884 of this title; and</p>
