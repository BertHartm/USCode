Each such eligible institution or consortium shall receive an amount that bears the same relationship to the amount of funds available under such section as the number of Pell Grant recipients and recipients of assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs enrolled in programs meeting the requirements of section 2342 of this title offered by such institution or consortium in the preceding fiscal year bears to the number of such recipients enrolled in such programs within the State in such year.</p>
