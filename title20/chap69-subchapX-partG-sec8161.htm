<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is a worthwhile goal to ensure that all students in America are prepared for responsible citizenship and that all students should have the opportunity to be involved in activities that promote and demonstrate good citizenship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is a worthwhile goal to ensure that America's educators have access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional skills.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Allen J. Ellender, a Senator from Louisiana and President pro tempore of the United States Senate, had a distinguished career in public service characterized by extraordinary energy and real concern for young people. Senator Ellender provided valuable support and encouragement to the Close Up Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit foundation promoting knowledge and understanding of the Federal Government among young people and educators. Therefore, it is a fitting and appropriate tribute to Senator Ellender to provide <!-- PDFPage:1346 -->fellowships in his name to students of limited economic means, the teachers who work with such students, and older Americans, so that such students, teachers, and older Americans may participate in the programs supported by the Close Up Foundation.</p>
