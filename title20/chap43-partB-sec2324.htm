The State board shall, in developing such plan, take into consideration the relative training and retraining needs of secondary, adult, and postsecondary students, and shall include the State's rationale for distribution of funds. If a State agency finds that a portion of the final State plan is objectionable, such agency shall file such objections with the State board. The State board shall respond to any objections of such agency in submitting such plan to the Secretary. The Secretary shall consider such comments in reviewing the State plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time for submission; approval</h4>
