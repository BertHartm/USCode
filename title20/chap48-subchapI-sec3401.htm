<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) education is fundamental to the development of individual citizens and the progress of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a continuing need to ensure equal access for all Americans to educational opportunities of a high quality, and such educational opportunities should not be denied because of race, creed, color, national origin, or sex;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) parents have the primary responsibility for the education of their children, and States, localities, and private institutions have the primary responsibility for supporting that parental role;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in our Federal system, the primary public responsibility for education is reserved respectively to the States and the local school systems and other instrumentalities of the States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the American people benefit from a diversity of educational settings, including public and private schools, libraries, museums and other institutions, the workplace, the community, and the home;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:854 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the importance of education is increasing as new technologies and alternative approaches to traditional education are considered, as society becomes more complex, and as equal opportunities in education and employment are promoted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) there is a need for improvement in the management and coordination of Federal education programs to support more effectively State, local, and private institutions, students, and parents in carrying out their educational responsibilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the dispersion of education programs across a large number of Federal agencies has led to fragmented, duplicative, and often inconsistent Federal policies relating to education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Presidential and public consideration of issues relating to Federal education programs is hindered by the present organizational position of education programs in the executive branch of the Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) there is no single, full-time, Federal education official directly accountable to the President, the Congress, and the people.</p>
