<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ability of America's rural public school systems to meet the National Education Goals will contribute to the economic competitiveness and academic standing of the Nation in the world community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) approximately 60 percent of the Nation's public school districts are rural with a population of less than 2,500;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) about 1 out of every 4 of America's rural school children are living below the poverty line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the quality of public education in the rural areas of the Nation has a direct effect on the economic development of the rural communities of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the success of rural public schools in boosting the achievement of minority youth attending such schools will determine the ability of the Nation to close the gap between the haves and the have-nots in society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the academic performance of students in the average rural school system is below that of students in most other suburban school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the average age of rural public school buildings is more than 45 years old and such buildings are often in serious disrepair, creating poor and demoralizing working and learning conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) shortages of teachers for rural public school systems is greater than in other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) solving the challenges facing the Nation's rural public schools will require the concerted and collaborative efforts of all levels of government and all sectors of the community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) additional Federal funding would contribute significantly to addressing the comprehensive needs of rural schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) rural public schools enroll a disproportionately large share of the Nation's poor and at-risk youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) a declining number of rural public secondary school graduates are pursuing postsecondary education opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) rural preschoolers have less access to early childhood development programs than other children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Federal and State funding of rural public schools has not adequately reflected need.</p>
