<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Prior experience</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making grants under this division, the Secretary shall consider each applicant's prior experience of high quality service delivery, as determined under subsection (f), under the particular program for which funds are sought. The level of consideration given the factor of prior experience shall not vary from the level of consideration given such factor during fiscal years 1994 through 1997, except that grants made under section 1070a&ndash;18 of this title shall not be given prior experience consideration.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Participant need</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Order of awards; program fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except with respect to grants made under sections 1070a&ndash;17 and 1070a&ndash;18 of this title and as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall award grants and contracts under this division in the order of the scores received by the application for such grant or contract in the peer review process required under paragraph (4) and adjusted for prior experience in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall not provide assistance to a program otherwise eligible for assistance under this division, if the Secretary has determined that such program has involved the fraudulent use of funds under this division.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Application status</h4>

The Secretary, in the case of an entity that is continuing to operate a successful program under this division, shall ensure that the start-up date for a new grant or contract for such program immediately follows the termination of the preceding grant or contract so that no interruption of funding occurs for such successful reapplicants.
