<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Designation of lenders, servicers, and guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary determines that an eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency has a compliance performance rating that equals or exceeds 97 percent, the Secretary shall designate the eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency, as the case may be, for exceptional performance. The Secretary shall notify each appropriate guaranty agency of the eligible lenders and servicers designated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance performance rating</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a compliance performance rating is determined with respect to compliance with due diligence in the collection of loans under this part for each year for which the determination is made. Such rating is equal to the percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary by regulation, with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) loans serviced during the period by the eligible lender or servicer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) loans on which loan collection was attempted by the guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment to lenders and servicers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) 100 percent payment rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay each eligible lender or servicer (as agent for an eligible lender) designated under subsection (a) of this section 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest of all loans for which claims are submitted for payment by that eligible lender or servicer for the one-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under this section or until the guaranty agency receives notice from the Secretary that the designation of the lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section has been revoked.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall revoke the designation of a lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section if any quarterly audit required under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not received by the Secretary by the date established by the Secretary or if the audit indicates the lender or servicer failed to maintain <!-- PDFPage:350 -->97 percent or higher compliance with program regulations, as reflected in the performance of not less than 97 percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary for the purpose of this section, for 2 consecutive months or 90 percent for 1 month.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit the authority of guaranty agencies to require the submission of claims documentation evidencing servicing performed on loans, except that the guaranty agency may not require greater documentation than that required for lenders and servicers not designated under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payments to guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall pay to each guaranty agency designated under subsection (a) of this section the appropriate percentage under this subsection for the 1-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Supervision of designated lenders and servicers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Audits for lenders and servicers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible lender or servicer desiring a designation under subsection (a) of this section shall have a financial and compliance audit of the loan portfolio of such eligible lender or servicer conducted annually by a qualified independent organization from a list of qualified organizations promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General and the Secretary. The standards shall measure the lender's or servicer's compliance with the due diligence standards and shall include a defined statistical sampling technique designed to measure the performance rating of the eligible lender or servicer for the purpose of this section. Each eligible lender or servicer shall submit the audit required by this section to the Secretary and to each appropriate guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional information on lenders and servicers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each appropriate guaranty agency shall provide the Secretary with such other information in its possession regarding an eligible lender or servicer desiring designation as may relate to the Secretary's determination under subsection (a) of this section, including but not limited to any information suggesting that the application of a lender or servicer for designation under subsection (a) of this section should not be approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section, such other information as provided by any guaranty agency under paragraph (2), and any information in the possession of the Secretary or submitted by any other agency or office of the Federal Government. If the results of the audit are not persuasively rebutted by such other information, the Secretary shall inform the eligible lender or servicer and the appropriate guaranty agency that its application for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer has been approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cost of audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible lender or servicer shall pay for all the costs of the audits required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Compliance audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to maintain its status as an exceptional eligible lender or servicer, the lender or servicer shall undergo a quarterly compliance audit at the end of each quarter (other than the quarter in which status as an exceptional lender or servicer is established through a financial and compliance audit, as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section), and submit the results of such audit to the Secretary and such appropriate guaranty agency. The compliance audit will review compliance with due diligence requirements for the period since the last audit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Loss of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the audit performed pursuant to paragraph (5) fails to meet the standards for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the lender or servicer shall lose its designation as an exceptional lender or servicer. A lender or servicer receiving a compliance audit not meeting the standard for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer may reapply for designation under subsection (a) of this section at any time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Due diligence standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Due diligence standards used for determining compliance under paragraph (5) shall be promulgated by the Secretary after consultation with lenders, guaranty agencies and servicers and shall consist of a list of specific elements for the Federal regulations selected to provide an indication of systems degradation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Additional revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, designation under subsection (a) of this section may be revoked at any time by the Secretary if the Secretary determines that the eligible lender or servicer has failed to maintain an overall level of regulatory compliance consistent with the audit submitted by the eligible lender or servicer under this section or if the Secretary believes the lender or servicer may have engaged in fraud in securing designation under subsection (a) of this section or is failing to service loans in accordance with program regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of designated guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Audit of guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency desiring a designation under subsection (a) of this section shall have a financial and compliance audit of the defaulted loan portfolio of such guaranty agency conducted annually by a qualified independent organization or person from a list of qualified organizations or persons promulgated by the <!-- PDFPage:351 -->Secretary in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General and the Secretary. The standards shall include defined statistical sampling techniques designed to measure the performance rating of the guaranty agency for the purpose of this section. Each guaranty agency shall submit the audit required by this paragraph to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quarterly sample audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may require quarterly sample audits as a means of determining continued qualification of the guaranty agency for designation as an exceptional guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section and other information in his possession. If the results of the audit are not persuasively rebutted by such other information, the Secretary shall inform the guaranty agency that its application for designation as an exceptional guaranty agency has been approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Costs of audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay for all of the costs of the audits regulated by this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation for fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may revoke the designation of a guaranty agency under subsection (a) of this section at any time if the Secretary has reason to believe the guaranty agency secured its designation under subsection (a) of this section through fraud or fails to comply with applicable regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Revocation based on performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Designation as an exceptional guaranty agency may be revoked at any time by the Secretary upon 30 days notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary upon a finding by the Secretary that the guaranty agency has failed to maintain an acceptable overall level of regulatory compliance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursements made by the Secretary on loans submitted for claim by an eligible lender or loan servicer designated for exceptional performance under this section shall not be subject to additional review by the Secretary or repurchase by the guaranty agency for any reason other than a determination by the Secretary that the eligible lender, loan servicer, or guaranty agency engaged in fraud or other purposeful misconduct in obtaining designation for exceptional performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the processing of claims on student loans of eligible lenders not subject to this paragraph.</p>
