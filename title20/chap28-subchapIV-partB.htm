<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose of and authority for advances to reserve funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose; eligible recipients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From sums appropriated pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4)(A) of section 1071(b) of this title, the Secretary is authorized to make advances to any State with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title for the purpose of helping to establish or strengthen the reserve fund of the student loan insurance program covered by that agreement. If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title, and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title in order to enable students in the State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such an agreement. The Secretary may make advances under this subsection both to a State program (with which he has such an agreement) and to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations (with which he has such an agreement) in that State if he determines that such advances are necessary in order that students in each eligible institution have access through such institution to a student loan insurance program which meets the requirements of section 1078(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Matching requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No advance shall be made after June 30, 1968, unless matched by an equal amount from non-Federal sources. Such equal amount may include the unencumbered non-Federal portion of a reserve fund. As used in the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;unencumbered non-Federal portion&rdquo; means the amount (determined as of the time immediately preceding the making of the advance) of the reserve fund less the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) advances made under this section prior to July 1, 1968;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an amount equal to twice the amount of advances made under this section after June 30, 1968, and before the advance for purposes of which the determination is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proceeds of earnings on advances made under this section; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount which is required to be maintained in such fund pursuant to State law or regulation, or by agreement with lenders, as a reserve against the insurance of outstanding loans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Except as provided in section 1078(c)(9)(E) or (F) of this title, such unencumbered non-Fed<!-- PDFPage:292 -->eral portion shall not be subject to recall, repayment, or recovery by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms and conditions; repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Advances pursuant to this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions (including conditions relating to the time or times of payment) consistent with the requirements of section 1078(b) of this title as the Secretary determines will best carry out the purpose of this section. Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate in each case in the light of the maturity and solvency of the reserve fund for which the advance was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on total advances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total of the advances from the sums appropriated pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of section 1071(b) of this title to nonprofit private institutions and organizations for the benefit of students in any State and to such State may not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of such State aged 18 to 22, inclusive, bears to the population of all the States aged 18 to 22 inclusive, but such advances may otherwise be in such amounts as the Secretary determines will best achieve the purposes for which they are made. The amount available for advances to any State shall not be less than $25,000 and any additional funds needed to meet this requirement shall be derived by proportionately reducing (but not below $25,000) the amount available for advances to each of the remaining States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculation of population</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of this subsection, the population aged 18 to 22, inclusive, of each State and of all the States shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available to him.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Advances for insurance obligations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use for payment of insurance obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From sums appropriated pursuant to section 1071(b)(4)(B) of this title, the Secretary shall advance to each State which has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1078(c) of this title with respect to a student loan insurance program, an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection to be used for the purpose of making payments under the State's insurance obligations under such program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount to be advanced to each such State shall be equal to 10 percent of the principal amount of loans made by lenders and insured by such agency on those loans on which the first payment of principal became due during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the advance is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount of any advance determined according to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be reduced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount of any advance or advances made to such State pursuant to this subsection at an earlier date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount of the unspent balance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and the preceding sentence of this subparagraph, but subject to subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, the amount of any advance to a State described in paragraph (5)(A) for the first year of its eligibility under such paragraph, and the amount of any advance to any State described in paragraph (5)(B) for each year of its eligibility under such paragraph, shall not be less than $50,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For the purpose of subparagraph (B), the unspent balance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be that portion of the balance of the State's reserve fund (remaining at the time of the State's first request for an advance pursuant to this subsection) which bears the same ratio to such balance as the Federal advances made and not returned by such State, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, bears to the total of all past contributions to such reserve funds from all sources (other than interest on investment of any portion of the reserve fund) contributed since the date such State executed an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for paying the amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) are not sufficient to pay such amounts in full, then such amounts shall be reduced&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by ratably reducing that portion of the amount allocated to each State which exceeds $50,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if further reduction is required, by equally reducing the $50,000 minimum allocation of each State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If additional sums become available for paying such amounts for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence has been applied, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of earnings for insurance obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings, if any, on any investments of advances received pursuant to this subsection must be used for making payments under the State's insurance obligations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Repayment of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall, subject to subsection (d) of this section, be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate and shall be deposited in the fund established by section 1081 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on number of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), advances pursuant to this subsection shall be made to a State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a State which is actively carrying on a program under an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title which was entered into before October 12, 1976, upon such date as such State may request, but not before October 1, 1977, and on the same day of each of the 2 succeeding calendar years after the date so requested; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:293 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a State which enters into an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title on or after October 12, 1976, or which is not actively carrying on a program under an agreement pursuant to such section on such date, upon such date as such State may request, but not before October 1, 1977, and on the same day of each of the 4 succeeding calendar years after the date so requested of the advance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Payment of advances where no State program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title, and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances pursuant to this subsection for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which he has made an agreement pursuant to subsection (c), as well as subsection (b), of section 1078 of this title and subparagraph (B) of this paragraph in order to enable students in that State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such agreements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a private nonprofit institution or organization for the purpose of this paragraph under which such institution or organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) agrees to establish within such State at least one office with sufficient staff to handle written, electronic, and telephone inquiries from students, eligible lenders, and other persons in the State, to encourage maximum commercial lender participation within the State, and to conduct periodic visits to at least the major eligible lenders within the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) agrees that its insurance will not be denied any student because of his or her choice of eligible institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) certifies that it is neither an eligible institution, nor has any substantial affiliation with an eligible institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Emergency advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary is authorized to make advances, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Secretary, to a guaranty agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title, in order to ensure that the guaranty agency shall make loans as the lender-of-last-resort; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the Secretary is seeking to terminate the guaranty agency's agreement, or assuming the guaranty agency's functions, in accordance with section 1078(c)(9)(F)(v) of this title, in order to assist the agency in meeting its immediate cash needs, ensure the uninterrupted payment of claims, or ensure that the guaranty agency shall make loans as described in subparagraph (A).</p>

The Secretary shall, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (2), recover (and so deposit) an amount equal to $75,000,000 during fiscal year 1988 and an amount equal to $35,000,000 for fiscal year 1989.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of guaranty agency obligations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Correction for errors under reduction of excess cash reserves</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of reimbursement for claims shall be equal to the amount of reimbursement for claims withheld or canceled in order to be applied to such agency's obligation to eliminate excess cash reserves which exceeds the amount of that which would have been withheld or canceled if the maximum excess cash reserves had been accurately calculated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Refund of cash reserve payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, within 30 days after July 23, 1992, pay the full amount of payments withheld or canceled under paragraph (3) of this subsection to any guaranty agency which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) was required to eliminate excess cash reserves, based on the maximum cash reserve (as described in subsection (e) of this section as in <!-- PDFPage:294 -->effect on September 1, 1988) permitted at the end of 1986;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) appealed the Secretary's demand that such agency should eliminate such excess cash reserves and received a waiver of a portion of the amount of such excess cash reserves to be eliminated;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to recover funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the reserve funds of the guaranty agencies, and any assets purchased with such reserve funds, regardless of who holds or controls the reserves or assets, shall be considered to be the property of the United States to be used in the operation of the program authorized by this part. However, the Secretary may not require the return of all reserve funds of a guaranty agency to the Secretary unless the Secretary determines that such return is in the best interest of the operation of the program authorized by this part, or to ensure the proper maintenance of such agency's funds or assets or the orderly termination of the guaranty agency's operations and the liquidation of its assets. The reserves shall be maintained by each guaranty agency to pay program expenses and contingent liabilities, as authorized by the Secretary, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary may direct a guaranty agency to return to the Secretary a portion of its reserve fund which the Secretary determines is unnecessary to pay the program expenses and contingent liabilities of the guaranty agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Secretary may direct a guaranty agency, or such agency's officers or directors, to cease any activities involving expenditure, use or transfer of the guaranty agency's reserve funds or assets which the Secretary determines is a misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure of such funds or assets; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any such determination under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be based on standards prescribed by regulations that are developed through negotiated rulemaking and that include procedures for administrative due process.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination provisions in contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To ensure that the funds and assets of the guaranty agency are preserved, any contract with respect to the administration of a guaranty agency's reserve funds, or the administration of any assets purchased or acquired with the reserve funds of the guaranty agency, that is entered into or extended by the guaranty agency, or any other party on behalf of or with the concurrence of the guaranty agency, after August 10, 1993, shall provide that the contract is terminable by the Secretary upon 30 days notice to the contracting parties if the Secretary determines that such contract includes an impermissible transfer of the reserve funds or assets, or is otherwise inconsistent with the terms or purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary may direct a guaranty agency to suspend or cease activities under any contract entered into by or on behalf of such agency after January 1, 1993, if the Secretary determines that the misuse or improper expenditure of such guaranty agency's funds or assets or such contract provides unnecessary or improper benefits to such agency's officers or directors.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, recall $1,000,000,000 from the reserve funds held by guaranty agencies on September 1, 2002.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds recalled by the Secretary under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Required share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall require each guaranty agency to return reserve funds under paragraph (1) based on the agency's required share of recalled reserve funds held by guaranty agencies as of September 30, 1996. For purposes of this paragraph, a guaranty agency's required share of recalled reserve funds shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary shall compute each guaranty agency's reserve ratio by dividing <!-- PDFPage:295 -->(i) the amount held in the agency's reserve funds as of September 30, 1996 (but reflecting later accounting or auditing adjustments approved by the Secretary), by (ii) the original principal amount of all loans for which the agency has an outstanding insurance obligation as of such date, including amounts of outstanding loans transferred to the agency from another guaranty agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the reserve ratio of any guaranty agency as computed under subparagraph (A) exceeds 2.0 percent, the agency's required share shall include so much of the amounts held in the agency's reserve funds as exceed a reserve ratio of 2.0 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If any additional amount is required to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraph (B)), such additional amount shall be obtained by imposing on each guaranty agency an equal percentage reduction in the amount of the agency's reserve funds remaining after deduction of the amount recalled under subparagraph (B), except that such percentage reduction under this subparagraph shall not result in the agency's reserve ratio being reduced below 0.58 percent. The equal percentage reduction shall be the percentage obtained by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the additional amount required to be recalled (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraph (B)), by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total amount of all such agencies&rsquo; reserve funds remaining (after deduction of the required shares calculated under such subparagraph).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If any additional amount is required to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraphs (B) and (C)), such additional amount shall be obtained by imposing on each guaranty agency with a reserve ratio (after deducting the required shares calculated under such subparagraphs) in excess of 0.58 percent an equal percentage reduction in the amount of the agency's reserve funds remaining (after such deduction) that exceed a reserve ratio of 0.58 percent. The equal percentage reduction shall be the percentage obtained by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the additional amount to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the amount recalled under subparagraphs (B) and (C)), by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total amount of all such agencies&rsquo; reserve funds remaining (after deduction of the required shares calculated under such subparagraphs) that exceed a reserve ratio of 0.58 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Restricted accounts required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 90 days after the beginning of each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, each guaranty agency shall transfer a portion of the agency's required share determined under paragraph (3) to a restricted account established by the agency that is of a type selected by the agency with the approval of the Secretary. Funds transferred to such restricted accounts shall be invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or in other similarly low-risk securities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A guaranty agency shall not use the funds in such a restricted account for any purpose without the express written permission of the Secretary, except that a guaranty agency may use the earnings from such restricted account for default reduction activities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Installments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In each of fiscal years 1998 through 2002, each guaranty agency shall transfer the agency's required share to such restricted account in 5 equal annual installments, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a guaranty agency that has a reserve ratio (as computed under subparagraph (3)(A)) equal to or less than 1.10 percent may transfer the agency's required share to such account in 4 equal installments beginning in fiscal year 1999; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a guaranty agency may transfer such required share to such account in accordance with such other payment schedules as are approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Shortage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on September 1, 2002, the total amount in the restricted accounts described in paragraph (4) is less than the amount the Secretary is required to recall under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall require the return of the amount of the shortage from other reserve funds held by guaranty agencies under procedures established by the Secretary. The Secretary shall first attempt to obtain the amount of such shortage from each guaranty agency that failed to transfer the agency's required share to the agency's restricted account in accordance with paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines that a guaranty agency has failed to transfer to a restricted account any portion of the agency's required share under this subsection, the agency may not receive any other funds under this part until the Secretary determines that the agency has so transferred the agency's required share.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may waive the requirements of subparagraph (B) for a guaranty agency described in such subparagraph if the Secretary determines that there are extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the agency that justify such waiver.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), the percentage reduction under subparagraph (B) shall not result in the depletion of the reserve funds of any agency which charges the 1.0 percent insurance premium pursuant to section 1078(b)(1)(H) of this title below an amount equal to the amount of lender claim payments paid during the 90 days prior to the date of the return under this subsection. If any additional amount is required to be returned after deducting the total of the required shares under subparagraph (B) and as a result of the preceding sentence, such additional amount shall be <!-- PDFPage:297 -->obtained by imposing on each guaranty agency to which the preceding sentence does not apply, an equal percentage reduction in the amount of the agency's remaining reserve funds.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Offset of required shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any guaranty agency returns to the Secretary any reserve funds in excess of the amount required under this subsection or subsection (h) of this section, the total amount required to be returned under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the amount of such excess reserve funds returned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition of reserve funds</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investment of funds</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Uses of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (f) of this section, the Federal Fund may only be used by a guaranty agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay lender claims pursuant to sections 1078(b)(1)(G), 1078(j), 1087, and 1087&ndash;2(q) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay into the Agency Operating Fund established pursuant to section 1072b of this title (in this section and section 1072b of this title referred to as the &ldquo;Operating Fund&rdquo;) a default aversion fee in accordance with section 1078(<em>l</em>) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Ownership of Federal Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Fund, and any nonliquid asset (such as a building or equipment) developed or purchased by the guaranty agency in whole or in part with Federal reserve funds, regardless of who holds or controls the Federal reserve funds or such asset, shall be considered to be the property of the United States, prorated based on the percentage of such asset developed or purchased with Federal reserve funds, which property shall be used in the operation of the program authorized by this part, as provided in subsection (d) of this section. The Secretary may restrict or regulate the use of such asset only to the extent necessary to reasonably protect the Secretary's prorated share of the value of such asset. The Secretary may direct a guaranty agency, or such agency's officers or directors, to cease any activity involving expenditures, use, or transfer of the Federal Fund administered by the guaranty agency that the Secretary determines is a misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure of the Federal Fund or the Secretary's share of such asset.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to establish the Operating Fund, each guaranty agency may transfer not more than 180 days&rsquo; cash expenses for normal operating expenses (not including claim payments) as a working capital reserve as defined in Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;87 (Cost Accounting Standards) from the Federal Fund for deposit into the Operating Fund for use in the performance of the guaranty agency's duties under this part. Such transfers may occur during the first 3 years following the establishment of the Operating Fund. However, no agency may transfer in excess of 45 percent of the balance, as of September 30, 1998, of the agency's Federal Fund to the agency's Operating Fund during such 3-year period. In determining the amount that may be transferred, the agency shall ensure that sufficient funds remain in the Federal Fund to pay lender claims within the required time periods and to meet the reserve recall requirements of this section and subsections (h) and (i) of section 1072 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A limited number of guaranty agencies may transfer interest earned on the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund during the first 3 years after October 7, 1998, if the guaranty agency demonstrates to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cash flow in the Operating Fund will be negative without the transfer of such interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transfer of such interest will substantially improve the financial circumstances of the guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Repayment provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall begin repayment of sums transferred pursuant to this subsection not later than the start of the fourth year after the establishment of the Operating Fund, and shall repay all amounts transferred not later than 5 years from the date of the establishment of the Operating Fund. With respect to amounts transferred from the Federal Fund, the guaranty agency shall not be required to repay any interest on the funds transferred and subsequently repaid. The guaranty agency shall provide to the Secretary a reasonable schedule for repayment of the sums transferred and an annual financial analysis demonstrating the agency's ability to comply with the schedule and repay all outstanding sums transferred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a guaranty agency transfers funds from the Federal Fund in accordance with this section, and fails to make scheduled repayments to the Federal Fund, the agency may not receive any other funds under this part until the Secretary determines that the agency has made such repayments. The Secretary shall pay to the guaranty agency any funds withheld in accordance with this paragraph immediately upon making the determination that the guaranty agency has made all such repayments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) waive the requirements of paragraph (3), but only with respect to repayment of interest that was transferred in accordance with paragraph (2); and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:299 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) waive paragraph (4);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">for a guaranty agency, if the Secretary determines that there are extenuating circumstances (such as State constitutional prohibitions) beyond the control of the agency that justify such a waiver.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Extension of repayment period for interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Extension permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall extend the period for repayment of interest that was transferred in accordance with paragraph (2) from 2 years to 5 years if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the cash flow of the Operating Fund will be negative as a result of repayment as required by paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the repayment of the interest transferred will substantially diminish the financial circumstances of the guaranty agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the guaranty agency has demonstrated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) that the agency is able to repay all transferred funds by the end of the 8th year following the date of establishment of the Operating Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that the agency will be financially sound on the completion of repayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repayment of income on transferred funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All repayments made to the Federal Fund during the 6th, 7th, and 8th years following the establishment of the Operating Fund of interest that was transferred shall include the sums transferred plus any income earned from the investment of the sums transferred after the 5th year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Investment of Federal funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds transferred from the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund for operating expenses shall be invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or a State, or in other similarly low-risk securities selected by the guaranty agency, with the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In calculating the minimum reserve level required by section 1078(c)(9)(A) of this title, the Secretary shall include all amounts owed to the Federal Fund by the guaranty agency in the calculation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Repayment of principal on loans made under this section shall commence not later than 60 days after the date such loan is disbursed by the lender, subject to deferral during any period during which the parent meets the conditions required for a deferral under section 1077(a)(2)(C) or 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title.</p>

Unless the consolidated loan is obtained by a borrower who is electing to obtain variable interest under paragraph (2) or (3), such consolidated loan shall bear interest at the weighted average of the rates of all included loans. The extension of any repayment period of an included loan pursuant to this paragraph shall be reported (if required by them) to the Secretary or guaranty agency insuring the loan, as the case may be, but no additional insurance premiums shall be payable with respect to any such extension. The extension of the repayment period of any included loan shall not require the formal extension of the promissory note evidencing the included loan or the execution of a new promissory note, but shall be treated as an administrative forbearance of the repayment terms of the included loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Refinancing to secure variable interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An eligible lender may reissue a loan which was made under this section before July 1, 1987, or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, in order to permit the borrower to obtain the interest rate provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.

Reissuance of a loan under this paragraph shall not affect any insurance applicable with respect to the loan, and no additional insurance fee may be charged to the borrower with respect to the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refinancing by discharge of previous loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A borrower who has applied to an original lender for reissuance of a loan under paragraph (2) and who is denied such reissuance may obtain a loan from another lender for the purpose of discharging the loan from such original lender.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall bear interest at the applicable rate of interest provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall not result in the extension of the duration of the note (other than as permitted under subsection (c)(5)(B) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may be subject to an additional insurance fee but shall not be subject to the administrative cost charge permitted by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall be applied to discharge the borrower from any remaining obligation to the original lender with respect to the original loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certification in lieu of promissory note presentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each new lender may accept certification from the original lender of the borrower's original loan in lieu of presentation of the original promissory note.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each holder of a loan made under this section or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, shall, not later than October 1, 1987, in the case of loans made before October 17, 1986, notify the borrower of such loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) of the refinancing options for which the borrower is eligible under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) of those options which will be made available by the holder and of the practical consequences of such options in terms of interest rates and monthly and total payments for a set of loan examples; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that, with respect to any option that the holder will not make available, the holder will, to the extent practicable, refer the borrower to an eligible lender offering such option.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) immigration status in the same manner as immigration status is verified for students under section 1091(g) of this title; and</p>

Such loan shall not be sold to an eligible lender who has been found by the guaranty agency or the Secretary to have substantially failed to exercise the due diligence required of lenders under this part. Neither the guaranty agency nor the Secretary shall demand from a borrower as monthly payment amounts referred to in this paragraph more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An agreement between the guaranty agency and the Secretary for purposes of this paragraph shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the repayment by the agency to the Secretary of 81.5 percent of the amount of the principal balance outstanding at the time of such sale, multiplied by the reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the guaranty agreement was made with respect to the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for the reinstatement by the Secretary (I) of the obligation to reimburse such agency for the amount expended by it in discharge of its insurance obligation under its loan insurance program, and (II) of the obligation to pay to the holder of such loan a special allowance pursuant to section 1087&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A loan which does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) may also be eligible for sale under this paragraph upon a determination that the loan was in default due to clerical or data processing error and would not, in the absence of such error, be in a delinquent status.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:348 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of proceeds of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts received by the Secretary pursuant to the sale of such loans by a guaranty agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be deducted from the calculations of the amount of reimbursement for which the agency is eligible under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection for the fiscal year in which the amount was received, notwithstanding the fact that the default occurred in a prior fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Borrower eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any borrower whose loan is sold under paragraph (1) shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional loans or grants under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (for which he or she is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such loan sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability of general loan conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan which is sold under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, so long as the borrower continues to make scheduled repayments thereon, be subject to the same terms and conditions and qualify for the same benefits and privileges as other loans made under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Satisfactory repayment arrangements to renew eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each guaranty agency shall establish a program which allows a borrower with a defaulted loan or loans to renew eligibility for all title IV student financial assistance (regardless of whether the defaulted loan has been sold to an eligible lender) upon the borrower's payment of 6 consecutive monthly payments. The guaranty agency shall not demand from a borrower as a monthly payment amount under this subsection more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. A borrower may only obtain the benefit of this subsection with respect to renewed eligibility once.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of amount of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) of this section shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assist<!-- PDFPage:351 -->ance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Qualification for forbearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A lender may grant the borrower of a loan under this section a forbearance for a period not to exceed 60 days if the lender reasonably determines that such a forbearance from collection activity is warranted following a borrower's request for forbearance, deferment, or a change in repayment plan, or a request to consolidate loans in order to collect or process appropriate supporting documentation related to the request. During any such period, interest on the loan shall accrue but not be capitalized.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Designation of lenders, servicers, and guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary determines that an eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency has a compliance performance rating that equals or exceeds 97 percent, the Secretary shall designate the eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency, as the case may be, for exceptional performance. The Secretary shall notify each appropriate guaranty agency of <!-- PDFPage:354 -->the eligible lenders and servicers designated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance performance rating</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a compliance performance rating is determined with respect to compliance with due diligence in the collection of loans under this part for each year for which the determination is made. Such rating is equal to the percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary by regulation, with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) loans serviced during the period by the eligible lender or servicer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) loans on which loan collection was attempted by the guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment to lenders and servicers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) 100 percent payment rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay each eligible lender or servicer (as agent for an eligible lender) designated under subsection (a) of this section 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest of all loans for which claims are submitted for payment by that eligible lender or servicer for the one-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under this section or until the guaranty agency receives notice from the Secretary that the designation of the lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section has been revoked.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall revoke the designation of a lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section if any quarterly audit required under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not received by the Secretary by the date established by the Secretary or if the audit indicates the lender or servicer failed to maintain 97 percent or higher compliance with program regulations, as reflected in the performance of not less than 97 percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary for the purpose of this section, for 2 consecutive months or 90 percent for 1 month.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit the authority of guaranty agencies to require the submission of claims documentation evidencing servicing performed on loans, except that the guaranty agency may not require greater documentation than that required for lenders and servicers not designated under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payments to guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall pay to each guaranty agency designated under subsection (a) of this section the appropriate percentage under this subsection for the 1-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Supervision of designated lenders and servicers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Audits for lenders and servicers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible lender or servicer desiring a designation under subsection (a) of this section shall have a financial and compliance audit of the loan portfolio of such eligible lender or servicer conducted annually by a qualified independent organization from a list of qualified organizations promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General and the Secretary. The standards shall measure the lender's or servicer's compliance with the due diligence standards and shall include a defined statistical sampling technique designed to measure the performance rating of the eligible lender or servicer for the purpose of this section. Each eligible lender or servicer shall submit the audit required by this section to the Secretary and to each appropriate guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional information on lenders and servicers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each appropriate guaranty agency shall provide the Secretary with such other information in its possession regarding an eligible lender or servicer desiring designation as may relate to the Secretary's determination under subsection (a) of this section, including but not limited to any information suggesting that the application of a lender or servicer for designation under subsection (a) of this section should not be approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section, such other information as provided by any guaranty agency under paragraph (2), and any information in the possession of the Secretary or submitted by any other agency or office of the Federal Government. If the results of the audit are not persuasively rebutted by such other information, the Secretary shall inform the eligible lender or servicer and the appropriate guaranty agency that its application for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer has been approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cost of audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible lender or servicer shall pay for all the costs of the audits required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Compliance audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to maintain its status as an exceptional eligible lender or servicer, the lender or servicer shall undergo a quarterly compliance audit at the end of each quarter (other than the quarter in which status as an exceptional lender or servicer is established through a financial and compliance audit, as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section), and submit the results of such audit to the Secretary and such appropriate guaranty agency. The compliance audit will review compliance with due diligence requirements for the period since the last audit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Loss of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the audit performed pursuant to paragraph (5) fails to meet the standards for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the lender or servicer shall lose its designation as <!-- PDFPage:355 -->an exceptional lender or servicer. A lender or servicer receiving a compliance audit not meeting the standard for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer may reapply for designation under subsection (a) of this section at any time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Due diligence standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Due diligence standards used for determining compliance under paragraph (5) shall be promulgated by the Secretary after consultation with lenders, guaranty agencies and servicers and shall consist of a list of specific elements for the Federal regulations selected to provide an indication of systems degradation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Additional revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, designation under subsection (a) of this section may be revoked at any time by the Secretary if the Secretary determines that the eligible lender or servicer has failed to maintain an overall level of regulatory compliance consistent with the audit submitted by the eligible lender or servicer under this section or if the Secretary believes the lender or servicer may have engaged in fraud in securing designation under subsection (a) of this section or is failing to service loans in accordance with program regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of designated guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Audit of guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency desiring a designation under subsection (a) of this section shall have a financial and compliance audit of the defaulted loan portfolio of such guaranty agency conducted annually by a qualified independent organization or person from a list of qualified organizations or persons promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General and the Secretary. The standards shall include defined statistical sampling techniques designed to measure the performance rating of the guaranty agency for the purpose of this section. Each guaranty agency shall submit the audit required by this paragraph to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quarterly sample audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may require quarterly sample audits as a means of determining continued qualification of the guaranty agency for designation as an exceptional guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section and other information in his possession. If the results of the audit are not persuasively rebutted by such other information, the Secretary shall inform the guaranty agency that its application for designation as an exceptional guaranty agency has been approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Costs of audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay for all of the costs of the audits regulated by this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation for fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may revoke the designation of a guaranty agency under subsection (a) of this section at any time if the Secretary has reason to believe the guaranty agency secured its designation under subsection (a) of this section through fraud or fails to comply with applicable regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Revocation based on performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Designation as an exceptional guaranty agency may be revoked at any time by the Secretary upon 30 days notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary upon a finding by the Secretary that the guaranty agency has failed to maintain an acceptable overall level of regulatory compliance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursements made by the Secretary on loans submitted for claim by an eligible lender or loan servicer designated for exceptional performance under this section shall not be subject to additional review by the Secretary or repurchase by the guaranty agency for any reason other than a determination by the Secretary that the eligible lender, loan servicer, or guaranty agency engaged in fraud or other purposeful misconduct in obtaining designation for exceptional performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the processing of claims on student loans of eligible lenders not subject to this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Claims</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loan-by-loan insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to issue certificates on application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, upon application by an eligible lender, made upon such form, containing such information, and supported by such evidence as the Secretary may require, and otherwise in conformity with this section, the Secretary finds that the applicant has made a loan to an eligible student which is insurable under the provisions of this part, he may issue to the applicant a certificate of insurance covering the loan and setting forth the amount and terms of the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effectiveness of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall become effective upon the date of issuance of the certificate, except that the Secretary is authorized, in accordance with regulations, to issue commitments with respect to proposed loans, or with respect to lines (or proposed lines) of credit, submitted by eligible lenders, and in that event, upon compliance with subsection (a)(1) of this section by the lender, the certificate of insurance may be issued effective as of the date when any loan, or any payment by the lender pursuant to a line of credit, to be covered by such insurance was made. Such insurance shall cease to be effective upon 60 days&rsquo; default by the lender in the payment of any installment of the premiums payable pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contents of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An application submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall contain (A) an agreement by the applicant to pay, in accordance with regulations, the premiums fixed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and (B) an agreement by the applicant that if the loan is covered by insurance the applicant will submit such supplementary reports and statement during the effective period of the loan agreement, upon such forms, at such times, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe by or pursuant to regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Comprehensive insurance coverage certificate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of system by regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of requiring a separate insurance application and issuing a separate certificate of insurance for each student loan made by an eligible lender as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations consistent with section 1074 of this title, issue to any eligible lender applying therefor a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage which shall, without further action by the Secretary, insure all insurable loans made by that lender, on or after the date of the certificate and before a specified cutoff date, within the limits of an aggregate maximum amount stated in the certificate. Such regulations may provide for conditioning such insurance, with respect to any loan, upon compliance by the lender with such requirements (to be stated or incorporated by reference in the certificate) as in the Secretary's judgment will best achieve the purpose of this subsection while protecting the United States from the risk of unreasonable loss and promoting the objectives of this part, including (but not limited to) provisions as to the reporting of such loans and information relevant thereto to the Secretary and as to the payment of initial and other premiums and the effect of default therein, and including provision for confirmation by the Secretary from time to time (through endorsement of the certificate) of the coverage of specific new loans by such certificate, which confirmation shall be incontestable by the Secretary in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation of fact or patent error.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uncovered loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the holder of a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage issued under this sub<!-- PDFPage:360 -->section grants to a student a line of credit extending beyond the cutoff date specified in that certificate, loans or payments thereon made by the holder after that date pursuant to the line of credit shall not be deemed to be included in the coverage of that certificate except as may be specifically provided therein; but, subject to the limitations of section 1074 of this title, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations, make commitments to insure such future loans or payments, and such commitments may be honored either as provided in subsection (a) of this section or by inclusion of such insurance on comprehensive coverage under the subsection for the period or periods in which such future loans or payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Charges for Federal insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, pursuant to regulations, charge for insurance on each loan under this part a premium in an amount not to exceed one-fourth of 1 percent per year of the unpaid principal amount of such loan (excluding interest added to principal), payable in advance, at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations may provide that such premium shall not be payable, or if paid shall be refundable, with respect to any period after default in the payment of principal or interest or after the borrower has died or becomes totally and permanently disabled, if (1) notice of such default or other event has been duly given, and (2) requests for payment of the loss insured against has been made or the Secretary has made such payment on his own motion pursuant to section 1080(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignability of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rights of an eligible lender arising under insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance issued to it under this section may be assigned as security by such lender only to another eligible lender, and subject to regulation by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consolidation not to affect insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The consolidation of the obligations of two or more federally insured loans obtained by a student borrower in any fiscal year into a single obligation evidenced by a single instrument of indebtedness shall not affect the insurance by the United States. If the loans thus consolidated are covered by separate certificates of insurance issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may upon surrender of the original certificates issue a new certificate of insurance in accordance with that subsection upon the consolidated obligation; if they are covered by a single comprehensive certificate issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may amend that certificate accordingly.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1080. Default of student under Federal loan insurance program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to Secretary and payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon default by the student borrower on any loan covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant to this part, and prior to the commencement of suit or other enforcement proceedings upon security for that loan, the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the Secretary, and the Secretary shall if requested (at that time or after further collection efforts) by the beneficiary, or may on the Secretary's own motion, if the insurance is still in effect, pay to the beneficiary the amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan as soon as that amount has been determined. The &ldquo;amount of the loss&rdquo; on any loan shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the principal amount and accrued interest, including interest accruing from the date of submission of a valid default claim (as determined by the Secretary) to the date on which payment is authorized by the Secretary, reduced to the extent required by section 1075(b) of this title. Such beneficiary shall be required to meet the standards of due diligence in the collection of the loan and shall be required to submit proof that the institution was contacted and other reasonable attempts were made to locate the borrower (when the location of the borrower is unknown) and proof that contact was made with the borrower (when the location is known). The Secretary shall make the determination required to carry out the provisions of this section not later than 90 days after the notification by the insurance beneficiary and shall make payment in full on the amount of the beneficiary's loss pending completion of the due diligence investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon payment of the amount of the loss pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated for all of the rights of the holder of the obligation upon the insured loan and shall be entitled to an assignment of the note or other evidence of the insured loan by the insurance beneficiary. If the net recovery made by the Secretary on a loan after deduction of the cost of that recovery (including reasonable administrative costs and collection costs, to the extent set forth in regulations issued by the Secretary) exceeds the amount of the loss, the excess shall be paid over to the insured. The Secretary may, in attempting to make recovery on such loans, contract with private business concerns, State student loan insurance agencies, or State guaranty agencies, for payment for services rendered by such concerns or agencies in assisting the Secretary in making such recovery. Any contract under this subsection entered into by the Secretary shall provide that attempts to make recovery on such loans shall be fair and reasonable, and do not involve harassment, intimidation, false or misleading representations, or un<!-- PDFPage:361 -->necessary communications concerning the existence of any such loan to persons other than the student borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forbearance not precluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the student borrower which may be agreed upon by the parties to the insured loan and approved by the Secretary, or to preclude forbearance by the Secretary in the enforcement of the insured obligation after payment on that insurance. Any forbearance which is approved by the Secretary under this subsection with respect to the repayment of a loan, including a forbearance during default, shall not be considered as indicating that a holder of a federally insured loan has failed to exercise reasonable care and due diligence in the collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Care and diligence required of holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to excuse the holder of a federally insured loan from exercising reasonable care and diligence in the making and collection of loans under the provisions of this part. If the Secretary, after a reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to an eligible lender, finds that it has substantially failed to exercise such care and diligence or to make the reports and statements required under section 1078(a)(4) of this title and section 1079(a)(3) of this title, or to pay the required Federal loan insurance premiums, the Secretary shall disqualify that lender for further Federal insurance on loans granted pursuant to this part until the Secretary is satisfied that its failure has ceased and finds that there is reasonable assurance that the lender will in the future exercise necessary care and diligence or comply with such requirements, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Default rate of lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall annually publish a list indicating the cohort default rate (determined in accordance with section 1085(m) of this title) for each originating lender, subsequent holder, and guaranty agency participating in the program assisted under this part and an average cohort default rate for all institutions of higher education within each State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a cohort default rate through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control, or any similar device.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rate establishment and correction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a cohort default rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies (determined consistent with section 1085(m) of this title), except that the rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies shall not reflect any loans issued in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title. The Secretary shall allow institutions, lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies the opportunity to correct such cohort default rate information.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established a student loan insurance fund (hereinafter in this section called the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;) which shall be available without fiscal year limitation to the Secretary for making payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with payments under a guaranty agreement under section 1078(c) of this title. All amounts received by the Secretary as premium charges for insurance and as receipts, earnings, or proceeds derived from any claim or other assets acquired by the Secretary in connection with operations under this part, any excess advances under section 1072 of this title, and any other moneys, property, or assets derived by the Secretary from operations in connection with this section, shall be deposited in the fund. All payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with such guaranty agreements shall be paid from the fund.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) an explanation of any cost the borrower may incur in the making or collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required disclosure before repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each eligible lender shall, at or prior to the start of the repayment period of the student borrower on loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, disclose to the borrower by written or electronic means the information required under this subsection in simple and understandable terms. Each eligible lender shall provide to each borrower a telephone number, and may provide an electronic address, through which additional loan information can be obtained. For any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, other than a loan made under section 1078&ndash;2 or 1078&ndash;3 of this title, such disclosure required by this subsection shall be made not less than 30 days nor more than 240 days before the first payment on the loan is due from the borrower. The disclosure shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the scheduled date upon which the repayment period is to begin;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the estimated balance owed by the borrower on the loan or loans covered by the disclosure as of the scheduled date on which the repayment period is to begin (including, if applicable, the estimated amount of interest to be capitalized);</p>

The failure of an eligible lender to provide information as required by this section shall not (1) relieve a borrower of the obligation to repay a loan in accordance with its terms, (2) provide a basis for a claim for civil damages, or (3) be deemed to abrogate the obligation of the Secretary under a contract of insurance or reinsurance, or the obligation of a guaranty agency under a contract of guaranty. Nothing in this section shall be construed as subjecting the lender to the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] with regard to loans made under this part. The Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the continued participation of an eligible lender in making loans under this part for failure by that lender to comply with this section.</p>

The requirement of this subsection shall be in addition to the information required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special disclosure rules on SLS loans and PLUS loans and unsubsidized loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans made under sections 1078&ndash;1,<sup><a href="#1083_2_target" name="1083_2">2</a></sup> 1078&ndash;2, and 1078&ndash;8 of this title shall not be subject to the disclosure of projected monthly payment amounts required under subsection (b)(8) of this section if the lender, in lieu of such disclosure, provides the borrower with sample projections of monthly repayment amounts assuming different levels of borrowing and interest accruals resulting from capitalization of interest while the borrower is in school.

<p class="statutory-body">As used in this part:</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligible institution</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;eligible institution&rdquo; means an institution of higher education, as defined in section 1002 of this title, except that, for the purposes of sections 1077(a)(2)(C)(i) and 1078(b)(1)(M)(i) of this title, an eligible institution includes any institution that is within this definition without regard to whether such institution is participating in any program under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and includes any institution ineligible for participation in any program under this part pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Ineligibility based on high default rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An institution whose cohort default rate is equal to or greater than the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available shall not be eligible to participate in a program under this part for the fiscal year for which the determination is made and for the two succeeding fiscal years, unless, within 30 days of receiving notification from the Secretary of the loss of eligibility under this paragraph, the institution appeals the loss of its eligibility to the Secretary. The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal within 45 days after its submission. Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the Secretary's calculation of its cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce its cohort default rate for any of the three fiscal years below the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) there are exceptional mitigating circumstances within the meaning of paragraph (4); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, other exceptional mitigating circumstances that would make the application of this paragraph inequitable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">During such appeal, the Secretary may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part. If an institution continues to participate in a program under this part, and the institution's appeal of the loss of eligibility is unsuccessful, the institution shall be required to pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount of interest, special allowance, reinsurance, and any related payments made by the Secretary (or which the Secretary is obligated to make) with respect to loans made under this part to students attending, or planning to attend, that institution during the pendency of such appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of determinations under subparagraph (A), the threshold percentage is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 35 percent for fiscal year 1991 and 1992;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) 25 percent for any succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Until July 1, 1999, this paragraph shall not apply to any institution that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a part B institution within the meaning of section 1061(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a tribally controlled community college within the meaning of section 1801(a)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1085_1_target" name="1085_1">1</a></sup> of title 25; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) a Navajo Community College under the Navajo Community College Act [25 U.S.C. 640a et seq.].</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding the first sentence of subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall restore the eligibility to participate in a program under subpart 1 of part A, part B, or part D of this subchapter of an institution that did not appeal its loss of eligibility within 30 days of receiving notification if the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the institution's failure to appeal was substantially justified under the circumstances, and that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the institution made a timely request that the appropriate guaranty agency correct errors in the draft data used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the guaranty agency did not correct the erroneous data in a timely fashion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the institution would have been eligible if the erroneous data had been corrected by the guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appeals based upon allegations of improper loan servicing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An institution that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Family Education Loan Program pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students pursuant to section 1078&ndash;1(a)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1085_1_target" name="1085_1">1</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is an institution whose cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent for the most recent year for which data are available;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">may include in its appeal of such loss or rate a defense based on improper loan servicing (in addition to other defenses). In any such appeal, the Secretary shall take whatever steps <!-- PDFPage:375 -->are necessary to ensure that such institution has access for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days, to a representative sample (as determined by the Secretary) of the relevant loan servicing and collection records used by a guaranty agency in determining whether to pay a claim on a defaulted loan or by the Department in determining an institution's default rate in the loan program under part C of this subchapter. The Secretary shall reduce the institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans in the representative sample that are required to be excluded pursuant to subsection (m)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Definition of mitigating circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), an institution of higher education shall be treated as having exceptional mitigating circumstances that make application of that paragraph inequitable if such institution, in the opinion of an independent auditor, meets the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For a 12-month period that ended during the 6 months immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the cohort of borrowers used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate is determined, at least two-thirds of the students enrolled on at least a half-time basis at the institution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) are eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant award that is at least equal to one-half the maximum Federal Pell Grant award for which a student would be eligible based on the student's enrollment status; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) have an adjusted gross income that when added with the adjusted gross income of the student's parents (unless the student is an independent student), of less than the poverty level, as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In the case of an institution of higher education that offers an associate, baccalaureate, graduate or professional degree, 70 percent or more of the institution's regular students who were initially enrolled on a full-time basis and were scheduled to complete their programs during the same 12-month period described in clause (i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) completed the educational programs in which the students were enrolled;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) transferred from the institution to a higher level educational program;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) entered active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii)(I) In the case of an institution of higher education that does not award a degree described in clause (ii), had a placement rate of 44 percent or more with respect to the institution's former regular students who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(aa) remained in the program beyond the point the students would have received a 100 percent tuition refund from the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(bb) were initially enrolled on at least a half-time basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(cc) were originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete their educational programs during the same 12-month period described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The placement rate shall not include students who are still enrolled and making satisfactory progress in the educational programs in which the students were originally enrolled on the date following 12 months after the date of the student's last date of attendance at the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) The placement rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all those former regular students who&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) The placement rate shall not include as placements a student or former student for whom the institution is the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of determining a rate of completion and a placement rate under this paragraph, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount of time normally required to complete the program. The amount of time normally required to complete the program for a student who is initially enrolled full-time is the period of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a full-time student. For a student who is initially enrolled less than full-time, the period is the amount of time it would take the student to complete the program if the student remained enrolled at that level of enrollment throughout the program.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on <!-- PDFPage:384 -->loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of special allowance</h4>

Such actions may include, in the Board of Director's discretion, a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company with and into the Association, which would have the effect provided in the plan of reorganization and the law of the jurisdiction in which such subsidiary is incorporated. As part of the restructuring, the Board of Directors may cause&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the common shares of the Association to be converted, on the reorganization effective date, to common shares of the Holding Company on a one for one basis, consistent with applicable State or District of Columbia law; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The plan of reorganization adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be submitted to common shareholders of the Association for their approval. The reorganization shall occur on the reorganization effective date, provided that the plan of reorganization has been approved by the affirmative votes, cast in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Association common stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event the shareholders of the Association approve the plan of reorganization under subsection (b) of this section, the following provisions shall apply beginning on the reorganization effective date:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as specifically provided in this section, until the dissolution date the Association shall continue to have all of the rights, privileges and obligations set forth in, and shall be subject to all of the limitations and restrictions of, section 1087&ndash;2 of this title, and the Association shall continue to carry out the purposes of such section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association) shall not be entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and obligations, and shall not be subject to the <!-- PDFPage:404 -->limitations and restrictions, applicable to the Association under section 1087&ndash;2 of this title, except as specifically provided in this section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association or a subsidiary of the Association) shall not purchase loans insured under this chapter until such time as the Association ceases acquiring such loans, except that the Holding Company may purchase such loans if the Association is merely continuing to acquire loans as a lender of last resort pursuant to section 1087&ndash;2(q) of this title or under an agreement with the Secretary described in paragraph (6).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfer of certain property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) licenses and other intellectual property of the Association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) any other property of the Association.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Transfer of personnel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On the reorganization effective date, employees of the Association shall become employees of the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding Company), and the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding Company) shall provide all necessary and appropriate management and operational support (including loan servicing) to the Association, as requested by the Association. The Association, however, may obtain such management and operational support from persons or entities not associated with the Holding Company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Association may pay dividends in the form of cash or noncash distributions so long as at the time of the declaration of such dividends, after giving effect to the payment of such dividends as of the date of such declaration by the Board of Directors of the Association, the Association's capital would be in compliance with the capital standards and requirements set forth in section 1087&ndash;2(r) of this title. If, at any time after the reorganization effective date, the Association fails to comply with such capital standards, the Holding Company shall transfer with due diligence to the Association additional capital in such amounts as are necessary to ensure that the Association again complies with the capital standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Certification prior to dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Prior to the payment of any dividend under paragraph (4), the Association shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that the payment of the dividend will be made in compliance with paragraph (4) and shall provide copies of all calculations needed to make such certification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Restrictions on new business activity or acquisition of assets by Association</h4>
