<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Institutions outside the United States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of qualifying as an institution under paragraph (1)(C), the Secretary shall establish criteria by regulation for the approval of institutions outside the United States and for the determination that such institutions are comparable to an institution of higher education as defined in section 1001 of this title. In the case of a graduate medical or veterinary school outside the United States, such criteria shall include a requirement that a student attending such school outside the United States is ineligible for loans made, insured, or guaranteed under part B&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1002_1_target" name="1002_1">1</a></sup> unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i)(I) at least 60 percent of those enrolled in, and at least 60 percent of the graduates of, the graduate medical school outside the United States were not persons described in section 1091(a)(5) of this title in the year preceding the year for which a student is seeking a loan under part B of subchapter IV of this chapter; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that, in an effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on college campuses, all institutions of higher education should carry out the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The president of the institution should appoint a task force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students, Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full examination of student and academic life at the institution. The task force should make recommendations for a broad range of policy and program changes that would serve to reduce alcohol and other drug-related problems. The institution should provide resources to assist the task force in promoting the campus policies and proposed environmental changes that have been identified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The institution should enforce a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by students at the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The institution should vigorously enforce the institution's code of disciplinary sanctions for those who violate campus alcohol policies. Students with alcohol or other drug-related problems should be referred for assistance, including on-campus counseling programs if appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The institution should adopt a policy to discourage alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus activities. It should adopt policies limiting the advertisement and promotion of alcoholic beverages on campus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The institution should work with the local community, including local businesses, in a &ldquo;Town/Gown&rdquo; alliance to encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and to address illegal alcohol use by students.</p>
