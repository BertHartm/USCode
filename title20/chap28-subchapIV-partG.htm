The Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, establish criteria for such determinations. Such criteria shall include an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement. Such criteria shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the accrediting agency or association shall be a State, regional, or national agency or association and shall demonstrate the ability and the experience to operate as an accrediting agency or association within the State, region, or nationally, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such agency or association&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) for the purpose of participation in programs under this chapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, has a voluntary membership of institutions of higher education and has as a principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher education; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is an agency or association that, for the purpose of determining eligibility for student assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, conducts accreditation through (i) a voluntary membership organization of individuals participating in a profession, or (ii) an agency or association which has as its principal purpose the accreditation of programs within institutions, which institutions are accredited by another agency or association recognized by the Secretary;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if such agency or association is an agency or association described in&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2), then such agency or association has been recognized by the Secretary on or before October 1, 1991; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) and such agency or association has been recognized by the Secretary on or before October 1, 1991, then the Secretary may waive the requirement that such agency or association is separate and independent, both administratively and financially of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization upon a demonstration that the existing relationship has not served to compromise the independence of its accreditation process;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) such agency or association consistently applies and enforces standards that respect the stated mission of the institution of higher education, including religious missions, and that ensure that the courses or programs of instruction, training, or study offered by the institution of higher education, including distance education or correspondence courses or programs, are of sufficient quality to achieve, for the duration of the accreditation period, the stated objective for which the courses or the programs are offered; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such agency or association has or seeks to include within its scope of recognition the evaluation of the quality of institutions or programs offering distance education or correspondence education, such agency or association shall, in addition to meeting the other requirements of this subpart, demonstrate to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the agency or association's standards effectively address the quality of an institution's distance education or correspondence education in the areas identified in paragraph (5), except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the agency or association shall not be required to have separate standards, procedures, or policies for the evaluation of distance education or correspondence education institutions or programs in order to meet the requirements of this subparagraph; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the agency or association requires an institution that offers distance education or correspondence education to have processes through which the institution establishes that the student who registers in a distance education or correspondence education course or program is the same student who participates in and completes the program and receives the academic credit;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the standards for accreditation of the agency or association assess the institution's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) success with respect to student achievement in relation to the institution's mission, which may include different standards for different institutions or programs, as established by the institution, including, as appropriate, consideration of State licensing examinations, consideration of course completion, and job placement rates;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that subparagraphs (A), (H), and (J) shall not apply to agencies or associations described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such an agency or association shall establish and apply review procedures throughout the accrediting process, including evaluation and withdrawal proceedings, which comply with due process procedures that provide&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) requirements, including clear standards for an institution of higher education or program to be accredited; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) identified deficiencies at the institution or program examined;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not include current members of the agency's or association's underlying <!-- PDFPage:662 -->decisionmaking body that made the adverse decision; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is subject to a conflict of interest policy;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) in the case that the agency or association determines that the new financial information submitted by the institution or program under subparagraph (E) meets the criteria of significance and materiality described in such subparagraph, for consideration by the agency or association of the new financial information prior to the adverse action described in such subparagraph becoming final; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) that any determination by the agency or association made with respect to the new financial information described in subparagraph (E) shall not be separately appealable by the institution or program;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Dual accreditation rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is accredited, as an institution, by more than one accrediting agency or association, unless the institution submits to each such agency and association and to the Secretary the reasons for accreditation by more than one such agency or association and demonstrates to the Secretary reasonable cause for its accreditation by more than one agency or association. If the institution is accredited, as an institution, by more than one accrediting agency or association, the institution shall designate which agency's accreditation shall be utilized in determining the institution's eligibility for programs under this chapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Impact of loss of accreditation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is related to the religious mission or affiliation of the institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not related to the accreditation criteria provided for in this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the agency or association fails to bring the agency or association into compliance within such timeframe, the Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, limit, suspend, or terminate the recognition of the agency or association.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may determine that an accrediting agency or association has failed to apply effectively the standards provided in this section if an institution of higher education seeks and receives accreditation from the accrediting agency or association during any period in which the institution is the subject of any interim action by another accrediting agency or association, described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (2)(B), or (2)(C) of subsection (a) of this section, leading to the suspension, revocation, or termination of accreditation or the institution has been notified of the threatened loss of accreditation, and the due process procedures required by such suspension, revocation, termination, or threatened loss have not been completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Limitation on Secretary's authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may only recognize accrediting agencies or associations which accredit institutions of higher education for the purpose of enabling such institutions to establish eligibility to participate in the programs under this chapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 or which accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling them to establish eligibility to participate in other programs administered by the Department of Education or other Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Independent evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of the performance of all accrediting agencies or associations which seek recognition by the Secretary in order to determine whether such accrediting agencies or associations meet the criteria established by this section. The Secretary shall conduct an independent evaluation of the information provided by such agency or association. Such evaluation shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the solicitation of third-party information concerning the performance of the accrediting agency or association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) site visits, including unannounced site visits as appropriate, at accrediting agencies and associations, and, at the Secretary's discretion, at representative member institutions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall place a priority for review of accrediting agencies or associations on those agencies or associations that accredit institutions of higher education that participate most extensively in the programs authorized by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and on those agencies or associations which have been the subject of the most complaints or legal actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall consider all available relevant information concerning the compliance of the accrediting agency or association with the criteria provided for in this section, including any complaints or legal actions against such agency or association. In cases where deficiencies in the performance of an accreditation agency or association with respect to the requirements of this section are noted, the Secretary shall take these deficiencies into account in the recognition process. The Secretary shall not, under any circumstances, base decisions on the recognition or denial of recognition of accreditation agencies or associations on criteria other than those contained in this section. When the Secretary decides to recognize an accrediting agency or association, the Secretary shall determine the agency or association's scope of recognition. If the agency or association reviews institutions offering distance education courses or programs and the Secretary determines that the agency or association meets the requirements of this section, then the agency shall be recognized and the scope of recognition shall include accreditation of institutions offering distance education courses or programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall maintain sufficient documentation to support the conclusions reached in the recognition process, and, if the Secretary does not recognize any accreditation agency or association, shall make publicly available the reason for denying recognition, including reference to the specific criteria under this section which have not been fulfilled.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall by regulation provide procedures for the recognition of accrediting agencies or associations and for the appeal of the Secretary's decisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall not promulgate any regulation with respect to the standards of an accreditation agency or association described in subsection (a)(5).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in subsection (a)(5) shall be construed to restrict the ability of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an accrediting agency or association to set, with the involvement of its members, and to apply, accreditation standards for or to institutions or programs that seek review by the agency or association; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an institution to develop and use institutional standards to show its success with respect to student achievement, which achievement may be considered as part of any accreditation review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Review of scope changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require a review, at the next available meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, of any change in scope undertaken by an agency or association under subsection (a)(4)(B)(i)(II) if the enrollment of an institution that offers distance education or correspondence education that is accredited by such agency or association increases by 50 percent or more within any one institutional fiscal year.</p>
