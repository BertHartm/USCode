<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subpart is to establish and implement a model partnership between a governmental entity and a private entity, to help prepare young children for reading and to motivate older children to read, through the distribution of inexpensive books. Local reading motivation programs assisted under this section shall use such assistance to provide books, training for volunteers, motivational activities, and other essential literacy resources and shall assign the highest priority to serving the youngest and neediest children in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to enter into a contract with Reading Is Fundamental (RIF) (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;contractor&rdquo;) to support and promote programs, which include the distribution of inexpensive books to young and school-age children, that motivate children to read.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract entered into under subsection (b) of this section shall contain each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A provision that the contractor will enter into subcontracts with local private nonprofit groups or organizations, or with public agencies, under which each subcontractor will agree to establish, operate, and provide the non-Federal share of the cost of reading motivation programs that include the distribution of books, by gift (to the extent feasible) or by loan, to children from birth through secondary school age, including children in family literacy programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A provision that funds made available to subcontractors will be used only to pay the Federal share of the cost of such programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A provision that, in selecting subcontractors for initial funding, the contractor will give priority to programs that will serve a substantial number or percentage of children with special needs, such as the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Low-income children, particularly in high-poverty areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Children at risk of school failure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Institutionalized or incarcerated children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Children whose parents are institutionalized or incarcerated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A provision that the contractor will provide such training and technical assistance to subcontractors as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of this subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A provision that the contractor will annually report to the Secretary the number, and a description, of programs funded under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Such other terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure the effectiveness of such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restriction on payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make no payment of the Federal share of the cost of acquiring and distributing books under any contract under this section unless the Secretary determines that the contractor or subcontractor, as the case may be, has made arrangements with book publishers or distributors to obtain books at discounts at least as favorable as discounts that are customarily given by such publisher or distributor for book purchases made under similar circumstances in the absence of Federal assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rules for certain subcontractors</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Funds from other Federal sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subcontractors operating programs under this section in low-income communities with a substantial number or percentage of children with special needs, as described in subsection (c)(3) of this section, may use funds from other <!-- PDFPage:1225 -->Federal sources to pay the non-Federal share of the cost of the program, if those funds do not comprise more than 50 percent of the non-Federal share of the funds used for the cost of acquiring and distributing books.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waiver authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, the contractor may waive, in whole or in part, the requirement in subsection (c)(1) of this section for a subcontractor, if the subcontractor demonstrates that it would otherwise not be able to participate in the program, and enters into an agreement with the contractor with respect to the amount of the non-Federal share to which the waiver will apply. In a case in which such a waiver is granted, the requirement in subsection (c)(2) of this section shall not apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Multi-year contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The contractor may enter into a multi-year subcontract under this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contractor believes that such subcontract will provide the subcontractor with additional leverage in seeking local commitments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the subcontract does not undermine the finances of the national program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Federal share defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;Federal share&rdquo; means, with respect to the cost to a subcontractor of purchasing books to be paid for under this section, 75 percent of such costs to the subcontractor, except that the Federal share for programs serving children of migrant or seasonal farmworkers shall be 100 percent of such costs to the subcontractor.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians have been linked for over 200 years to the coastal towns of Salem, Massachusetts, and New Bedford, Massachusetts, through the China trade from Salem and whaling voyages from New Bedford.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Nineteenth-century trading ships sailed from Salem, Massachusetts, around Cape Horn of South America, and up the Northwest coast of the United States to Alaska, where their crews traded with Alaska Native people for furs, and then went on to Hawaii to trade for sandalwood with Native Hawaiians before going on to China.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) During the 19th century, over 2,000 whaling voyages sailed out of New Bedford, Massachusetts to the Arctic region of Alaska, and joined Alaska Natives from Barrow, Alaska and other areas in the Arctic region in subsistence whaling activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Many New Bedford whaling voyages continued on to Hawaii, where they joined Native Hawaiians from the neighboring islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) From those commercial and whaling voyages, a rich cultural exchange and strong trading relationships developed among the three peoples involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In the past decades, awareness of the historical trading, cultural, and whaling links has faded among Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and the people of the continental United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In 2000, the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Alaska, the Bishop Museum in Hawaii, and the Peabody-Essex Museum in Massachusetts initiated the New Trade Winds project to use 21st-century technology, including the Internet, to educate students and their parents about historic and contemporary cultural and trading ties that continue to link the diverse cultures of the peoples involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The New Bedford Whaling Museum, in partnership with the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park, has developed a cultural exchange and educational program with the Inupiat Heritage Center in Barrow, Alaska to bring together the children, parents, and elders from the Arctic region of Alaska with children and families of Massachusetts to learn about their historical ties and about each other's contemporary cultures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Within the fast-growing cultural sector, meaningful educational and career opportunities based on traditional relationships exist for Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and low-income youth in Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Cultural institutions can provide practical, culturally relevant, education-related internship and apprentice programs, such as the Museum Action Corps at the Peabody-Essex Museum and similar programs at the New Bedford Oceanarium and other institutions, to prepare youths and their families for careers in the cultural sector.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The resources of the institutions described in paragraphs (7) and (8) provide unique opportunities for illustrating and in<!-- PDFPage:1237 -->terpreting the contributions of Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, the whaling industry, and the China trade to the economic, social, and environmental history of the United States, for educating students and their parents, and for providing opportunities for internships and apprenticeships leading to careers with cultural institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subpart are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To authorize and develop innovative culturally-based educational programs and cultural exchanges to assist Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and children and families of Massachusetts linked by history and tradition to Alaska and Hawaii to learn about shared culture and traditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To authorize and develop internship and apprentice programs to assist Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and children and families of Massachusetts linked by history and tradition with Alaska and Hawaii to prepare for careers with cultural institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To supplement programs and authorities in the area of education to further the objectives of this subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To authorize and develop cultural and educational programs relating to any Federally recognized Indian tribe in Mississippi.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) since the enactment of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], women and girls have made strides in educational achievement and in their ability to avail themselves of educational opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of funding provided under the Women's Educational Equity Act of 2001 [20 U.S.C. 7283 et seq.], more curricula, training, and other educational materials concerning educational equity for women and girls are available for national dissemination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) teaching and learning practices in the United States are frequently inequitable as such practices relate to women and girls, for example&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sexual harassment, particularly that experienced by girls, undermines the ability of schools to provide a safe and equitable learning or workplace environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) classroom textbooks and other educational materials do not sufficiently reflect the experiences, achievements, or concerns of women and, in most cases, are not written by women or persons of color;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) girls do not take as many mathematics and science courses as boys, girls lose confidence in their mathematics and science ability as girls move through adolescence, and there are few women role models in the sciences; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) pregnant and parenting teenagers are at high risk for dropping out of school and existing dropout prevention programs do not adequately address the needs of such teenagers;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) efforts to improve the quality of public education also must include efforts to ensure equal access to quality education programs for all women and girls;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Federal support should address not only research and development of innovative model curricula and teaching and learning strategies to promote gender equity, but should also assist schools and local communities implement gender equitable practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Federal assistance for gender equity must be tied to systemic reform, involve collaborative efforts to implement effective gender practices at the local level, and encourage parental participation; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1250 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) excellence in education, high educational achievements and standards, and the full participation of women and girls in American society, cannot be achieved without educational equity for women and girls.</p>
