The letter designation was changed from &ldquo;D&rdquo; to &ldquo;C&rdquo; for codification purposes. Part C of title IV of Pub. L. 89&ndash;329, consisting of sections 441 to 447, as added by Pub. L. 99&ndash;498, title IV, &sect;403(a), Oct. 17, 1986, 100 Stat. 1429, is set out as section 2751 et seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, because sections 441 to 446 of Pub. L. 89&ndash;329 had originally been enacted as part C of title I of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, consisting of sections 121 to 126 of Pub.
