<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall use funds received under this part only in eligible school attendance areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible school attendance areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the term &ldquo;school attendance area&rdquo; means, in relation to a particular school, the geographical area in which the children who are normally served by that school reside; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the term &ldquo;eligible school attendance area&rdquo; means a school attendance area in which the percentage of children from low-income families is at least as high as the percentage of children from low-income families in the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Ranking order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds allocated in accordance with subsection (c) of this section are insufficient to serve all eligible school attendance areas, a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank, without regard to grade spans, such agency's eligible school attendance areas in which the concentration of children from low-income families exceeds 75 percent from highest to lowest according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Remaining funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds remain after serving all eligible school attendance areas under paragraph (3), a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank such agency's remaining eligible school attendance areas from highest to lowest either by grade span or for the entire local educational agency according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order either within each grade-span grouping or within the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agency shall use the same measure of poverty, which measure shall be the number of children ages 5 through 17 in poverty counted in the most recent census data approved by the Secretary, the number of children eligible for free and reduced priced lunches under the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], the number of children in families receiving assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, or the number of children eligible to receive medical assistance under the Medicaid program, or a composite of such indicators, with respect to all school attendance areas in the local educational agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to identify eligible school attendance areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to determine the ranking of each area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to determine allocations under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to a local educational agency with a total enrollment of less than 1,000 children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver for desegregation plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a local educational agency's written request for a waiver of the requirements of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, and permit such agency to treat as eligible, and serve, any school that children attend with a State-ordered or a <!-- PDFPage:1154 -->court-ordered school desegregation plan or a plan that continues to be implemented in accordance with a State-ordered or court-ordered desegregation plan, if (A) the number of economically disadvantaged children enrolled in the school is at least 25 percent of the school's total enrollment; and (B) the Secretary determines on the basis of a written request from such agency and in accordance with such criteria as the Secretary establishes, that approval of that request would further the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Local educational agency discretion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, a local educational agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designate as eligible any school attendance area or school in which at least 35 percent of the children are from low-income families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) use funds received under this part in a school that is not in an eligible school attendance area, if the percentage of children from low-income families enrolled in the school is equal to or greater than the percentage of such children in a participating school attendance area of such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) elect not to serve an eligible school attendance area or eligible school that has a higher percentage of children from low-income families if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the school meets the comparability requirements of section 6322(c) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the school is receiving supplemental funds from other State or local sources that are spent according to the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the funds expended from such other sources equal or exceed the amount that would be provided under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(C), the number of children attending private elementary and secondary schools who are to receive services, and the assistance such children are to receive under this part, shall be determined without regard to whether the public school attendance area in which such children reside is assisted under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall allocate funds received under this part to eligible school attendance areas or eligible schools, identified under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, in rank order, on the basis of the total number of children from low-income families in each area or school.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the per pupil amount of funds allocated to each school attendance area or school under paragraph (1) shall be at least 125 percent of the per pupil amount of funds a local educational agency received for that year under the poverty criteria described by the local educational agency in the plan submitted under section 6312 of this title, except that this paragraph shall not apply to a local educational agency that only serves schools in which the percentage of such children is 35 percent or greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A local educational agency may reduce the amount of funds allocated under subparagraph (A) for a school attendance area or school by the amount of any supplemental State and local funds expended in that school attendance area or school for programs that meet the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall reserve such funds as are necessary under this part to provide services comparable to those provided to children in schools funded under this part to serve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) where appropriate, eligible homeless children who do not attend participating schools, including providing educationally related support services to children in shelters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) children in local institutions for neglected or delinquent children; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) use any additional measures or indicators described in the local educational agency's plan to review annually the progress of each school served under this part to determine whether the school is meeting, or making adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(i) of this title toward enabling its students to meet the State's student performance standards described in the State plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) publicize and disseminate to teachers and other staff, parents, students, and the community, the results of the annual review under paragraph (2) of all schools served under this part in individual school performance profiles that include statistically sound disaggregated results as required by section 6311(b)(3)(I) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide the results of the local annual review to schools so that the schools can continually refine the program of instruction to help all children served under this part in those schools meet the State's student performance standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation of distinguished schools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State educational agency and local educational agency receiving funds under this part shall designate distinguished schools in accordance with section 6318 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) School improvement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall identify for school improvement any school served under this part that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has been in program improvement under section 1020 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994), for at least two consecutive school years prior to such day;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each school identified under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in consultation with parents, the local educational agency, and the school support team, develop or revise a school plan in ways that have the greatest likelihood of improving the performance of participating children in meeting the State's student performance standards, which may include reviewing the schools&rsquo; plan in the context of the <!-- PDFPage:1160 -->opportunity-to-learn standards or strategies developed by such State under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) submit the plan or revised plan to the local educational agency for approval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before identifying a school for school improvement under paragraph (1), the local educational agency shall provide the school with an opportunity to review the school-level data, including assessment data, on which such identification is based. If the school believes that such identification for school improvement is in error for statistical or other substantive reasons, such school may provide evidence to the local educational agency to support such belief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) During the first year immediately following such identification, the school shall implement such school's plan or revised plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Professional development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each school identified under paragraph (1) shall, as part of the school plan under paragraph (2), improve the skills of its staff by providing effective professional development activities. A school shall demonstrate such school's compliance with this paragraph by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) otherwise demonstrating that such school is effectively carrying out professional development activities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A school may use funds from any source to meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Decisions about how to use the funds made available under this part which the school makes available for professional development shall be made by teachers, principals, and other school staff in that school.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Technical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For each school identified under paragraph (1), the local educational agency shall provide technical or other assistance as the school develops and implements such school's plan or revised plan, such as a joint plan between the local educational agency and school that addresses specific elements of student performance problems and that specifies school and local educational agency responsibilities under the plan, and waivers or modifications of requirements of local educational agency policy or regulation that impede the ability of the school to educate students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such technical assistance may be provided directly by the local educational agency, through mechanisms authorized under section 6318 of this title, or with the local educational agency's approval, by an institution of higher education, a private nonprofit organization, an educational service agency, a comprehensive regional assistance center under part A of subchapter XIII of this chapter, or other entities with experience in helping schools improve achievement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Corrective action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), after providing technical assistance pursuant to paragraph (4) and taking other remediation measures, the local educational agency may take corrective action at any time against a school that has been identified under paragraph (1), but, during the third year following identification under paragraph (1), shall take such action against any school that still fails to make adequate progress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Corrective actions are those, consistent with State and local law, determined and made public and disseminated by the local educational agency, which may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) withholding funds;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) has failed to meet the criteria established by the State through such State's transitional procedure under section 6311(b)(7)(B) of this title for two consecutive years.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Local educational agency revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each local educational agency identified under paragraph (3) shall, in consultation with schools, parents, and educational experts, revise its local educational agency plan under section 6312 of this title in ways that have the greatest likelihood of improving the performance of schools served by the local educational agency under this part in meeting the State's student performance standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) States shall use funds reserved under section 6303(a) of this title and funds made available under section 6302(f) of this title to allow schools identified under this paragraph to carry out the activities described in subparagraph (B) and may use such funds to provide awards to such schools to further such school's education programs under this part, provide additional incentives for continued success, and reward individuals or groups in the school for exemplary performance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to implement this section funds reserved under section 6303(a) of this title and funds made available under section 6302(f) of this title may be used by a State for release time for teachers and administrators, travel, training, and other related costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Alternatives</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount of grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grants for local educational agencies and Puerto Rico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The grant which a local educational agency in a State is eligible to receive under this subpart for a fiscal year shall (except as provided in section 6337 of this title), be determined by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section by 40 percent of the amount determined under the next sentence. The amount determined under this sentence shall be the average per pupil expenditure in the State except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the average per pupil expenditure in the State is less than 80 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States, such amount shall be 80 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the average per pupil expenditure in the State is more than 120 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States, such amount shall be 120 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basis for calculating grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal years 1995 through 1998, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority during any particular fiscal year to make the allocations under this part (other than section 6334 of this title) directly to local educational agencies without regard to the counties. If the Secretary approves an application of a State educational agency for a particular year under this subparagraph, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such allocations will be made using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such allocations will be made using alternative data approved by the Secretary that the State determines best reflects the distribution of children in poor families and is adjusted to be equivalent in proportion to the number of children determined in accordance with subsection (c) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such allocations will be made using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In addition, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that a procedure will be established through which local educational agencies dissatisfied with the determinations made by the State educational agency may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination. Beginning in fiscal year 1999, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of population data compiled for local educational agencies, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable taking into consideration the recommendations of the study to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data referred to in this paragraph are inappropriate or unreliable, the Secretaries shall jointly issue a report setting forth their reasons in detail. In years when grants are calculated by the Secretary on the basis of local educational agency data, for each local educational agency serving an area with a total population of at least 20,000 persons, the grant under this section shall be the amount determined by the Secretary. For local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons, the State educational agency may either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) distribute to such local educational agencies grants under this section equal to the amounts determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) use an alternative method, approved by the Secretary, to distribute the share of the State's total grants under this section that is based on local educational agencies with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. Such an alternative method of distributing grants under this section among a State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons shall be based upon population data that the State educational agency determines best reflect the current distribution of children in poor families among the State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. If a local educational agency serving an area with total population of less than 20,000 persons is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State education agency, then such local educational agency may appeal this determination to the Secretary. The Secretary must respond to this appeal within 45 days of receipt.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Puerto Rico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the percentage which the average per pupil expenditure in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is of the lowest average per pupil expenditure of any of the 50 States. The grant which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be eligible to receive under this section for a fiscal year shall be the amount arrived at by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage determined under the preceding sentence; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1173 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 32 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) &ldquo;State&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum number of children to qualify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the succeeding sentence, a local educational agency shall be eligible for a basic grant for a fiscal year under this subpart only if the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section in the school district of such local educational agency is at least 10. Beginning in fiscal year 1996, no local educational agency shall be eligible for a grant under this section if the number of children counted for grants under this section is equal to 2 percent or less of the total school age population in the local educational agency. For fiscal years 1996 through 1998, grants not made as a result of applying the preceding sentence shall be reallocated by the State educational agency to other eligible local educational agencies in the State in proportion to the distribution of other funds under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Children to be counted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Categories of children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The number of children to be counted for purposes of this section is the aggregate of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of the local educational agency from families below the poverty level as determined under paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency from families above the poverty level as determined under paragraph (5); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency in institutions for neglected and delinquent children (other than such institutions operated by the United States), but not counted pursuant to subpart 1 of part D of this subchapter for the purposes of a grant to a State agency, or being supported in foster homes with public funds.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of number of children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data, described in paragraph (3), available from the Department of Commerce. For fiscal year 1999 and beyond, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be treated as individual local educational agencies. If a local educational agency contains two or more counties in their entirety, then each county will be treated as if such county were a separate local educational agency for purposes of calculating grants under this part. The total of grants for such counties shall be allocated to such a local educational agency, which local educational agency shall distribute to schools in each county within such agency a share of the local educational agency's total grant that is no less than the county's share of the population counts used to calculate the local educational agency's grant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Population updates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In fiscal year 1997 and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary shall use updated data on the number of children, aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level for counties or local educational agencies, published by the Department of Commerce, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable, taking into consideration the recommendations of the study to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data referred to in this paragraph are inappropriate or unreliable, they shall jointly issue a report setting forth their reasons in detail. In determining the families which are below the poverty level, the Secretary shall utilize the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census, in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Education shall, within 30 days after October 20, 1994, contract with the National Academy of Sciences (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Academy&rdquo;) to study the program to produce intercensal poverty data for small geographic areas and certain age cohorts being developed by the Bureau of the Census.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In conducting its study, the Academy shall consider such matters as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the methodology used to produce and publish intercensal poverty data, and possible alternative methods to improve the usefulness of the data for Federal program purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the availability of alternative indicators of poverty for small geographic areas, against which the poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census could be compared;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the reliability of the poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census, particularly for less populous geographic areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the reliability of intercensal poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census, as compared over time to similar data produced by the Bureau of the Census during the most recent decennial census; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) the usefulness of poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census for Federal programs that allocate funds to State and sub-State areas based, in whole or in part, on such data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Academy shall submit to the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce, as well as to the Committee on Education and Labor <!-- PDFPage:1174 -->and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) not later than 18 months after the date on which a contract is entered into under subsection (a) of this section, and not later than every 18 months thereafter, such interim reports on the Academy's activities under this chapter that the Academy deems appropriate, including a detailed statement of the Academy's findings and conclusions with respect to any poverty data which the Bureau of the Census publishes and produces, within 90 days of such publication; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not later than December 31, 1998, a final report which shall include a more detailed statement of the Academy's findings and conclusions with respect to the use of any intercensal poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census as the basis for allocating Federal funds under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Of the funds appropriated under section 6302(f) of this title, the Secretary shall use such sums as are necessary in each of fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 to carry out the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Other children to be counted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families above the poverty level on the basis of the number of such children from families receiving an annual income, in excess of the current criteria of poverty, from payments under the program of aid to families with dependent children under a State plan approved under title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]; and in making such determinations the Secretary shall utilize the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census for a family of 4 in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Secretary shall determine the number of such children and the number of children of such ages living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, or being supported in foster homes with public funds, on the basis of the caseload data for the month of October of the preceding fiscal year (using, in the case of children described in the preceding sentence, the criteria of poverty and the form of such criteria required by such sentence which were determined for the calendar year preceding such month of October) or, to the extent that such data are not available to the Secretary before January of the calendar year in which the Secretary's determination is made, then on the basis of the most recent reliable data available to the Secretary at the time of such determination. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall collect and transmit the information required by this subparagraph to the Secretary not later than January 1 of each year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Estimate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When requested by the Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce shall make a special updated estimate of the number of children of such ages who are from families below the poverty level (as determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6333_1_target" name="6333_1">1</a></sup>) in each school district, and the Secretary is authorized to pay (either in advance or by way of reimbursement) the Secretary of Commerce the cost of making this special estimate. The Secretary of Commerce shall give consideration to any request of the chief executive of a State for the collection of additional census information. For purposes of this section, the Secretary shall consider all children who are in correctional institutions to be living in institutions for delinquent children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State minimum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1) or (d) of section 6332 of this title, the aggregate amount allotted for all local educational agencies within a State may not be less than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 0.25 percent of total grants under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) one-quarter of 1 percent of the total amount available for such fiscal year under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of children in such State counted under subsection (c) of this section in the fiscal year multiplied by 150 percent of the national average per pupil payment made with funds available under this section for that year.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligibility for and amount of grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, each local educational agency, in a State other than Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau, which is eligible for a grant under this part for any fiscal year shall be eligible for an additional grant under this section for that fiscal year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title in the county (for fiscal years 1996 through 1998), or local educational agency (for fiscal years beginning with 1999) for the fiscal year exceeds 6,500; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title exceeds 15 percent of the total number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the county (for fiscal years 1996 through 1998), or local educational agency (for fiscal years beginning with 1999) in that fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding such subsections (b)(1) and (d) of section 6332 of this title, no State described in subparagraph (A) shall receive less than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 0.25 percent of total grants; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the average of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) one-quarter of 1 percent of the sums available to carry out this section for such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) $340,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) the number of children in such State counted for purposes of this section in that fiscal year multiplied by 150 percent of the national average per pupil payment made with funds available under this section for that year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each county or local educational agency eligible to receive an additional grant under this section for any fiscal year the Secretary shall determine the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title for that fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the quotient resulting from the division of the amount determined for those agencies under section 6333(a)(1) of this title for the fiscal year for which the determination is being made divided by the total number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title for that agency for fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the additional grant for which an eligible local educational agency or county is eligible under this section for any fiscal year shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount available to carry out this section for that fiscal year as the product determined under paragraph (2) for such local educational agency for that fiscal year bears to the sum of such products for all local educational agencies in the United States for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Suballocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal years 1996 through 1998, county amounts shall be suballocated to local educational agencies meeting the criteria of paragraph (1)(A) by State educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. For fiscal years 1995 through 1998, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority during any particular fiscal year to make the allocations under this part (other than this section) directly to local educational agencies without regard to the counties. If the Secretary approves an application of a State educational agency for a particular year under this paragraph, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such allocations will be made using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such allocations will be made using alternative data approved by the Secretary that the State determines best reflects the distribution of children in poor families and is adjusted to be equivalent in proportion to the number of children determined in accordance with section 6333(c) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such allocations will be made using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In addition, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that a procedure will be established through which local educational agencies dissatisfied with the determinations made by the State educational agency may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination. A State may reserve not more than 2 percent of its allocations in fiscal years 1996 through 1998 under this section for the purpose of making grants to local educational agencies that meet the criteria of clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A), but are in ineligible counties. For fiscal years beginning with 1999, for each local educational agency serving an area with a total population of at least 20,000 persons, the grant under this section shall be the amount determined by the Secretary. For local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons, the State educational agency may either (i) distribute to such local educational agencies grants under this section equal to the amounts determined by the Secretary; or (ii) use an alternative method, approved by the Secretary, to distribute the share of the State's total grants under this section that is based on local educational agencies with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. Such an alternative method of distributing grants under this section among a State's local educational agencies serving <!-- PDFPage:1176 -->areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons shall be based upon population data that the State educational agency determines best reflects the current distribution of children in poor families among the State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons and meeting the eligibility criteria of paragraph (1)(A). If a local educational agency serving an area with total population of less than 20,000 persons is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State educational agency, then such local educational agency may appeal this determination to the Secretary. The Secretary shall respond to this appeal within 45 days of receipt. The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Commerce regarding whether available data on population for local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons are sufficiently reliable to be used to determine final grants to such areas meeting the eligibility criteria of paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reservation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the total amount of funds available for this section and sections 6333 and 6335 of this title, an amount equal to the appropriation for fiscal year 1995 for section 1006 of this Act (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) shall be available to carry out this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Ratable reduction rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the sums available under subsection (b) of this section for any fiscal year for making payments under this section are not sufficient to pay in full the total amounts which all States are eligible to receive under subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year, the maximum amounts which all States are eligible to receive under subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year shall be ratably reduced. In the case that additional funds become available for making such payments for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence is applicable, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) States receiving minimum grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In States that receive the minimum grant under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the State educational agency shall allocate such funds among the local educational agencies in each State either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (4) of subsection (a) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) based on their respective concentrations and numbers of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title, except that only those local educational agencies with concentrations or numbers of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title that exceed the statewide average percentage of such children or the statewide average number of such children shall receive any funds on the basis of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the number of such children between 1,871 and 6,910, inclusive, in such population, multiplied by 2.0;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) the number of such children in excess of 42,000 in such population, multiplied by 3.0.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Puerto Rico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the weighting factor for Puerto Rico under this paragraph shall not be greater than the total number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title multiplied by 1.72.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Local educational agency allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For fiscal years 1995 through 1998, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of the number of children counted under section 6333 of this title for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority during any particular fiscal year to make the allocations under this part (other than section 6334 of this title) directly to local educational agencies without regard to the counties. If the Secretary approves an application of a State educational agency for a particular year under this subparagraph, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such allocations will be made using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such allocations will be made using alternative data approved by the Secretary that the State determines best reflects the dis<!-- PDFPage:1178 -->tribution of children in poor families and is adjusted to be equivalent in proportion to the number of children determined in accordance with section 6333(c) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such allocations will be made using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that a procedure will be established through which local educational agencies dissatisfied with the determinations made by the State educational agency may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination. For fiscal years beginning in 1999, for each local educational agency serving an area with a total population of at least 20,000 persons, the grant under this section shall be the amount determined by the Secretary. For local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons, the State educational agency may either (1) distribute to such local educational agencies grants under this section equal to the amounts determined by the Secretary; or (2) use an alternative method, approved by the Secretary, to distribute the share of the State's total grants under this section that is based on local educational agencies with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. Such an alternative method of distributing grants under this section among a State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons shall be based upon population data that the State educational agency determines best reflects the current distribution of children in poor families among the State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. If a local educational agency serving an area with total populations of less than 20,000 persons is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State educational agency, then the local educational agency may appeal this determination to the Secretary. The Secretary shall respond to this appeal within 45 days of receipt.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State minimum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or subsection (b)(1) or (d) of section 6332 of this title, from the total amount available for any fiscal year to carry out this section, each State shall be allotted at least the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 0.25 percent of total appropriations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to make grants to States from the sums appropriated pursuant to subsection (e) of this section to carry out the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distribution based upon fiscal effort and equity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds appropriated pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be allotted to each State based upon the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, of such State multiplied by the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such State's effort factor described in paragraph (2); multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 1.30 minus such State's equity factor described in paragraph (3),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that for each fiscal year no State shall receive less than one-quarter of 1 percent of the total amount appropriated pursuant to subsection (e) of this section for such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effort factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the effort factor for a State shall be determined in accordance with the succeeding sentence, except that such factor shall not be less than .95 nor greater than 1.05. The effort factor determined under this sentence shall be a fraction the numerator of which is the product of the three-year average per-pupil expenditure in the State multiplied by the three-year average per capita income in the United States and the denominator of which is the product of the three-year average per capita income in such State multiplied by the three-year average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The effort factor for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be equal to the lowest effort factor calculated under subparagraph (A) for any State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Equity factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall determine the equity factor under this section for each State in accordance with clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii)(I) For each State, the Secretary shall compute a weighted coefficient of variation for the per-pupil expenditures of local educational agencies in accordance with subclauses (II), (III), (IV), and (V).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) In computing coefficients of variation, the Secretary shall weigh the variation between per-pupil expenditures in each local educational agency and the average per-pupil expenditures in the State according to the number of pupils in the local educational agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) In determining the number of pupils under this paragraph in each local educational agency and each State, the Secretary shall multiply the number of children from low-income families by 1.4 under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) In computing coefficients of variation, the Secretary shall include only those local <!-- PDFPage:1179 -->educational agencies with an enrollment of more than 200 students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) The Secretary shall compute separate coefficients of variation for elementary, secondary, and unified local educational agencies and shall combine such coefficients into a single weighted average coefficient for the State by multiplying each coefficient by the total enrollments of the local educational agencies in each group, adding such products, and dividing such sum by the total enrollments of the local educational agencies in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The equity factor for a State that meets the disparity standard described in section 222.63 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) or a State with only one local educational agency shall be not greater than .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary may revise each State's equity factor as necessary based on the advice of independent education finance scholars to reflect other need-based costs of local educational agencies in addition to low-income student enrollment, such as differing geographic costs, costs associated with students with disabilities, children with limited-English proficiency or other meaningful educational needs, which deserve additional support. In addition and also with the advice of independent education finance scholars, the Secretary may revise each State's equity factor to incorporate other valid and accepted methods to achieve adequacy of educational opportunity that may not be reflected in a coefficient of variation method.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All funds awarded to each State under this section shall be allocated to local educational agencies and schools on a basis consistent with the distribution of other funds to such agencies and schools under sections 6333, 6334, and 6335 of this title to carry out activities under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Maintenance of effort</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a State is entitled to receive its full allotment of funds under this part for any fiscal year if the Secretary finds that either the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures within the State with respect to the provision of free public education for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made was not less than 90 percent of such combined fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduction of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reduce the amount of the of&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6336_1_target" name="6336_1">1</a></sup> funds awarded to any State under this section in any fiscal year in the exact proportion to which the State fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) by falling below 90 percent of both the fiscal effort per student and aggregate expenditures (using the measure most favorable to the State), and no such lesser amount shall be used for computing the effort required under paragraph (1) for subsequent years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Waivers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may waive, for one fiscal year only, the requirements of this subsection if the Secretary determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of making grants under this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the three succeeding fiscal years.</p>
