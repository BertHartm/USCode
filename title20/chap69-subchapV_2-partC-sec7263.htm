<p class="note-body">The Job Training Partnership Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(2)(B), is Pub. L. 97&ndash;300, Oct. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 1322, as amended, which is classified generally to chapter 19 (&sect;1501 et seq.) of Title 29, Labor. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1501 of Title 29 and Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 7264 of this title, referred to in subsec. (c)(1), was in the original &ldquo;section 5304&rdquo;, meaning section 5304 of Pub. L. 89&ndash;10, which was translated as reading section 5404 of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 89&ndash;10 does not contain a section 5304, but does contain a section 5404 relating to applications for grants under this part.</p>
