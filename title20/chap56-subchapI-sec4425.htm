<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If at any time the Institute withdraws any capital contribution (as described in subparagraph (B)(i)) made by the Institute to the trust fund referred to in subparagraph (A) or puts any property (as described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) to a use which is not for the sole benefit of the Institute, an amount equal to the value of the Federal contribution shall be withdrawn from such trust fund and returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
