<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Computation of payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b), (d), or (f) of this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of children who were in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding school year and who, while in attendance at such schools&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) resided on Federal property with a parent employed on Federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the school district of such agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) resided on Federal property with a parent who is an official of, and accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) resided on Federal property and had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined in section 101 of title 37);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) resided on Indian lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined by section 101 of title 37) but did not reside on Federal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) had a parent who is an official of, and has been accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer but did not reside on Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) resided in low-rent housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) resided on Federal property and is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) resided with a parent employed on Federal property situated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in whole or in part in the county in which such agency is located, or in whole or in part in such agency if such agency is located in more than one county; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if not in such county, in whole or in part in the same State as such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of weighted student units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b) of this sec<!-- PDFPage:1176 -->tion, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 6,500; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 1,000 or such number equals or exceeds 10 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Military installation housing undergoing renovation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of computing the amount of a payment for a local educational agency for children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i), the Secretary shall consider such children to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of Defense, that such children would have resided in housing on Federal property in accordance with paragraph (1)(B) except that such housing was undergoing renovation on the date for which the Secretary determines the number of children under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basic support payments; insufficient appropriations; State with only one local educational agency</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basic support payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at least 400 such children; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this subsection for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For any fiscal year in which the sums appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title are insufficient to pay to each local educational agency the full amount computed under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make payments in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Learning opportunity threshold payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall compute a learning opportunity threshold payment (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;threshold payment&rdquo;) by multiplying the amount obtained under paragraph (1)(C) by the total percentage obtained by adding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the percentage of federally connected children for each local educational agency determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of children described under subsection (a)(1) of this section and the denominator of which is the total number of children in average daily attendance at the schools served by such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the percentage that funds under paragraph (1)(C) represent of the total budget of the local educational agency, determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of <!-- PDFPage:1177 -->funds calculated for each local educational agency under this paragraph (not including amounts received under subsection (f) of this section), and the denominator of which is the total current expenditures for such agency in the second preceding fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Such total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 100.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For the purpose of determining the percentages described in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) that are applicable to the local educational agency providing free public education to students in grades 9 through 12 residing on Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, the Secretary shall consider only that portion of such agency's total enrollment of students in grades 9 through 12 when calculating the percentage under such subclause (I) and only that portion of the total current expenditures attributed to the operation of grades 9 through 12 in such agency when calculating the percentage under subclause (II).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Ratable distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall make payments as a ratable distribution based upon the computation made under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) States with only one local educational agency</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any of the 50 States of the United States in which there is only one local educational agency, the Secretary shall, for purposes of paragraphs (1)(B), (1)(C), and (2) of this subsection, and subsection (e) of this section, consider each administrative school district in the State to be a separate local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Computation of maximum amount of basic support payment and threshold payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In computing the maximum payment amount under paragraph (1)(C) and the learning opportunity threshold payment under paragraph (2)(B) for an administrative school district described in subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Secretary shall first determine the maximum payment amount and the total current expenditures for the State as a whole; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Secretary shall then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) proportionately allocate such maximum payment amount among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective weighted student units of such districts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) proportionately allocate such total current expenditures among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective number of students in average daily attendance at such districts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prior year data</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (f) of this section, all calculations under this section shall be based on data for each local educational agency from not later than the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the agency is making application for payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Calculations for a local educational agency that is newly established by a State shall, for the first year of operation of such agency, be based on data from the fiscal year for which the agency is making application for payment.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For fiscal year 1995 only, the Secretary shall pay, to each local educational agency that is not eligible for a payment under subsection (b) of this section but that received a payment under section 3 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) for fiscal year 1994, an amount which is not less than 85 percent of the payment such agency received under such section 3 for fiscal year 1994.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If additional funds become available for making payments under subsection (b) of this section for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under clause (i) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If additional funds become available for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under clause (i) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">From amounts appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide additional assistance to meet special circumstances relating to the provision of education in local educational agencies eligible to receive assistance under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A local educational agency is eligible to receive additional assistance under this subsection if such agency is eligible for a supplementary payment in accordance with subparagraph (B) or such agency&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) by any department or agency of the Federal Government (other than the Department) that are used for capital expenses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) If the tax rate used by the local educational agency is greater than 95 percent, but less than 100 percent, of the tax rate of comparable local educational agencies, the Secretary shall next multiply the amount determined under clause (iii) by the percentage that the tax rate of the local educational agency is of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the average tax rate of its generally comparable local educational agencies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the average tax rate of all the local educational agencies in the State in which the local educational agency is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) The Secretary shall next subtract the total amount of payments received by a local educational agency under subsections (b) and (d) of this section for a fiscal year from the amount determined under clause (iii) or clause (iv), as the case may be.</p>
