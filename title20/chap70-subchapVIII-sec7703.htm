<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Computation of payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b) or (d) of this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of children who were in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding school year and who, while in attendance at such schools&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) resided on Federal property with a parent employed on Federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the school district of such agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) resided on Federal property with a parent who is an official of, and accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) resided on Indian lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined by section 101 of title 37) but did not reside on Federal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) had a parent who is an official of, and has been accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer but did not reside on Federal property;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1330 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) resided in low-rent housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) resided on Federal property and is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) resided with a parent employed on Federal property situated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in whole or in part in the county in which such agency is located, or in whole or in part in such agency if such agency is located in more than one county; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if not in such county, in whole or in part in the same State as such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of weighted student units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 6,500; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 1,000 or such number equals or exceeds 10 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Military installation and Indian housing undergoing renovation or rebuilding</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of computing the amount of a payment for a local educational agency for children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i), the Secretary shall consider such children to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of Defense, that such children would have resided in housing on Federal property in accordance with paragraph (1)(B) except that such housing was undergoing renovation or rebuilding on the date for which the Secretary determines the number of children under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of computing the amount of a payment for a local educational agency that received a payment for children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application, the Secretary shall consider such children to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that such children would have resided in housing on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) except that such housing was undergoing renovation or rebuilding on the date for which the Secretary determines the number of children under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i)(I) Children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i) may be deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to housing on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) for a period not to exceed 3 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The number of children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i) who are deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to housing on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) for any fiscal year may not exceed the maximum number of children who are expected to occupy that housing upon completion of the renovation or rebuilding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii)(I) Children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application may be deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) with respect to housing on Indian lands undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) for a period not to exceed 3 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The number of children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application who are deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) with respect to housing on Indian lands undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) for any fiscal year may not exceed the maximum number of children who are expected to occupy that housing upon completion of the renovation or rebuilding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Military &ldquo;Build to Lease&rdquo; program housing</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of computing the amount of payment for a local educational agency for children identified under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider children residing in housing initially acquired or constructed under the former section 2828(g) of title 10 <!-- PDFPage:1331 -->(commonly known as the &ldquo;Build to Lease&rdquo; program), as added by section 801 of the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1984, to be children described under paragraph (1)(B) if the property described is within the fenced security perimeter of the military facility upon which such housing is situated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the property described in subparagraph (A) is not owned by the Federal Government, is subject to taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State, and thereby generates revenues for a local educational agency that is applying to receive a payment under this section, then the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall require the local educational agency to provide certification from an appropriate official of the Department of Defense that the property is being used to provide military housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall reduce the amount of the payment under this section by an amount equal to the amount of revenue from such taxation received in the second preceding fiscal year by such local educational agency, unless the amount of such revenue was taken into account by the State for such second preceding fiscal year and already resulted in a reduction in the amount of State aid paid to such local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basic support payments; insufficient appropriations; State with only one local educational agency</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basic support payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at least 400 such children; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located, multiplied by the local contribution percentage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If satisfactory data from the third preceding fiscal year are not available for any of the expenditures described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall use data from the most recent fiscal year for which data that are satisfactory to the Secretary are available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining the comparable local contribution rate under subparagraph (C)(iii) for a local educational agency described in section 222.39(c)(3) of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, that had its comparable local contribution rate for fiscal year 1998 calculated pursuant to section 222.39 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, the Secretary shall determine such comparable local contribution rate as the rate upon which payments under this subsection for fiscal year 2000 were made to the local educational agency adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in the per pupil expenditure in the State serving the local educational agency calculated on the basis of the second most recent preceding school year compared to the third most recent preceding school year for which school year data are available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Increase in local contribution rate due to unusual geographic factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subparagraph (C) are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency under subparagraph (C)(iii) by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, <!-- PDFPage:1332 -->of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Beginning with fiscal year 2002, for the purpose of calculating a payment under this paragraph for a local educational agency whose local contribution rate was computed under subparagraph (C)(iii) for the previous year, the Secretary shall use a local contribution rate that is not less than 95 percent of the rate that the LEA received for the preceding year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basic support payments for heavily impacted local educational agencies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible heavily impacted local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A local educational agency that receives a basic support payment under this paragraph for a fiscal year shall not be eligible to receive a basic support payment under paragraph (1) for that fiscal year.</p>
