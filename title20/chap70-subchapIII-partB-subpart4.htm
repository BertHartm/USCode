<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, of the amount appropriated for each fiscal year for this subpart, each State participating in the program assisted under this subpart shall receive an allotment equal to the proportion of the number of immigrant children and youth who are enrolled in public elementary schools or secondary schools under the jurisdiction of each local educational agency described in paragraph (2), and in nonpublic elementary schools or secondary schools within the district served by each such local educational agency within such State, relative to the total number of immigrant children and youth so enrolled in all the States participating in the program assisted under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible local educational agencies</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Determinations by the Secretary under this section for any period with respect to the number of immigrant children and youth shall be made on the basis of data or estimates provided to the Secretary by each State educational agency in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing to the affected State educational agency, that such data or estimates are clearly erroneous.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No such determination with respect to the number of immigrant children and youth shall operate because of an underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of the allotment under this section that such State would otherwise have received had such determination been made on the basis of accurate data.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1355 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallotment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fiscal year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount made available to a State from any appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with paragraph (1) shall, for purposes of this subpart, be regarded as part of such State's payment (as determined under subsection (b) of this section) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reservation of funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Agencies with a sudden influx of children and youth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Funds reserved under this paragraph and not made available under subparagraph (A) may be distributed to local educational agencies within the State that are experiencing a sudden influx of immigrant children and youth and that are otherwise not eligible for assistance under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of grant funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each local educational agency receiving a grant under paragraph (1) shall use such grant funds to carry out the activities described in section 6967 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Local educational agencies receiving funds under paragraph (1) with the highest number of immigrant children and youth may make information available on serving immigrant children and youth to local educational agencies in the State with sparse numbers of such children and youth.</p>
