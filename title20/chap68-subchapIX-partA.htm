<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Declaration of policy regarding educational opportunity</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress declares it to be the policy of the United States to provide to every individual an equal opportunity to receive an education of high quality regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, national origin, or social class. Although the American educational system has pursued this objective, it has not been attained. Inequalities of opportunity to receive high quality education remain pronounced. To achieve the goal of qual<!-- PDFPage:1050 -->ity education requires the continued pursuit of knowledge about education through research, development, improvement activities, data collection, synthesis, technical assistance, and information dissemination. While the direction of American education remains primarily the responsibility of State and local governments, the Federal Government has a clear responsibility to provide leadership in the conduct and support of scientific inquiry into the educational process.</p>
