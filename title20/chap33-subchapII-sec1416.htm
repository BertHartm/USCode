<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Standard of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State educational agency determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the requirements of this subchapter, including the targets in the State's performance plan, the State educational agency shall prohibit the local educational agency from reducing the local educational agency's maintenance of effort under section 1413(a)(2)(C) of this title for any fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the Secretary from utilizing any authority under the General Education Provisions Act [20 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.] to monitor and enforce the requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Divided State agency responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, where responsibility for ensuring that the requirements of this subchapter are met with respect to children with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons is assigned to a public agency other than the State educational agency pursuant to section 1412(a)(11)(C) of this title, the Secretary, in instances where the Secretary finds that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of this subchapter are related to a failure by the public agency, shall take appropriate corrective action to ensure compliance with this subchapter, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any reduction or withholding of payments to the State shall be proportionate to the total funds allotted under section 1411 of this title to the State as the number of eligible children with disabilities in adult prisons under the supervision of the other public agency is proportionate to the number of eligible individuals with disabilities in the State under the supervision of the State educational agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any withholding of funds under paragraph (1) shall be limited to the specific agency re<!-- PDFPage:903 -->sponsible for the failure to comply with this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Data capacity and technical assistance review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
