<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Withholding of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State educational agency involved (and to any local educational agency or State agency affected by any failure described in subparagraph (B)), finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that there has been a failure by the State to comply substantially with any provision of this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that there is a failure to comply with any condition of a local educational agency's or State agency's eligibility under this subchapter, including the terms of any agreement to achieve compliance with this subchapter within the timelines specified in the agreement;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary shall, after notifying the State educational agency, withhold, in whole or in part, any further payments to the State under this subchapter, or refer the matter for appropriate enforcement action, which may include referral to the Department of Justice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nature of withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary withholds further payments under paragraph (1), the Secretary may determine that such withholding will be limited to programs or projects, or portions thereof, affected by the failure, or that the State educational agency shall not make further payments under this subchapter to specified local educational agencies or State agencies affected by the failure. Until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any failure to comply with the provisions of this subchapter, as specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of para<!-- PDFPage:697 -->graph (1), payments to the State under this subchapter shall be withheld in whole or in part, or payments by the State educational agency under this subchapter shall be limited to local educational agencies and State agencies whose actions did not cause or were not involved in the failure, as the case may be. Any State educational agency, State agency, or local educational agency that has received notice under paragraph (1) shall, by means of a public notice, take such measures as may be necessary to bring the pendency of an action pursuant to this subsection to the attention of the public within the jurisdiction of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any State is dissatisfied with the Secretary's final action with respect to the eligibility of the State under section 1412 of this title, such State may, not later than 60 days after notice of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of that action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings upon which the Secretary's action was based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction; review by United States Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Standard of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Divided State agency responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, where responsibility for ensuring that the requirements of this subchapter are met with respect to children with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons is assigned to a public agency other than the State educational agency pursuant to section 1412(a)(11)(C) of this title, the Secretary, in instances where the Secretary finds that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of this subchapter are related to a failure by the public agency, shall take appropriate corrective action to ensure compliance with this subchapter, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any reduction or withholding of payments to the State is proportionate to the total funds allotted under section 1411 of this title to the State as the number of eligible children with disabilities in adult prisons under the supervision of the other public agency is proportionate to the number of eligible individuals with disabilities in the State under the supervision of the State educational agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any withholding of funds under paragraph (1) shall be limited to the specific agency responsible for the failure to comply with this subchapter.</p>
