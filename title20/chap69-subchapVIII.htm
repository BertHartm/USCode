<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1289 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that such agency is not being substantially compensated for the loss in revenue resulting from such ownership by increases in revenue accruing to the agency from the conduct of Federal activities with respect to such Federal property,</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of weighted student units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 2,000 and such number equals or exceeds 15 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at least 400 such children; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this subsection for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local <!-- PDFPage:1291 -->educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For any fiscal year in which the sums appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title are insufficient to pay to each local educational agency the full amount computed under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make payments in accordance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall compute a learning opportunity threshold payment (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;threshold payment&rdquo;) by multiplying the amount obtained under paragraph (1)(C) by the total percentage obtained by adding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the percentage of federally connected children for each local educational agency determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of children described under subsection (a)(1) of this section and the denominator of which is the total number of children in average daily attendance at the schools served by such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the percentage that funds under paragraph (1)(C) represent of the total budget of the local educational agency, determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of funds calculated for each local educational agency under this paragraph (not including amounts received under subsection (f) of this section), and the denominator of which is the total current expenditures for such agency in the second preceding fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Such total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 100.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For the purpose of determining the percentages described in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) that are applicable to the local educational agency providing free public education to students in grades 9 through 12 residing on Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, the Secretary shall consider only that portion of such agency's total enrollment of students in grades 9 through 12 when calculating the percentage under such subclause (I) and only that portion of the total current expenditures attributed to the operation of grades 9 through 12 in such agency when calculating the percentage under subclause (II).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Ratable distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall make payments as a ratable distribution based upon the computation made under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prior year data</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (f) of this section, all calculations under this section shall be based on data for each local educational agency from not later than the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the agency is making application for payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Calculations for a local educational agency that is newly established by a State shall, for the first year of operation of such agency, be based on data from the fiscal year for which the agency is making application for payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Children with disabilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(c) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay to each eligible local educational agency, on a pro rata basis, the amounts determined by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If additional funds become available for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under clause (i) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional assistance for heavily impacted local educational agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From amounts appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide additional assistance to meet special circumstances relating to the provision of education in local educational agencies eligible to receive assistance under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A local educational agency is eligible to receive additional assistance under this subsection only if such agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i)(I) has an enrollment of federally connected children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section which constitutes a percentage of the total student enrollment of such agency which is not less than 50 percent if such agency receives a payment on behalf of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of such subsection, or not less than 40 percent if such agency does not receive a payment on behalf of such children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) has a tax rate for general fund purposes which is at least 95 percent of the average tax rate for general fund purposes of comparable local educational agencies in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii)(I) has an enrollment of federally connected children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section which constitutes at least 35 percent of the total student enrollment of such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) has a tax rate for general fund purposes which is at least 125 percent of the average tax rate for general fund purposes of comparable local educational agencies in the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is a local educational agency whose boundaries are the same as a Federal military installation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any local educational agency determined eligible under clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall be deemed to have met the tax effort requirements for eligibility under clause (i)(II) or (ii)(II) of such subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Maximum payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall determine the maximum amount that a local educational agency may receive under this subsection in accordance with the following computations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The Secretary shall first determine the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located or the average per-pupil expenditure of all the States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the average per-pupil expenditure of generally comparable local edu<!-- PDFPage:1293 -->cational agencies located in the State of the local educational agency, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the average per-pupil expenditure of three generally comparable local educational agencies located in the State of the local educational agency, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The Secretary shall next subtract from the amount determined under clause (i) the average amount of State aid per pupil received by the local educational agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The Secretary shall next multiply the amount determined under clause (ii) by the total number of students in average daily attendance at the schools of the local educational agency as determined by the Secretary under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) If the tax rate used by the local educational agency is greater than 95 percent, but less than 100 percent, of the tax rate of comparable local educational agencies, the Secretary shall next multiply the amount determined under clause (iii) by the percentage that the tax rate of the local educational agency is of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the average tax rate of its generally comparable local educational agencies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the average tax rate of all the local educational agencies in the State in which the local educational agency is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) The Secretary shall next subtract the total amount of payments received by a local educational agency under subsections (b) and (d) of this section for a fiscal year from the amount determined under clause (iii) or clause (iv), as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to payments under this subsection for a local educational agency described in clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (2)(A), the maximum amount of such payments shall be computed by taking the product of the average per-pupil expenditure in all States multiplied by 0.7, except that such amount may not exceed 125 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in all local educational agencies in the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Current year data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, for purposes of providing assistance under this subsection, use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) student and revenue data from the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is applying for assistance under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the most recent data available which is adjusted to such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reduction in payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds appropriated to carry out this subsection are insufficient to pay in full the amounts determined under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall ratably reduce the payment to each eligible local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Additional payments for local educational agencies with high concentrations of children with severe disabilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any local educational agency receives Federal funds from sources other than this subchapter to carry out the purposes of this subchapter for any fiscal year due to the enrollment of children described under subsection (a) of this section, then the Secretary shall consider such funds as a payment to such agency under this subchapter<sup><a href="#7703_1_target" name="7703_1">1</a></sup> for such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if funds appropriated pursuant to section 7714(b) of this title for payments under subsection (b) of this section to such agency for a fiscal year which, when added to the funds described in paragraph (1) received by such agency for such fiscal year, exceed the maximum amount described under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section, then the Secretary shall make available from the funds appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for such fiscal year such excess amounts to any local educational agency serving two or more children described under subparagraph (B) or (D) of subsection (a)(1) of this section who have a severe disability and a parent serving in the uniformed services (as defined by section 101 of title 37) who is assigned to a particular permanent duty station for compassionate reasons (compassionate post assignment) for the total costs associated with such children who are provided an educational program provided outside the schools of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remaining funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds remain after payments are made under paragraph (2) for any fiscal year, then such remaining funds shall be made available for expenditures under subsection (d) of this section in such fiscal year on a pro rata basis consistent with the requirements of such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Ratable reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If amounts available to carry out paragraph (2) for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay in full the total payment that all eligible local educational agencies are eligible to receive under such paragraph for such year, then the Secretary shall ratably reduce such payments to such agencies for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Other funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a local educational agency receiving funds under this section may also receive funds under section 6 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) or such section's successor authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Maintenance of effort</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A local educational agency may receive funds under subsection (b) of this section and section 7702 of this title for any fiscal year only if the <!-- PDFPage:1294 -->State educational agency finds that either the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of that agency and the State with respect to the provision of free public education by that agency for the preceding fiscal year was not less than 90 percent of such combined fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the second preceding fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary, or if the remedy required is not undertaken within the time established and the Secretary determines that an extension of the time established will not effectively encourage the remedy required, the Secretary shall withhold payment of all moneys to which such local agency is eligible under section 7703 of this title until such time as the remedy required is undertaken, except where the complaining tribe or its designee formally requests that such funds be released to the local educational agency, except that the Secretary may not withhold such moneys during the course of the school year if the Secretary determines that such withholding would substantially disrupt the educational programs of the local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Rejection of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary and a tribe exercises the option under section 1101(d) of the Education Amendments of 1978, to have education services provided either directly by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or by contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, any Indian students affiliated with that tribe who wish to remain in attendance at the local educational agency against whom the complaint which led to the tribal action under such subsection (d) of this section was lodged may be counted with respect to that local educational agency for the purpose of receiving funds under section 7703 of this title. In such event, funds under such section shall not be withheld pursuant to paragraph (8) and no further complaints with respect to such students may be filed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section is based upon the special relationship between the Indian nations and the United States and nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any State of any duty with respect to any citizens of that State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of such aid; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make such aid available to local educational agencies in a manner that results in less State aid to any local educational agency that is eligible for such payment than such agency would receive if such agency were not so eligible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State equalization plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may reduce State aid to a local educational agency that receives a payment under section 7702 or 7703(b) of this title (except the amount calculated in excess of 1.0 under subparagraph (B) of section 7703(a)(2) of this title) or under the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994 (other than an increase in payments described in paragraphs (2)(B), (2)(C), (2)(D), or (3)(B)(ii) of section 3(d) of such Act of September 30, 1950) for any fiscal year if the Secretary determines, and certifies under subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section, that such State has in effect a program of State aid that equalizes expenditures for free public education among local educational agencies in such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local educational agencies if, in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the amount of per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the highest such per-pupil expenditures or revenues did not exceed the amount of such per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the lowest such expenditures or revenues by more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 25 percent for fiscal year 1995, 1996, or 1997; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 20 percent for fiscal year 1998 or 1999.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) take into account the extent to which a program of State aid reflects the additional cost of providing free public education in particular types of local educational agencies, such as those that are geographically isolated, or to particular types of students, such as children with disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State has substantially revised its program of State aid, the Secretary may certify such program for any fiscal year only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary determines, on the basis of projected data, that the State's program will meet the disparity standard described in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State provides an assurance to the Secretary that, if final data do not demonstrate that the State's program met such standard for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the State will pay to each affected local educational agency the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the local educational agency.</p>
