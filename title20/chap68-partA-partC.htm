<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) National Institute on Student Achievement, Curriculum, and Assessment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The current achievement levels of students in the United States are far below those that might indicate competency in challenging subject matter in core content areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) During the last 20 years, relatively little changed in how students were taught. Despite much research suggesting better al<!-- PDFPage:958 -->ternatives, classrooms continue to be dominated by textbooks, teacher lectures, short-answer activity sheets, and unequal patterns of student attention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Despite progress in narrowing the gaps, the differences in performance between Caucasian students and their minority counterparts remain unacceptably large. While progress has been made in reducing the gender gap in mathematics, such gap still remains at higher levels of problem solving. Too little progress has been made in reducing gender performance gaps favoring males in science and females in writing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of the National Institute on Student Achievement, Curriculum, and Assessment is to carry out a coordinated and comprehensive program of research and development to provide research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve student achievement in core content areas and the integration of such areas. Such program shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may reflect recommendations made by the National Education Goals Panel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) National Institute on the Education of At-Risk Students</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The rate of decline in our urban schools is escalating at a rapid pace. Student performance in most inner city schools grows worse each year. At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate 4 years later and many more students from high-poverty backgrounds leave school with skills that are inadequate for today's workplace. Student performance in many inner city neighborhoods grows worse each year. At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate in 4 years. In 1992, the average National Assessment of Educational Progress reading score of Caucasian 17 year-olds was approximately 25 points higher than that of African-American 17 year-olds and 20 points higher than that of Hispanic 17 year-olds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Rural schools enroll a disproportionately large share of the poor and at-risk students of the United States and yet often lack the means to address effectively the needs of these children. Intensive efforts should be made to overcome the problems of geographic isolation, declining population, inadequate financial resources and other impediments to the educational success of children residing in rural areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) By the year 2000, an estimated 3,400,000 school age children with limited-English proficiency will be entering the school system. The Federal Government should develop effective policies and programs to address the educational needs of this growing population of children who are at increased risk of educational failure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) An educational emergency exists in those urban and rural areas where there are large concentrations of children who live in poverty. The numbers of disadvantaged children will substantially increase by the year 2020, when the number of impoverished children alone will be 16,500,000, a 33 percent increase over the 12,400,000 children in poverty in 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) American Indian and Alaska Native students have high dropout, illiteracy and poverty rates, and experience cultural, linguistic, social and geographic isolation. The estimated 400,000 Indian and Alaska Native student population from over 500 Indian and Alaska Native tribes, is small and scattered throughout remote reservations and villages in 32 States, and in off-reservation rural and urban communities where Indians constitute but a small percentage of public school student bodies. To meaningfully address the special educational needs of this historically under-served population, the existing research and development system should be opened to Indian and Alaska Native people to identify needs and design ways to address such needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Minority scholars as well as institutions and groups that have been historically committed to the improvement of the education of at-risk students need to be more fully mobilized in the effort to develop a new generation of programs, models, practices, and schools capable of responding to the urgent needs of students who are educationally at-risk.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be the purpose of the Institute on the Education of At-Risk Students to carry out a coordinated and comprehensive program of research and development to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve educational opportunities for at-risk students. Such program shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) undertake research necessary to provide a sound basis from which to identify, develop, evaluate, and assist others to replicate and adapt interventions, programs, and models which promote greater achievement and educational success by at-risk students, such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) methods of instruction and educational practices (including community services) which improve the achievement and retention of at-risk students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the quality of educational opportunities afforded at-risk students, particularly the quality of educational opportunities afforded such students in highly concentrated urban areas and sparsely populated rural areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) methods for overcoming the barriers to learning that may impede student achievement;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:960 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) innovative teacher training and professional development methods to help at-risk students meet challenging standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) methods to improve the quality of the education of American Indian and Alaska Native students not only in schools funded by the Bureau, but also in public elementary and secondary schools located on or near Indian reservations, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) research on mechanisms to facilitate the establishment of tribal departments of education that assume responsibility for all education programs of State educational agencies operating on an Indian reservation and all education programs funded by the Bureau on an Indian reservation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) research on the development of culturally appropriate curriculum for American Indian and Alaska Native students, including American Indian and Alaska Native culture, language, geography, history and social studies, and graduation requirements related to such curriculum;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) research on methods for recruiting, training and retraining qualified teachers from American Indian and Alaska Native communities, including research to promote flexibility in the criteria for certification of such teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) research on techniques for improving the educational achievement of American Indian and Alaska Native students, including methodologies to reduce dropout rates and increase graduation by such students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) research concerning the performance by American Indian and Alaska Native students of limited-English proficiency on standardized achievement tests, and related factors;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) means by which parents and community resources and institutions (including cultural institutions) can be utilized to support and improve the achievement of at-risk students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) the training of teachers and other educational professionals and paraprofessionals to work more effectively with at-risk students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) the most effective uses of technology in the education of at-risk students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) programs designed to promote gender equity in schools that serve at-risk students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(x) improving the ability of classroom teachers and schools to assist new and diverse populations of students in successfully assimilating into the classroom environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xi) methods of assessing the achievement of students which are sensitive to cultural differences, provide multiple methods of assessing student learning, support student acquisition of higher order capabilities, and enable identification of the effects of inequalities in the resources available to support the learning of children throughout the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xii) other topics relevant to the purpose of the Institute; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) maximize the participation of those schools and institutions of higher education that serve the greatest number of at-risk students in inner city and rural areas, and on Indian reservations, including model collaborative programs between schools and school systems, institutions of higher education, cultural institutions, and community organizations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consultation with Indian and Alaska Native educators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All research and development activities supported by the Institute which relate to the education of Indian and Alaska Native students shall be developed in close consultation with Indian and Alaska Native researchers and educators, Tribally Controlled Community Colleges, tribal departments of education, and others with expertise in the needs of Indian and Native Alaska students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National Institute on Early Childhood Development and Education</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Despite efforts to expand and improve preschool programs, many children still reach school age unprepared to benefit from formal education programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Early intervention for disadvantaged children from birth to age five has been shown to be a highly cost-effective strategy for reducing later expenditures on a wide variety of health, developmental, and educational problems that often interfere with learning. Long-term studies of the benefits of preschool education have a demonstrated return on investment ranging from three to six dollars for every one dollar spent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Federal Government should play a central role in providing research-based information on early childhood education models which enhance children's development and ultimately their success in school.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The American system of postsecondary education is foremost in the world in such system's achievement of both academic excellence and equity in access, but maintaining that preeminence requires renewed efforts to strengthen the quality of postsecondary education. Disappointing student performance on achievement tests and licensure examinations, declining rates of postsecondary education persistence and completion among minorities, and other troubling trends in the quality of postsecondary education should be addressed by the United States as part of its overall drive to improve American education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The need to improve our economic productivity of the United States to meet the competitive challenges of a new, international economy, coupled with high levels of mobility in the United States labor market and demographic changes in the workforce, now demands more and higher quality programs of learning and training in the American workplace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The more than 1,000,000 men and women incarcerated in the prisons and jails in the United States are among the most severely educationally disadvantaged in the United States, with high rates of functional illiteracy and extremely low levels of educational attainment. Since an estimated 90 percent of these individuals are expected to be released by the end of the decade, the United States must act to assure that our correctional system has the means to equip these Americans with the knowledge and skills they will need to participate productively in our society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The development of a &ldquo;Nation of Students&rdquo; capable of and committed to the pursuit of formal and informal lifelong learning and literacy is essential to sustain both national and individual economic success and to provide a nurturing environment in which all children and youth can learn and achieve. Historically the most effective community resource for lifelong learning, the public library system of the United States, should expand and restructure its delivery of services to take full advantage of the potential of new information technologies to meet the needs of learning communities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of the National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning is to promote greater coordination of Federal research and development on issues related to adult learning and to carry out a program of research and development in adult learning to provide nonpartisan, research-based leadership to the United States as it seeks to improve libraries, postsecondary education, literacy, and lifelong learning throughout the United States. Such program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall only support research and development in those areas of postsecondary education, libraries, literacy, and lifelong learning which are not being addressed by other entities within the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may include basic and applied research, development, replication, and evaluation activities in areas such as&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xiv) the role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Indian Community Colleges, women's colleges, and other special mission institutions in providing access, excellence, and equal opportunity in higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xv) methods for evaluating the quality of education at different types of institutions of higher education at all levels and the roles and responsibilities of regional and national accrediting agencies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xvii) financial barriers to postsecondary educational opportunity, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the role of Federal programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] and State grant and work programs in mitigating such barriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the impact of the rising total cost of postsecondary education on access to higher education; and</p>
