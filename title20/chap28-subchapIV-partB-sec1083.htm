Any disclosure required by this subsection may be made by an eligible lender as part of the written application material provided to the borrower, or as part of the promissory note evidencing the loan, or on a separate written form provided to the borrower. The disclosure shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) an explanation of any special options the borrower may have for loan consolidation or other refinancing of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) a statement that the borrower has the right to prepay all or part of the loan, at any time, without penalty, a statement summarizing circumstances in which repayment of the loan or interest that accrues on the loan may be deferred, and a brief notice of the program for repayment of loans, on the basis of military service, pursuant to section 902 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981 (10 U.S.C. 2141, note);&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1083_1_target" name="1083_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) a definition of default and the consequences to the borrower if the borrower defaults, including a statement that the default will be reported to a credit bureau or credit reporting agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) an explanation of any cost the borrower may incur in the making or collection of the loan.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:314 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required disclosure before repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each eligible lender shall, at or prior to the start of the repayment period of the student borrower on loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, disclose to the borrower the information required under this subsection. For any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, other than a loan made under section 1078&ndash;2 or 1078&ndash;3 of this title, such disclosure required by this subsection shall be made not less than 30 days nor more than 240 days before the first payment on the loan is due from the borrower. The disclosure shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the name of the eligible lender, and the address to which communications and payments should be sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the scheduled date upon which the repayment period is to begin;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cost of disclosure and consequences of nondisclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such information shall be available without cost to the borrower. The failure of an eligible lender to provide information as required by this section shall not (1) relieve a borrower of the obligation to repay a loan in accordance with its terms, (2) provide a basis for a claim for civil damages, or (3) be deemed to abrogate the obligation of the Secretary under a contract of insurance or reinsurance, or the obligation of a guaranty agency under a contract of guaranty. Nothing in this section shall be construed as subjecting the lender to the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] with regard to loans made under this part. The Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the continued participation of an eligible lender in making loans under this part for failure by that lender to comply with this section.</p>

The requirement of this subsection shall be in addition to the information required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special disclosure rules on SLS loans and PLUS loans and unsubsidized loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans made under sections 1078&ndash;1,<sup><a href="#1083_2_target" name="1083_2">2</a></sup> 1078&ndash;2, and 1078&ndash;8 of this title shall not be subject to the disclosure of projected monthly payment amounts required under subsection (b)(8) of this section if the lender, in lieu of such disclosure, provides the borrower with sample projections of monthly repayment amounts assuming different levels of borrowing and interest accruals resulting from capitalization of interest while the borrower is in school. Such sample projections shall disclose the cost to the student of capitalizing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) principal and interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) interest only.</p>
