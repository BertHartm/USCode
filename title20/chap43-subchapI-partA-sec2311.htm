<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), from the remainder of the sums appropriated pursuant to section 2302(a) and (b) of this title, the Secretary shall allot to each State for each fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an amount which bears the same ratio to 50 percent of the sums being allotted as the product of the population aged fifteen to nineteen inclusive, in the State in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the State's allotment ratio bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an amount which bears the same ratio to 20 percent of the sums being allotted as the product of the population aged twenty to twenty-four, inclusive, in the State in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the State's allotment ratio bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States;</p>

Amounts necessary for increasing such payments to States to comply with the preceding sentence shall be obtained by ratably reducing the amounts to be paid to other States, but no such amount shall be reduced to an amount which is less than the amount a State received under the Act&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2311_1_target" name="2311_1">1</a></sup> for each such program for fiscal year 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If for any fiscal year the amount appropriated for programs authorized by subchapter II of this chapter or part B of subchapter III of this chapter and available for allotment under this section is insufficient to satisfy the provisions of clause (i), the payments to all States for each such program shall be ratably reduced as necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject to subparagraphs (A), (C), and (D) and clause (ii), for any fiscal year for which the amounts appropriated for programs authorized by subchapter II of this chapter or part A, B, C, or D of subchapter III of this chapter (and available for allotment under this section) exceed the amounts so available for fiscal year 1985, no State shall receive less than one-half of one percent of the amount available for each such program for that fiscal year under this subsection. Amounts necessary for increasing such payments to States to comply with the preceding sentence shall be obtained by ratably reducing the amounts to be paid to other States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Due to the application of the provisions of clause (i), for any fiscal year, no State shall re<!-- PDFPage:793 -->ceive more than 150 percent of the payments made to the State for each program authorized by subchapter II of this chapter, or part A, B, C, D, or E&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2311_2_target" name="2311_2">2</a></sup> of subchapter III of this chapter for the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the amount calculated under clause (ii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The amount calculated under this clause shall be determined by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the number of individuals in the State counted under paragraph (2) in the preceding fiscal year; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) 150 percent of the national average per pupil payment made with funds available under this section for that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reallotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that any amount of any State's allotment under subsection (a) of this section for any fiscal year will not be required for such fiscal year for carrying out the program for which such amount has been allotted, the Secretary shall make such amount available for reallotment. Any such reallotment among other States shall occur on such dates during the same year as the Secretary shall fix, and shall be made on the basis of criteria established by regulation. No funds may be reallotted for any use other than the use for which they were appropriated. Any amount reallotted to a State under this subsection for any fiscal year shall remain available for obligation during the succeeding fiscal year and shall be deemed to be part of its allotment for the year in which it is obligated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allotment ratios</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The allotment ratio for any State shall be 1.00 less the product of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quotient obtained by dividing the per capita income for the State by the per capita income for all the States (exclusive of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), except that (i) the allotment ratio in no case shall be more than 0.60 or less than 0.40 and (ii) the allotment ratio for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be 0.60.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The allotment ratios shall be promulgated by the Secretary for each fiscal year between October 1 and December 31 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made. Allotment ratios shall be computed on the basis of the average of the appropriate per capita incomes for the three most recent consecutive fiscal years for which satisfactory data are available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The term &ldquo;per capita income&rdquo; means, with respect to a fiscal year, the total personal income in the calendar year ending in such year, divided by the population of the area concerned in such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purposes of this section, population shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the latest estimates available to the Department.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;State&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; means any 1 of the 50 States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
