<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that there is an urgent and substantial need&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities and to minimize their potential for developmental delay,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to minimize the likelihood of institutionalization of individuals with disabilities and maximize the potential for their independent living in society,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to enhance the capacity of State and local agencies and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs of histori<!-- PDFPage:736 -->cally underrepresented populations, particularly minority, low-income, inner-city, and rural populations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore the policy of the United States to provide financial assistance to States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency program of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to enhance their capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing early intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.</p>
