Alternative origination services, through which an entity other than the participating institution at which the student is in attendance originates the loan, shall be provided by the Secretary, through 1 or more contracts under section 1087f(b) of this title or such other means as the Secretary may provide, for students attending participating institutions that do not originate direct student loans under this part. Such agreements for the academic year 1994&ndash;1995 shall, to the extent feasible, be entered into not later than January 1, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transition provisions</h4>
