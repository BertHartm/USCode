<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall review all eligible institutions of higher education in a State to determine if any such institution meets any of the criteria in subsection (b) of this section. If any such institution meets one or more of such criteria, the Secretary shall inform the State in which such institution is located that the institution has met such criteria, and the State shall review the institution pursuant to the standards in subsection (d) of this section. The Secretary may determine that a State need not review an institution if such institution meets the criterion in subsection (b)(10) of this section only, such institution was previously reviewed by the State under subsection (d), and the State determined in such previous review that the institution did not violate any of the standards in subsection (d) of this section. The Secretary shall supply the State with a copy of the institutional audits, required pursuant to section 1094(c) of this title, for the institutions which shall be reviewed by the State. In addition to those institutions identified by the Secretary, the State may, subject to approval by the Secretary, review additional institutions which meet one or more of the criteria provided in subsection (b) of this section, based on more recent data available to the State, or which the State has reason to believe are engaged in fraudulent practices. If the Secretary fails to approve or disapprove a State request to review additional institutions within 21 days, the State may proceed to review such additional institutions as if approved by the Secretary.</p>
