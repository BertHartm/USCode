<p class="statutory-body-1em">Thirty percent shall be allocated to such local educational agencies in proportion to the number of individuals aged 5 through 17, inclusive, who reside in the school district served by such local educational agency for the preceding fiscal year compared to the total num<!-- PDFPage:995 -->ber of such individuals who reside in the school districts served by all local educational agencies in the State for such preceding fiscal year, as determined on the basis of the most recent satisfactory&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Seventy percent</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) includes a proposal for such an alternative formula.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Minimum allocation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount to be allocated under paragraph (1) to a local educational agency that has jurisdiction only over secondary schools shall be determined based on the number of students that entered such secondary schools in the previous year from the elementary schools involved.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appeals procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The eligible agency shall establish an appeals procedure for resolution of any dispute arising between a local educational agency and an area career and technical education school or an educational service agency with respect to the allocation procedures described in this section, including the decision of a local educational agency to leave a consortium or terminate a cooperative arrangement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consortium requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Alliance</h4>
