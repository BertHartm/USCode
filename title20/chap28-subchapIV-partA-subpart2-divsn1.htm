<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this division, carry out a program of making grants and contracts designed to identify qualified individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, to prepare them for a program of postsecondary education, to provide support services for such students who are pursuing programs of postsecondary education, to motivate and prepare students for doctoral programs, and to train individuals serving or preparing for service in programs and projects so designed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recipients, duration, and size</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Minimum grant level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any year in which the appropriations authorized under this division exceed the prior year appropriation as adjusted for inflation, the Secretary shall use 80 percent of the amount appropriated above the current services level to bring each award up to the minimum grant level or the amount requested by the institution or agency, whichever is less. The minimum grant level (A) for programs authorized under section 1070a&ndash;14 or 1070a&ndash;17 of this title, shall not be less than $170,000 for fiscal year 1993; (B) for programs authorized under section 1070a&ndash;12 or 1070a&ndash;16 of this title shall not be less than $180,000 for fiscal year 1994; and (C) for programs authorized under section 1070a&ndash;13 or 1070a&ndash;15 of this title shall not be less than $190,000 for fiscal year 1995.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures for awarding grants and contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prior experience</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making grants and contracts under this division, the Secretary shall consider the prior experience of service delivery under the particular program for which funds are sought by each applicant. For fiscal years after 1985, the level of consideration given to prior experience shall not vary from the level of consideration given this factor for fiscal year 1985, except that in the case of the programs authorized in sections 1070a&ndash;15 and 1070a&ndash;17 of this title, the level of consideration given to prior experience shall be the same as the level of consideration given this factor in the other programs authorized in this division.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Order of awards; program fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except with respect to grants made under section 1070a&ndash;17 of this title, and as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall award grants and contracts under this division in the order of the scores received by the application for such grant or contract in the peer review process required under section 1145d&ndash;1 of this title and adjusted for prior experience in accordance with paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary is not required to provide assistance to a program otherwise eligible for assistance under this division, if the Secretary has determined that such program has involved the fraudulent use of funds under this division.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Peer review process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall assure that, to the extent practicable, members of groups underrepresented in higher education, including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native American Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians), are represented as readers of applications submitted under this division. The Secretary shall also assure that persons from urban and rural backgrounds are represented as readers.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:214 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall ensure that each application submitted under this division is read by at least 3 readers who are not employees of the Federal Government (other than as readers of applications).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Application status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall inform each entity operating programs under this division regarding the status of their application for continued funding at least 8 months prior to the expiration of the grant or contract. The Secretary, in the case of an entity that is continuing to operate a successful program under this division, shall ensure that the start-up date for a new grant or contract for such program immediately follows the termination of preceding grant or contract so that no interruption of funding occurs for such successful reapplicants. The Secretary shall inform each entity requesting assistance under this subpart for a new program regarding the status of their application at least 8 months prior to the proposed startup date of such program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Number of applications for grants and contracts</h4>
