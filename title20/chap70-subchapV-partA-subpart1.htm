<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) children living in areas with high concentrations of economically disadvantaged families;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations and requirements</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Calculation of enrollments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The calculation of relative enrollments under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be on the basis of the total of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of children enrolled in public schools; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of children enrolled in private nonprofit schools that participated in programs assisted under this part, for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the responsibility of each local educational agency to contact, on an annual basis, appropriate officials from private nonprofit schools within the areas served by such agencies in order to determine whether such schools desire that their children participate in programs assisted under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) State criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Relative enrollments calculated under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be adjusted, in accordance with criteria approved by the Secretary under subparagraph (B), to provide higher per-pupil allocations only to local educational agencies that serve the greatest numbers or percentages of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) children living in areas with high concentrations of economically disadvantaged families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) children from economically disadvantaged families; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) children living in sparsely populated areas.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Review of criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall review criteria submitted by a State educational agency for adjusting allocations under paragraph (1) and shall approve such criteria only if the Secretary determines that such criteria are reasonably calculated to produce an adjusted allocation that reflects the relative needs of the State's local educational agencies based on the factors set forth in subparagraph (A).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the funds paid to a State educational agency under this subpart for a fiscal year, the State educational agency shall distribute to each eligible local educational agency that has submitted an application as required by section 7215b of this title the amount of such local educational agency's allocation, as determined under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Additional funds resulting from higher per-pupil allocations provided to a local educational agency on the basis of adjusted enrollments of children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section may, in the discretion of the local educational agency, be allocated for expenditures to provide services for children enrolled in public schools and private nonprofit schools in direct proportion to the number of children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and enrolled in such schools within the area served by the local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any fiscal year, any local educational agency that elects to allocate such additional funds in the manner described in subparagraph (A) shall allocate all additional funds to schools within the area served by the local educational agency in such manner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B) may not be construed to require any school to limit the use of the additional funds described in subparagraph (A) to the provision of services to specific students or categories of students.</p>
