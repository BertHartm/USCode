<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) how the program will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) improve student academic achievement in mathematics, science, and, where applicable, technology and engineering and increase the number of students taking upper-level courses in such subjects; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase the numbers of elementary school and secondary school students enrolled and continuing in critical foreign language courses;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) how the program will prepare participants to become more effective science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) how the program will prepare participants to assume leadership roles in their schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) how teachers (or science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language professionals) who are members of groups that are underrepresented in the teaching of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign languages and teachers from schools determined by the partnership to be most in need will be encouraged to apply for and participate in the program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the ongoing activities and services that will be provided to graduates of the program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) how the partnership will continue the activities assisted under the grant when the grant period ends;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) how the partnership will assess, during the program, the content knowledge and teaching skills of the program participants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) methods to ensure applicants to the master's degree program for professionals in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language demonstrate advanced knowledge in the relevant subject.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorized activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each eligible recipient receiving a grant under this section shall use the grant funds to develop and implement a 2- or 3-year part-time master's degree program in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or critical foreign language education for teachers in order to enhance the teachers&rsquo; content knowledge and teaching skills, or programs for professionals in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a critical foreign language that lead to a 1-year master's degree in teaching that results in teacher certification. The program shall&mdash;</p>
