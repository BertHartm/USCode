This purpose can be accomplished by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensuring that high-quality academic assessments, accountability systems, teacher preparation and training, curriculum, and instructional materials are aligned with challenging State academic standards so that students, teachers, parents, and administrators can measure progress against common expectations for student academic achievement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) meeting the educational needs of low-achieving children in our Nation's highest-poverty schools, limited English proficient children, migratory children, children with disabilities, Indian children, neglected or delinquent children, and young children in need of reading assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) closing the achievement gap between high- and low-performing children, especially the achievement gaps between minority and nonminority students, and between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) holding schools, local educational agencies, and States accountable for improving the academic achievement of all students, and identifying and turning around low-performing schools that have failed to provide a high-quality education to their students, while providing alternatives to students in such schools to enable the students to receive a high-quality education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) distributing and targeting resources sufficiently to make a difference to local educational agencies and schools where needs are greatest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) improving and strengthening accountability, teaching, and learning by using State assessment systems designed to ensure that students are meeting challenging State academic achievement and content standards and increasing achievement overall, but especially for the disadvantaged;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) providing greater decisionmaking authority and flexibility to schools and teachers in exchange for greater responsibility for student performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) providing children an enriched and accelerated educational program, including the use of schoolwide programs or additional services that increase the amount and quality of instructional time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) promoting schoolwide reform and ensuring the access of children to effective, scientifically based instructional strategies and challenging academic content;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) significantly elevating the quality of instruction by providing staff in participating schools with substantial opportunities for professional development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) coordinating services under all parts of this subchapter with each other, with other educational services, and, to the extent feasible, with other agencies providing services to youth, children, and families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) affording parents substantial and meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.], the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2000 (as contained in Public Law 106&ndash;113) [Pub. L. 106&ndash;113, div. B, &sect;1000(a)(4) [title III], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1535, 1501A&ndash;242, see Tables for classification], and in order to take actions to improve low-performing schools, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Since 1993, this Administration has sought to raise standards for students and to increase accountability in public education while investing more resources in elementary and secondary schools. While much has been accomplished&mdash;there has been progress in math and reading achievement, particularly for low-achieving students and students in our highest poverty schools&mdash;much more can be done, especially for low-performing schools.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Technical Assistance and Capacity Building</em>. (a) The Secretary of Education (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall work with State and local educational agencies (&ldquo;LEAs&rdquo;) to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for providing technical assistance and other assistance to States and LEAs to strengthen their capacity to improve the performance of schools identified as low performing. This comprehensive strategy shall include a number of steps, such as:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) providing States, school districts, and schools receiving funds from the school improvement fund established by Public Law 106&ndash;113, as well as other districts and schools identified for school improvement or corrective action under Title I of the ESEA [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.], with access to the latest research and information on best practices, including research on instruction and educator professional development, and with the opportunity to learn from exemplary schools and exemplary State and local intervention strategies and from each other, in order to improve achievement for all students in the low-performing schools;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) determining effective ways of providing low-performing schools with access to resources from other Department of Education programs, such as funds from the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration Program, the Reading Excellence Act [Pub. L. 105&ndash;277, div. A, &sect;101(f) [title VIII], Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2681&ndash;337, 2681&ndash;391, see Tables for classification], the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, the Class Size Reduction Program, and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program, and to make effective use of these funds and Title I funds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) providing States and LEAs with information on effective strategies to improve the quality of the teaching force, including strategies for recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers in high-poverty schools, and implementing research-based profes<!-- PDFPage:1181 -->sional development programs aligned with challenging standards;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) helping States and school districts build partnerships with technical assistance providers, including, but not limited to, federally funded laboratories and centers, foundations, businesses, community-based organizations, institutions of higher education, reform model providers, and other organizations that can help local schools improve;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) identifying previously low-performing schools that have made significant achievement gains, and States and school districts that have been effective in improving the achievement of all students in low-performing schools, which can serve as models and resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(6) providing assistance and information on how to effectively involve parents in the school-improvement process, including effectively involving and informing parents at the beginning of the school year about improvement goals for their school as well as the goals for their own children, and reporting on progress made in achieving these goals;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(7) providing States and LEAs with information on effective approaches to school accountability, including the effectiveness of such strategies as school reconstitution, peer review teams, and financial rewards and incentives;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(8) providing LEAs with information and assistance on the design and implementation of approaches to choice among public schools that create incentives for improvement throughout the local educational agency, especially in the lowest-performing schools, and that maximize the opportunity of students in low-performing schools to attend a higher-performing public school;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(9) exploring the use of well-trained tutors to raise student achievement through initiatives such as &ldquo;America Reads,&rdquo; &ldquo;America Counts,&rdquo; and other work-study opportunities to help low-performing schools;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(10) using a full range of strategies for disseminating information about effective practices, including interactive electronic communications;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(11) working with the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), to provide technical assistance to BIA-funded low-performing schools; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(12) taking other steps that can help improve the quality of teaching and instruction in low-performing schools.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, take whatever steps the Secretary finds necessary and appropriate to redirect the resources and technical assistance capability of the Department of Education (&ldquo;Department&rdquo;) to assist States and localities in improving low-performing schools, and to ensure that the dissemination of research to help turn around low-performing schools is a priority of the Department.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>School Improvement Report</em>. To monitor the progress of LEAs and schools in turning around failing schools, including those receiving grants from the School Improvement Fund, the Secretary shall prepare an annual School Improvement Report, to be published in September of each year, beginning in 2000. The report shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) describe trends in the numbers of LEAs and schools identified as needing improvement and subsequent changes in the academic performance of their students;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) identify best practices and significant research findings that can be used to help turn around low-performing LEAs and schools; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) document ongoing efforts as a result of this order and other Federal efforts to assist States and local school districts in intervening in low-performing schools, including improving teacher quality. This report shall be publicly accessible.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Compliance Monitoring System</em>. Consistent with the implementation of the School Improvement Fund, the Secretary shall strengthen the Department's monitoring of ESEA requirements for identifying and turning around low-performing schools, as well as any new requirements established for the School Improvement Fund by Public Law 106&ndash;113. The Secretary shall give priority to provisions that have the greatest bearing on identifying and turning around low-performing schools, including sections 1116 and 1117 of the ESEA [20 U.S.C. 6316, 6317], and to developing an ongoing, focused, and systematic process for monitoring these provisions. This improved compliance monitoring shall be designed to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) ensure that States and LEAs comply with ESEA requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) assist States and LEAs in implementing effective procedures and strategies that reflect the best research available, as well as the experience of successful schools, school districts, and States as they address similar objectives and challenges; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) assist States, LEAs, and schools in making the most effective use of available Federal resources.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Consultation</em>. The Secretary shall, where appropriate, consult with executive agencies, State and local education officials, educators, community-based groups, and others in carrying out this Executive order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the subjects in which students will be served under this part, but for which a State is not required by subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to develop, and has not otherwise developed, such academic standards, the State plan shall describe a strategy for ensuring that students are taught the same knowledge and skills in such subjects and held to the same expectations as are all children.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Existing standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this part shall prohibit a State from revising, consistent with this section, any standard adopted under this part before or after January 8, 2002.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Accountability</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State has developed and is implementing a single, statewide State accountability system that will be effective in ensuring that all local educational agencies, public elementary schools, and public secondary schools make adequate yearly progress as defined under this paragraph. Each State accountability system shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1185 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) be based on the academic standards and academic assessments adopted under paragraphs (1) and (3), and other academic indicators consistent with subparagraph (C)(vi) and (vii), and shall take into account the achievement of all public elementary school and secondary school students;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) in accordance with subparagraph (D), includes graduation rates for public secondary school students (defined as the percentage of students who graduate from secondary school with a regular diploma in the standard number of years) and at least one other academic indicator, as determined by the State for all public elementary school students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) in accordance with subparagraph (D), at the State's discretion, may also include other academic indicators, as determined by the State for all public school students, measured separately for each group described in clause (v), such as achievement on additional State or locally administered assessments, decreases in grade-to-grade retention rates, attendance rates, and changes in the percentages of students completing gifted and talented, advanced placement, and college preparatory courses.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Requirements for other indicators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In carrying out subparagraph (C)(vi) and (vii), the State&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (I)(i), may not use those indicators to reduce the number of, or change, the schools that would otherwise be subject to school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under section 6316 of this title if those additional indicators were not used, but may use them to identify additional schools for school improvement or in need of corrective action or restructuring.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Starting point</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State, using data for the 2001&ndash;2002 school year, shall establish the starting point for measuring, under subparagraphs (G) and (H), the percentage of students meeting or exceeding the State's proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments under paragraph (3) and pursuant to the timeline described in subparagraph (F).

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) each group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v) must meet or exceed the objectives set by the State under subparagraph (G), except that if any group described in subparagraph (C)(v) does not meet those objectives in any particular year, the school shall be considered to have made adequate yearly progress if the percentage of students in that group who did not meet or exceed the proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments under paragraph (3) for that year decreased by 10 percent of that percentage from the preceding school year and that group made progress on one or more of the academic indicators described in subparagraph (C)(vi) or (vii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not less than 95 percent of each group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v) who are enrolled in the school are required to take the assessments, consistent with paragraph (3)(C)(xi) and with accommodations, guidelines, and alternative assessments provided in the same manner as those provided under section 612(a)(16)(A) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(16)(A)] and paragraph (3), on which adequate yearly progress is based (except that the 95 percent requirement described in this clause shall not apply in a case in which the number of students in a category is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(J) Uniform averaging procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of determining whether schools are making adequate yearly progress, the State may establish a uniform procedure for averaging data which includes one or more of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) grades 3 through 5;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) grades 6 through 9; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(cc) grades 10 through 12;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) at the discretion of the State, measure the proficiency of students in academic subjects not described in clauses (v), (vi), (vii) in which the State has adopted challenging academic content and academic achievement standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participation in such assessments of all students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the reasonable adaptations and accommodations for students with disabilities (as defined under section 602(3) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1401(3)]) necessary to measure the academic achievement of such students relative to State academic content and State student academic achievement standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the inclusion of limited English proficient students, who shall be assessed in a valid and reliable manner and provided reasonable accommodations on assessments administered to such students under this paragraph, including, to the extent practicable, assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate data on what such students know and can do in academic content areas, until such students have achieved English language proficiency as determined under paragraph (7);</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall use funds received under this part only in eligible school attendance areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible school attendance areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the term &ldquo;school attendance area&rdquo; means, in relation to a particular school, the geographical area in which the children who are normally served by that school reside; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the term &ldquo;eligible school attendance area&rdquo; means a school attendance area in which the percentage of children from low-income families is at least as high as the percentage of children from low-income families served by the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Ranking order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds allocated in accordance with subsection (c) of this section are insufficient to serve all eligible school attendance areas, a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank, without regard to grade spans, such agency's eligible school attendance areas in which the concentration of children from low-income families exceeds 75 percent from highest to lowest according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Remaining funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds remain after serving all eligible school attendance areas under paragraph (3), a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank such agency's remaining eligible school attendance areas from highest to lowest either by grade span or for the entire local educational agency according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order either within each grade-span grouping or within the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agency shall use the same measure of poverty, which measure shall be the number of children ages 5 through 17 in poverty counted in the most recent census data approved by the Secretary, the number of children eligible for free and reduced priced lunches under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], the number of children in families receiving assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], or the number of children eligible to receive medical assistance under the Medicaid program, or a composite of such indicators, with respect to all school attendance areas in the local educational agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to identify eligible school attendance areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to determine the ranking of each area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to determine allocations under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to a local educational agency with a total enrollment of less than 1,000 children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver for desegregation plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a local educational agency's written request for a waiver of the requirements of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, and permit such agency to treat as eligible, and serve, any school that children attend with a State-ordered, court-ordered school desegregation plan or a plan that continues to be implemented in accordance <!-- PDFPage:1199 -->with a State-ordered or court-ordered desegregation plan, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of economically disadvantaged children enrolled in the school is at least 25 percent of the school's total enrollment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines on the basis of a written request from such agency and in accordance with such criteria as the Secretary establishes, that approval of that request would further the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Local educational agency discretion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, a local educational agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designate as eligible any school attendance area or school in which at least 35 percent of the children are from low-income families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) use funds received under this part in a school that is not in an eligible school attendance area, if the percentage of children from low-income families enrolled in the school is equal to or greater than the percentage of such children in a participating school attendance area of such agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) designate and serve a school attendance area or school that is not eligible under this section, but that was eligible and that was served in the preceding fiscal year, but only for 1 additional fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) elect not to serve an eligible school attendance area or eligible school that has a higher percentage of children from low-income families if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the school meets the comparability requirements of section 6321(c) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the school is receiving supplemental funds from other State or local sources that are spent according to the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the funds expended from such other sources equal or exceed the amount that would be provided under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(D), the number of children attending private elementary schools and secondary schools who are to receive services, and the assistance such children are to receive under this part, shall be determined without regard to whether the public school attendance area in which such children reside is assisted under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall allocate funds received under this part to eligible school attendance areas or eligible schools, identified under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, in rank order, on the basis of the total number of children from low-income families in each area or school.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the per-pupil amount of funds allocated to each school attendance area or school under paragraph (1) shall be at least 125 percent of the per-pupil amount of funds a local educational agency received for that year under the poverty criteria described by the local educational agency in the plan submitted under section 6312 of this title, except that this paragraph shall not apply to a local educational agency that only serves schools in which the percentage of such children is 35 percent or greater.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency may reduce the amount of funds allocated under subparagraph (A) for a school attendance area or school by the amount of any supplemental State and local funds expended in that school attendance area or school for programs that meet the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall reserve such funds as are necessary under this part to provide services comparable to those provided to children in schools funded under this part to serve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) homeless children who do not attend participating schools, including providing educationally related support services to children in shelters and other locations where children may live;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) children in local institutions for neglected children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if appropriate, children in local institutions for delinquent children, and neglected or delinquent children in community day school programs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Standards for a bypass</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a local educational agency is prohibited by law from providing for the participation in programs on an equitable basis of eligible children enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools, or if the Secretary determines that a local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling, to provide for such participation, as required by this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) waive the requirements of this section for such local educational agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements that shall be subject to the requirements of this section and sections 7883 and 7884 of this title; and</p>

The District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be treated as individual local educational agencies. If a local educational agency contains two or more counties in their entirety, then each county will be treated as if such county were a separate local educational agency for purposes of calculating grants under this part. The total of grants for such counties shall be allocated to such a local educational agency, which local educational agency shall distribute to schools in each county within such agency a share of the local educational agency's total grant that is no less than the county's share of the population counts used to calculate the local educational agency's grant.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Criteria of poverty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the families that are below the poverty level, the Secretary shall use the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census, as the criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other children to be counted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For the purpose of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families above the poverty level on the basis of the number of such children from families receiving an annual income, in excess of the current criteria of poverty, from payments under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]; and in making such determinations, the Secretary shall use the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census for a family of four in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall determine the number of such children and the number of children aged 5 through 17 living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, or being supported in foster homes with public funds, on the basis of the caseload data for the month of October of the preceding fiscal year (using, in the case of children described in the preceding sentence, the criteria of poverty and the form of such criteria required by such sentence which were determined for the calendar year preceding such month of October) or, to the extent that such data are not available to the Secretary before January of the calendar year in which the Secretary's determination is made, then on the basis of the most recent reliable data available to the Secretary at the time of such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Except for the data on children living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall collect and transmit the information required by this subparagraph to the Secretary not later than January 1 of each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For the purpose of this section, the Secretary shall consider all children who are in correctional institutions to be living in institutions for delinquent children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Estimate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When requested by the Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce shall make a special updated estimate of the number of children of such ages who are from families below the poverty level (as determined under paragraph (1)(A)) in each school district, and the Secretary is authorized to pay (either in advance or by way of reimbursement) the Secretary of Commerce the cost of making this special estimate. The Secretary of Commerce shall give consideration to any request of the chief executive of a State for the collection of additional census information.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6336. Adequacy of funding of targeted grants to local educational agencies in fiscal years after fiscal year 2001</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The current Basic Grant Formula for the distribution of funds under this part often does not provide funds for the economically disadvantaged students for which such funds are targeted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any school district in which more than 2 percent of the students live below the poverty level qualifies for funding under the Basic Grant Formula. As a result, 9 out of every 10 school districts in the country receive some form of aid under the Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Fifty-eight percent of all schools receive at least some funding under this part, including many suburban schools with predominantly well-off students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) One out of every 5 schools with concentrations of poor students between 50 and 75 percent receive no funding at all under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In passing the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, Congress declared that grants under this part would more sharply target high poverty schools by using the Targeted Grant Formula, but annual appropriation Acts have prevented the use of that Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The advantage of the Targeted Grant Formula over other funding formulas under this part is that the Targeted Grant Formula provides increased grants per poor child as the percentage of economically disadvantaged children in a school district increases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Studies have found that the poverty of a child's family is much more likely to be associated with educational disadvantage if the family lives in an area with large concentrations of poor families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) States with large populations of high poverty students would receive significantly more funding if more funds under this part were allocated through the Targeted Grant Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Congress has an obligation to allocate funds under this part so that such funds will positively affect the largest number of economically disadvantaged students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on allocation of subchapter I funds contingent on adequate funding of targeted grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to section 6332 of this title, the total amount allocated in any fiscal year after fiscal year 2001 for programs and activities under this part shall not exceed the amount allocated in fiscal year 2001 for such programs and activities unless the amount available for targeted grants to local educational agencies under section 6335 of this title in the applicable fiscal year meets the requirements of section 6332(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall reallocate such excess funds to other States whose grants under this part would otherwise be insufficient to provide an appropriate level of services to migratory children, in such amounts as the Secretary determines are appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consortium arrangements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a State that receives a grant of $1,000,000 or less under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the State educational agency to determine whether consortium arrangements with another State or other appropriate entity would result in delivery of services in a more effective and efficient manner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to determine the estimated number of migratory children residing in each State for purposes of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use such information as the Secretary finds most accurately reflects the actual number of migratory children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop and implement a procedure for more accurately reflecting cost factors for different types of summer and intersession program designs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) adjust the full-time equivalent number of migratory children who reside in each State to take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the special needs of those children participating in special programs provided under this part that operate during the summer and intersession periods; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to build on the many benefits of advanced placement programs for students, which benefits may include the acquisition of skills that are important to many employers, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores that are 100 points above the national averages, and the achievement of better grades in secondary school and in college than the grades of students who have not participated in the programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to increase the availability and broaden the range of schools, including middle schools, that have advanced placement and pre-advanced placement programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to demonstrate that larger and more diverse groups of students can participate and succeed in advanced placement programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to provide greater access to advanced placement and pre-advanced placement courses and highly trained teachers for low-income and other disadvantaged students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to provide access to advanced placement courses for secondary school students at schools that do not offer advanced placement programs, increase the rate at which secondary school students participate in advanced placement courses, and increase the numbers of students who receive advanced placement test scores for which college academic credit is awarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to increase the participation of low-income individuals in taking advanced placement tests through the payment or partial payment of the costs of the advanced placement test fees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) to increase the number of individuals that achieve a baccalaureate or advanced degree, and to decrease the amount of time such individuals require to attain such degrees.</p>

For the purpose of the prohibition in subsection (c) of this section, the term &ldquo;person&rdquo;, as used in this paragraph, shall mean the head of the applicable Federal agency or the contractor of such agency providing the services to children.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7183_1_target" name="7183_1">1</a></sup> such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Modification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may, as appropriate, compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty or administrative compliance order.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Petition for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person aggrieved by a penalty assessed or an order issued, or both, by the Secretary under this section may file a petition for judicial review of the order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which the person resides or transacts business. Such person shall provide a copy of the petition to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. The petition shall be filed within 30 days after the Secretary's assessment or order, or both, are final and have been provided to such person by certified mail. The Secretary shall promptly provide to the court a certified copy of the transcript of any hearing held under this section and a copy of the notice or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Failure to comply</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this part are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To support local education reform efforts that are consistent with and support statewide education reform efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To provide funding to enable State educational agencies and local educational agencies to implement promising educational reform programs and school improvement programs based on scientifically based research.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To provide a continuing source of innovation and educational improvement, including support programs to provide library services and instructional and media materials.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To meet the educational needs of all students, including at-risk youth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To develop and implement education programs to improve school, student, and teacher performance, including professional development activities and class size reduction programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State and local responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State educational agency shall bear the basic responsibility for the administration of funds made available under this part, but it is the intent of Congress that the responsibility be carried out with a minimum of paperwork and that the responsibility for the design and implementation of programs assisted under this part be mainly that of local educational agencies, school superintendents and principals, and classroom teachers and supporting personnel, because local educational agencies and individuals have the most direct contact with students and are most likely to be able to design programs to meet the educational needs of students in their own school districts.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Distribution rule</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allocation of base amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the amount made available to a State educational agency under this part for a fiscal year, the State educational agency shall distribute, to local educational agencies within the State, an amount that is not less than 85 percent of the amount made available to the State educational agency under this part for fiscal year 2002, according to the relative enrollments in public and in private nonprofit schools within the jurisdictions of such local educational agencies, adjusted, in accordance with criteria approved by the Secretary, to provide higher per-pupil allocations to local educational agencies that have the greatest numbers or percentages of children whose education imposes a higher-than-average cost per child, such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) children living in areas with high concentrations of economically disadvantaged families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) children from economically disadvantaged families; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the amount made available to a State educational agency under this part for a fiscal year that exceeds the amount made available to the agency under this part for fiscal year 2002, the State educational agency shall distribute 100 percent (or, in the case of a State educational agency receiving a minimum allotment under section 7211(a) of this title, not less than 50 percent, notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section) to local educational agencies within the State, on the same basis as the State educational agency distributes amounts under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations and requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not more than 15 percent of funds made available under section 7211 of this title for State programs under this part for any fiscal year may be used for State administration under section 7213 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Calculation of enrollments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The calculation of relative enrollments under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be on the basis of the total of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of children enrolled in public schools; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of children enrolled in private nonprofit schools that participated in programs assisted under this part, for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the responsibility of each local educational agency to contact, on an annual basis, appropriate officials from private nonprofit schools within the areas served by such agencies in order to determine whether such schools desire that their children participate in programs assisted under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) State criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Relative enrollments calculated under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be adjusted, in accordance with criteria approved by the Secretary under subparagraph (B), to provide higher per-pupil allocations only to local educational agencies that serve the greatest numbers or percentages of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) children living in areas with high concentrations of economically disadvantaged families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) children from economically disadvantaged families; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) children living in sparsely populated areas.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Review of criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall review criteria submitted by a State educational agency for adjusting allocations under paragraph (1) and shall approve such criteria only if the Secretary determines that such criteria are reasonably calculated to produce an adjusted <!-- PDFPage:1388 -->allocation that reflects the relative needs of the State's local educational agencies based on the factors set forth in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of allocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the funds paid to a State educational agency under this subpart for a fiscal year, the State educational agency shall distribute to each eligible local educational agency that has submitted an application as required by section 7215b of this title the amount of such local educational agency's allocation, as determined under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Additional funds resulting from higher per-pupil allocations provided to a local educational agency on the basis of adjusted enrollments of children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section may, in the discretion of the local educational agency, be allocated for expenditures to provide services for children enrolled in public schools and private nonprofit schools in direct proportion to the number of children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and enrolled in such schools within the area served by the local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any fiscal year, any local educational agency that elects to allocate such additional funds in the manner described in subparagraph (A) shall allocate all additional funds to schools within the area served by the local educational agency in such manner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B) may not be construed to require any school to limit the use of the additional funds described in subparagraph (A) to the provision of services to specific students or categories of students.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other provisions for services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no program is carried out under paragraph (1) in the school district of a local educational agency, the State educational agency shall make arrangements, such as through contracts with nonprofit agencies or organizations, under which children in private schools in the district are provided with services and materials to the same extent as would have occurred if the local educational agency had received funds under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of this section relating to the participation of children, teachers, and other personnel serving such children shall apply to programs carried out under this part by a State educational agency or local educational agency, whether directly or through grants to, or contracts with, other public or private agencies, institutions, or organizations.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Provision of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Services provided under this part shall be provided by employees of a public agency or through contract by such a public agency with a person, association, agency, or corporation that, in the provision of such services, is independent of the private school and of any religious organizations, and such employment or contract shall be under the control and supervision of such a public agency. The funds provided under this part shall not be commingled with State or local funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State educational agency or local educational agency is prohibited, by reason of any provision of law, from providing for the participation in programs of children enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools as required by subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the Secretary shall waive such requirements for the agency involved and shall arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements that shall be subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a State educational agency or a local educational agency has substantially failed, or is unwilling, to provide for the participation on an equitable basis of children enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools as required by subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the Secretary may waive such requirements and shall arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements that shall be subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Withholding of allotment or allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pending final resolution of any investigation or complaint that could result in a waiver under subsection (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the Secretary may withhold from the allotment or allocation of the affected State educational agency or local educational agency the amount estimated by the Secretary to be necessary to pay the cost of services to be provided by the Secretary under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Duration of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any determination by the Secretary under this section shall continue in effect until the Secretary determines that there will no longer be any failure or inability on the part of the State educational agency or local educational agency to meet the requirements of subsections (a) through (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment from State allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the Secretary arranges for services under subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall, after consultation with the appropriate public school and private school officials, pay the cost of such services, including the administrative costs of arranging for those services, from the appropriate allotment of the State educational agency under this part.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1393 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Review of determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Written objections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall not take any final action under this section until the State educational agency and the local educational agency affected by such action have had an opportunity, for not less than 45 days after receiving written notice thereof, to submit written objections and to appear before the Secretary or the Secretary's designee to show cause why that action should not be taken.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Court action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State educational agency or local educational agency is dissatisfied with the Secretary's final action after a proceeding under paragraph (1), such agency may, not later than 60 days after notice of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of that action. A copy of the petition shall be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which the Secretary based the action, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remand to Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The findings of fact by the Secretary with respect to a proceeding under paragraph (1), if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. The court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence and the Secretary may make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive, if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Court review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the filing of a petition under paragraph (2), the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set such action aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari or certification, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Magnet schools are a significant part of the Nation's effort to achieve voluntary desegregation in our Nation's schools.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The use of magnet schools has increased dramatically since the inception of the magnet schools assistance program under this chapter, with approximately 2,000,000 students nationwide attending such schools, of whom more than 65 percent are non-white.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Magnet schools offer a wide range of distinctive programs that have served as models for school improvement efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It is in the best interests of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to continue the Federal Government's support of local educational agencies that are implementing court-ordered desegregation plans and local educational agencies that are voluntarily seeking to foster meaningful interaction among students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, beginning at the earliest stage of such students&rsquo; education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to ensure that all students have equitable access to a high quality education that will prepare all students to function well in a technologically oriented and a highly competitive economy comprised of people from many different racial and ethnic backgrounds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to continue to desegregate and diversify schools by supporting magnet schools, recognizing that segregation exists between minority and nonminority students as well as among students of different minority groups.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Desegregation efforts through magnet school programs are a significant part of our Nation's effort to achieve voluntary desegregation in schools and help to ensure equal educational opportunities for all students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this part is to assist in the desegregation of schools served by local educational agencies by providing financial assistance to eligible local educational agencies for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the elimination, reduction, or prevention of minority group isolation in elementary schools and secondary schools with substantial proportions of minority students, which shall include assisting in the efforts of the United States to achieve voluntary desegregation in public schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the development and implementation of magnet school programs that will assist local educational agencies in achieving systemic reforms and providing all students the opportunity to meet challenging State academic content standards and student academic achievement standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the development and design of innovative educational methods and practices that promote diversity and increase choices in public elementary schools and public secondary schools and public educational programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) courses of instruction within magnet schools that will substantially strengthen the knowledge of academic subjects and the attainment of tangible and marketable vocational, technological, and professional skills of students attending such schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) improving the capacity of local educational agencies, including through professional development, to continue operating magnet schools at a high performance level after Federal funding for the magnet schools is terminated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensuring that all students enrolled in the magnet school programs have equitable access to high quality education that will enable the students to succeed academically and continue with postsecondary education or productive employment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians have been linked for over 200 years to the coastal towns of Salem, Massachusetts, and New Bedford, Massachusetts, through the China trade from Salem and whaling voyages from New Bedford.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Nineteenth-century trading ships sailed from Salem, Massachusetts, around Cape Horn of South America, and up the Northwest coast of the United States to Alaska, where their crews traded with Alaska Native people for furs, and then went on to Hawaii to trade for sandalwood with Native Hawaiians before going on to China.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) During the 19th century, over 2,000 whaling voyages sailed out of New Bedford, Massachusetts to the Arctic region of Alaska, and joined Alaska Natives from Barrow, Alaska and other areas in the Arctic region in subsistence whaling activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Many New Bedford whaling voyages continued on to Hawaii, where they joined Native Hawaiians from the neighboring islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) From those commercial and whaling voyages, a rich cultural exchange and strong trading relationships developed among the three peoples involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In the past decades, awareness of the historical trading, cultural, and whaling links has faded among Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and the people of the continental United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In 2000, the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Alaska, the Bishop Museum in Hawaii, and the Peabody-Essex Museum in Massachusetts initiated the New Trade Winds project to use 21st-century technology, including the Internet, to educate students and their parents about historic and contemporary cultural and trading ties that continue to link the diverse cultures of the peoples involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The New Bedford Whaling Museum, in partnership with the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park, has developed a cultural exchange and educational program with the Inupiat Heritage Center in Barrow, Alaska to bring together the children, parents, and elders from the Arctic region of Alaska with children and families of Massachusetts to learn about their historical ties and about each other's contemporary cultures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Within the fast-growing cultural sector, meaningful educational and career opportunities based on traditional relationships exist for Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and low-income youth in Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Cultural institutions can provide practical, culturally relevant, education-related internship and apprentice programs, such as the Museum Action Corps at the Peabody-Essex Museum and similar programs at the New Bedford Oceanarium and other institutions, to prepare youths and their families for careers in the cultural sector.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The resources of the institutions described in paragraphs (7) and (8) provide unique opportunities for illustrating and interpreting the contributions of Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, the whaling industry, and the China trade to the economic, social, and environmental history of the United States, for educating students and their parents, and for providing opportunities for internships and apprenticeships leading to careers with cultural institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subpart are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To authorize and develop innovative culturally-based educational programs and cultural exchanges to assist Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and children and families of Massachusetts linked by history and tradition to Alaska and Hawaii to learn about shared culture and traditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To authorize and develop internship and apprentice programs to assist Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and children and families of Massachusetts linked by history and tradition with Alaska and Hawaii to prepare for careers with cultural institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To supplement programs and authorities in the area of education to further the objectives of this subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To authorize and develop cultural and educational programs relating to any Federally recognized Indian tribe in Mississippi.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This subpart may be cited as the &ldquo;Women's Educational Equity Act of 2001&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) since the enactment of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], women and girls have made strides in educational achievement and in their ability to avail themselves of educational opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of funding provided under the Women's Educational Equity Act of 2001 [20 U.S.C. 7283 et seq.], more curricula, training, and other educational materials concerning educational equity for women and girls are available for national dissemination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) teaching and learning practices in the United States are frequently inequitable as such practices relate to women and girls, for example&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sexual harassment, particularly that experienced by girls, undermines the ability of schools to provide a safe and equitable learning or workplace environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) classroom textbooks and other educational materials do not sufficiently reflect the experiences, achievements, or concerns of women and, in most cases, are not written by women or persons of color;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) girls do not take as many mathematics and science courses as boys, girls lose confidence in their mathematics and science ability as girls move through adolescence, and there are few women role models in the sciences; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) pregnant and parenting teenagers are at high risk for dropping out of school and existing dropout prevention programs do not adequately address the needs of such teenagers;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) efforts to improve the quality of public education also must include efforts to ensure equal access to quality education programs for all women and girls;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Federal support should address not only research and development of innovative model curricula and teaching and learning strategies to promote gender equity, but should also assist schools and local communities implement gender equitable practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Federal assistance for gender equity must be tied to systemic reform, involve collaborative efforts to implement effective gender practices at the local level, and encourage parental participation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) excellence in education, high educational achievements and standards, and the full participation of women and girls in American society, cannot be achieved without educational equity for women and girls.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to recognize the unique educational and culturally related academic needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students consistent with the unique political and legal relationship of the Federal Government with tribal governments, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Purpose</em>. The United States has a unique legal relationship with Indian tribes and a special relationship with Alaska Native entities as provided in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, and Federal statutes. This Administration is committed to continuing to work with these Federally recognized tribal governments on a government-to-government basis, and supports tribal sovereignty and self-determination. It is the purpose of this order to assist American Indian and Alaska Native students in meeting the challenging student academic standards of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107&ndash;110 [see Tables for classification]) in a manner that is consistent with tribal traditions, languages, and cultures. This order builds on the innovations, reforms, and high standards of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, including: stronger accountability for results; greater flexibility in the use of Federal funds; more choices for parents; and an emphasis on research-based instruction that works.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Interagency Working Group</em>. There is established an Interagency Working Group on American Indian and Alaska Native Education (Working Group) to oversee the implementation of this order.</p>

The Working Group shall be led by the Secretaries of Education and the Interior, or their designees under this section, who shall serve as Co-Chairs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The function of the Working Group is to oversee the implementation of this order. The Working Group shall, within 90 days of the date of this order, develop a Federal interagency plan that recommends initiatives, strategies, and ideas for future interagency actions that promote the purpose, as stated in section 1, of this order. In carrying out its activities under this order, the Working Group may consult with representatives of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and organizations, in conformity with Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000 [25 U.S.C. 450 note], and with the National Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE).

The Secretary shall notify the local educational agency of the amount of the payment not later than June 1 of the year for which the Secretary makes the payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments taken into account by the State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not make a grant under this subpart to a local educational agency for a fiscal year if, for such fiscal year, the State in which the local educational agency is located takes into consideration payments made under this chapter&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7428_1_target" name="7428_1">1</a></sup> in determining the eligibility of the local educational agency for State aid, or the amount of the State aid, with respect to the free public education of children during such fiscal year or the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduction of payment for failure to maintain fiscal effort</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not pay a local educational agency the full amount of a grant award determined under section 7423 of this title for any fiscal year unless the State educational agency notifies the Secretary, and the Secretary determines, that with respect to the provision of free public education by the local educational agency for the preceding fiscal year, the combined fiscal effort of the local educational agency and the State, computed on either a per student or aggregate expenditure basis, was not less than 90 percent of the amount of the combined fiscal effort, computed on the same basis, for the second preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Failure to maintain effort</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, for the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary determines that a local educational agency and State failed to maintain the combined fiscal effort for such agency at the level specified in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reduce the amount of the grant that would otherwise be made to such agency under this subpart in the exact proportion of the failure to maintain the fiscal effort at such level; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not use the reduced amount of the agency and State expenditures for the preceding year to determine compliance with paragraph (1) for any succeeding fiscal year, but shall use the amount of expenditures that would have been required to comply with paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Waiver</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (1) for a local educational agency, for not more than 1 year at a time, if the Secretary determines that the failure to comply with such requirement is due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the agency's financial resources.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Future determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall not use the reduced amount of the agency's expenditures for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which a waiver is granted to determine compliance with paragraph (1) for any succeeding fiscal year, but shall use the amount of expenditures that would have been required to comply with paragraph (1) in the absence of the waiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may reallocate, in a manner that the Secretary determines will best carry out the purpose of this subpart, any amounts that&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7512. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was organized as a nation and internationally recognized as a nation by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and navigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous people in Hawaii in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawaii.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom of Hawaii to govern friendship, commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally recognized, and indigenous government of Hawaii, the Kingdom of Hawaii, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, including United States citizens, who were assisted in their efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. Because of the participation of United States agents and citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in 1993 the United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination through Public Law 103&ndash;150 (107 Stat. 1510).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled &ldquo;Joint Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States&rdquo;, approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of Hawaii, including the government and crown lands of the former Kingdom of Hawaii, to the United States, but mandated that revenue generated from the lands be used &ldquo;solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, and in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: &ldquo;One thing that impressed me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was the fact that the natives of the island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in poverty.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b&ndash;1, 392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit fishing in the area &ldquo;only by native Hawaiian residents of said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their guidance.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Under the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union&rdquo;, approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments to such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union&rdquo;, the United States also ceded to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands formerly held by the United States, but mandated that such lands be held by the State &ldquo;in public trust&rdquo; and reaffirmed the special relationship that existed between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the legal responsibility to enforce the public trust responsibility of the State of Hawaii for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to administer a portion of the Fed<!-- PDFPage:1479 -->eral trust responsibility to the State of Hawaii;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United States have&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal affairs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-governance that has never been extinguished.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) The political relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the inclusion of Native Hawaiians in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 2991 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. 1996[, 1996a]);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 U.S.C. 80q et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the Native American Languages Act (25 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Culture and Art Development Act (20 U.S.C. 4401 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Education to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native Hawaiian education. The report, entitled the &ldquo;Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Project&rdquo;, was released in 1983 and documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests, were disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics indicative of special educational needs, and had educational needs that were related to their unique cultural situation, such as different learning styles and low self-image.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) In recognition of the educational needs of Native Hawaiians, in 1988, Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988 (102 Stat. 130) to authorize and develop supplemental educational programs to address the unique conditions of Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) In 1993, the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate released a 10-year update of findings of the Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the successes of the programs established under title IV of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the same educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians. Subsequent reports by the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate and other organizations have generally confirmed those findings. For example&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) educational risk factors continue to start even before birth for many Native Hawaiian children, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) late or no prenatal care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) high rates of births by Native Hawaiian women who are unmarried; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) high rates of births to teenage parents;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their school experience lagging behind other students in terms of readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score below national norms on standardized education achievement tests at all grade levels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) both public and private schools continue to show a pattern of lower percentages of Native Hawaiian students in the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be overrepresented among students qualifying for special education programs provided to students with learning disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional impairment, and other such disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepresented in institutions of higher education and among adults who have completed four or more years of college;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Native Hawaiians continue to be disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics indicative of special educational needs, as demonstrated by the fact that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be retained in grade level and to be excessively absent in secondary school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Native Hawaiian students have the highest rates of drug and alcohol use in the State of Hawaii; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Native Hawaiian children continue to be disproportionately victimized by child abuse and neglect; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 percent of the students served by the State of Hawaii Department of Education, and there are and will continue to be geographically rural, isolated areas with a high Native Hawaiian population density.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) In the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress, Hawaiian fourth-graders ranked 39th among groups of students from 39 States in reading. Given that Hawaiian students rank among the lowest groups of students nationally in reading, and that Native Hawaiian students rank the lowest among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative that greater focus be placed on beginning reading and early education and literacy in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) The findings described in paragraphs (16) and (17) are inconsistent with the high rates of literacy and integration of traditional culture and Western education historically achieved by Native Hawaiians through a Hawaiian language-based public school system established in 1840 by Kamehameha III.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1480 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) Following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893, Hawaiian medium schools were banned. After annexation, throughout the territorial and statehood period of Hawaii, and until 1986, use of the Hawaiian language as an instructional medium in education in public schools was declared unlawful. The declaration caused incalculable harm to a culture that placed a very high value on the power of language, as exemplified in the traditional saying: &ldquo;I ka &lsquo;&#333;lelo n&#333; ke ola; I ka &lsquo;&#333;lelo n&#333; ka make. In the language rests life; In the language rests death.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) Despite the consequences of over 100 years of nonindigenous influence, the Native Hawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory and their cultural identity in accordance with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) The State of Hawaii, in the constitution and statutes of the State of Hawaii&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reaffirms and protects the unique right of the Native Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their culture and religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) recognizes the traditional language of the Native Hawaiian people as an official language of the State of Hawaii, which may be used as the language of instruction for all subjects and grades in the public school system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promotes the study of the Hawaiian culture, language, and history by providing a Hawaiian education program and using community expertise as a suitable and essential means to further the program.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The attainment of educational success is critical to the betterment of the conditions, long-term well-being, and preservation of the culture of Alaska Natives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage the maximum participation by Alaska Natives in the planning and the management of Alaska Native education programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Alaska Native children enter and exit school with serious educational handicaps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The educational achievement of Alaska Native children is far below national norms. Native performance on standardized tests is low, Native student dropout rates are high, and Natives are significantly underrepresented among holders of baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska. As a result, Native students are being denied their opportunity to become full participants in society by grade school and high school educations that are condemning an entire generation to an underclass status and a life of limited choices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The programs authorized in this part, combined with expanded Head Start, infant learning, and early childhood education programs, and parent education programs, are essential if educational handicaps are to be overcome.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic barriers to be overcome in delivering edu<!-- PDFPage:1485 -->cational services in rural Alaska and Alaska villages should be addressed through the development and implementation of innovative, model programs in a variety of areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Native children should be afforded the opportunity to begin their formal education on a par with their non-Native peers. The Federal Government should lend support to efforts developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for all students.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to fulfill the Federal responsibility to assist with the provision of educational services to federally connected children in a manner that promotes control by local educational agencies with little or no Federal or State involvement, because certain activities of the Federal Government, such as activities to fulfill the responsibilities of the Federal Government with respect to Indian tribes and activities under section 571 of title 50, Appendix, place a financial burden on the local educational agencies serving areas where such activities are carried out, and to help such children meet challenging State standards, it is the purpose of this subchapter to provide financial assistance to local educational agencies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) experience a substantial and continuing financial burden due to the acquisition of real property by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) educate children who reside on Federal property and whose parents are employed on Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) educate children of parents who are in the military services and children who live in low-rent housing;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) need special assistance with capital expenditures for construction activities because of the enrollments of substantial numbers of children who reside on Federal lands and because of the difficulty of raising local revenue through bond referendums for capital projects due to the inability to tax Federal property.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Computation of payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b) or (d) of this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of children who were in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding school year and who, while in attendance at such schools&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) resided on Federal property with a parent employed on Federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the school district of such agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) resided on Federal property with a parent who is an official of, and accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) resided on Indian lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined by section 101 of title 37) but did not reside on Federal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) had a parent who is an official of, and has been accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer but did not reside on Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) resided in low-rent housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) resided on Federal property and is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) resided with a parent employed on Federal property situated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in whole or in part in the county in which such agency is located, or in whole or in part in such agency if such agency is located in more than one county; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if not in such county, in whole or in part in the same State as such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of weighted student units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 6,500; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 1,000 or such number equals or exceeds 10 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Military installation and Indian housing undergoing renovation or rebuilding</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of computing the amount of a payment for a local educational agency for children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i), the Secretary shall consider such children to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of Defense, that such children would have resided in housing on Federal property in accordance with paragraph (1)(B) except that such housing was undergoing renovation or rebuilding on the date for which the Secretary determines the number of children under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of computing the amount of a payment for a local educational agency that received a payment for children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local edu<!-- PDFPage:1494 -->cational agency is making an application, the Secretary shall consider such children to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that such children would have resided in housing on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) except that such housing was undergoing renovation or rebuilding on the date for which the Secretary determines the number of children under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i)(I) Children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i) may be deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to housing on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) for a period not to exceed 3 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The number of children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i) who are deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to housing on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) for any fiscal year may not exceed the maximum number of children who are expected to occupy that housing upon completion of the renovation or rebuilding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii)(I) Children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application may be deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) with respect to housing on Indian lands undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) for a period not to exceed 3 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The number of children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application who are deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) with respect to housing on Indian lands undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) for any fiscal year may not exceed the maximum number of children who are expected to occupy that housing upon completion of the renovation or rebuilding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Military &ldquo;Build to Lease&rdquo; program housing</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of computing the amount of payment for a local educational agency for children identified under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider children residing in housing initially acquired or constructed under the former section 2828(g) of title 10 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Build to Lease&rdquo; program), as added by section 801 of the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1984, to be children described under paragraph (1)(B) if the property described is within the fenced security perimeter of the military facility upon which such housing is situated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the property described in subparagraph (A) is not owned by the Federal Government, is subject to taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State, and thereby generates revenues for a local educational agency that is applying to receive a payment under this section, then the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall require the local educational agency to provide certification from an appropriate official of the Department of Defense that the property is being used to provide military housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall reduce the amount of the payment under this section by an amount equal to the amount of revenue from such taxation received in the second preceding fiscal year by such local educational agency, unless the amount of such revenue was taken into account by the State for such second preceding fiscal year and already resulted in a reduction in the amount of State aid paid to such local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basic support payments; insufficient appropriations; State with only one local educational agency</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basic support payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at least 400 such children; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1495 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located, multiplied by the local contribution percentage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If satisfactory data from the third preceding fiscal year are not available for any of the expenditures described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall use data from the most recent fiscal year for which data that are satisfactory to the Secretary are available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining the comparable local contribution rate under subparagraph (C)(iii) for a local educational agency described in section 222.39(c)(3) of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, that had its comparable local contribution rate for fiscal year 1998 calculated pursuant to section 222.39 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, the Secretary shall determine such comparable local contribution rate as the rate upon which payments under this subsection for fiscal year 2000 were made to the local educational agency adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in the per pupil expenditure in the State serving the local educational agency calculated on the basis of the second most recent preceding school year compared to the third most recent preceding school year for which school year data are available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Increase in local contribution rate due to unusual geographic factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subparagraph (C) are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency under subparagraph (C)(iii) by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Beginning with fiscal year 2002, for the purpose of calculating a payment under this paragraph for a local educational agency whose local contribution rate was computed under subparagraph (C)(iii) for the previous year, the Secretary shall use a local contribution rate that is not less than 95 percent of the rate that the LEA received for the preceding year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basic support payments for heavily impacted local educational agencies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible heavily impacted local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A local educational agency that receives a basic support payment under this paragraph for a fiscal year shall not be eligible to receive a basic support payment under paragraph (1) for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility for continuing heavily impacted local educational agencies</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a State may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider payments under this subchapter in determining for any fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the eligibility of a local educational agency for State aid for free public education; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of such aid; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make such aid available to local educational agencies in a manner that results in less State aid to any local educational agency that is eligible for such payment than such agency would receive if such agency were not so eligible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State equalization plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may reduce State aid to a local educational agency that receives a payment under section 7702 or 7703(b) of this title (except the amount calculated in excess of 1.0 under section 7703(a)(2)(B) of this title and, with respect to a local educational agency that receives a payment under section 7703(b)(2) of this title, the amount in excess of the amount that the agency would receive if the agency were deemed to be an agency eligible to receive a payment under section 7703(b)(1) of this title and not section 7703(b)(2) of this title) for any fiscal year if the Secretary determines, and certifies under subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section, that the State has in effect a program of State aid that equalizes expenditures for free public education among local educational agencies in the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local educational agencies if, in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the amount of per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the highest such per-pupil expenditures or revenues did not exceed the amount of such per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the <!-- PDFPage:1513 -->State with the lowest such expenditures or revenues by more than 25 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) take into account the extent to which a program of State aid reflects the additional cost of providing free public education in particular types of local educational agencies, such as those that are geographically isolated, or to particular types of students, such as children with disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State has substantially revised its program of State aid, the Secretary may certify such program for any fiscal year only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary determines, on the basis of projected data, that the State's program will meet the disparity standard described in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State provides an assurance to the Secretary that, if final data do not demonstrate that the State's program met such standard for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the State will pay to each affected local educational agency the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures for review of State equalization plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Written notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any State that wishes to consider payments described in subsection (b)(1) of this section in providing State aid to local educational agencies shall submit to the Secretary, not later than 120 days before the beginning of the State's fiscal year, a written notice of such State's intention to do so.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such notice shall be in the form and contain the information the Secretary requires, including evidence that the State has notified each local educational agency in the State of such State's intention to consider such payments in providing State aid.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to present views</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before making a determination under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall afford the State, and local educational agencies in the State, an opportunity to present their views.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualification procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a program of State aid qualifies under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certify the program and so notify the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) afford an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with section 7711(a) of this title, to any local educational agency adversely affected by such certification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Nonqualification procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a program of State aid does not qualify under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) so notify the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) afford an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with section 7711(a) of this title, to the State, and to any local educational agency adversely affected by such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of State aid</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State has in effect a program of State aid for free public education for any fiscal year, which is designed to equalize expenditures for free public education among the local educational agencies of that State, payments under this subchapter for any fiscal year may be taken into consideration by such State in determining the relative&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) financial resources available to local educational agencies in that State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) financial need of such agencies for the provision of free public education for children served by such agency, except that a State may consider as local resources funds received under this subchapter only in proportion to the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may not take into consideration payments under this subchapter before such State's program of State aid has been certified by the Secretary under subsection (c)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Remedies for State violations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary or any aggrieved local educational agency may, not earlier than 150 days after an adverse determination by the Secretary against a State for violation of subsections (a) or (d)(2) of this section or for failure to carry out an assurance under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, and if an administrative proceeding has not been concluded within such time, bring an action in a United States district court against such State for such violations or failure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Immunity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State shall not be immune under the 11th amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The court shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.</p>
