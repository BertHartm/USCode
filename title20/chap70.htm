<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6301. Declaration of policy and statement of purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Statement of policy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress declares it to be the policy of the United States that a high-quality education for all individuals and a fair and equal opportunity to obtain that education are a societal good, are a moral imperative, and improve the life of every individual, because the quality of our individual lives ultimately depends on the quality of the lives of others.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress further declares it to be the policy of the United States to expand the program authorized by this subchapter over the fiscal years 1996 through 1999 by increasing funding for this subchapter by at least $750,000,000 over baseline each fiscal year and thereby increasing the percentage of eligible children served in each fiscal year with the intent of serving all eligible children by fiscal year 2004.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recognition of need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) although the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and other children has been reduced by half over the past two decades, a sizable gap remains, and many segments of our society lack the opportunity to become well educated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the most urgent need for educational improvement is in schools with high concentrations of children from low-income families and achieving the National Education Goals will not be possible without substantial improvement in such schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) educational needs are particularly great for low-achieving children in our Nation's highest-poverty schools, children with limited English proficiency, children of migrant workers, children with disabilities, Indian children, children who are neglected or delinquent, and young children and their parents who are in need of family-literacy services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) while this subchapter and other programs funded under this chapter contribute to narrowing the achievement gap between children in high-poverty and low-poverty schools, such programs need to become even more effective in improving schools in order to enable all children to achieve high standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in order for all students to master challenging standards in core academic subjects as described in the third National Education Goal described in section 5812(3) of this title, students and schools will need to maximize the time spent on teaching and learning the core academic subjects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) What has been learned since 1988</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To enable schools to provide all children a high-quality education, this subchapter builds upon the following learned information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) All children can master challenging content and complex problem-solving skills. Research clearly shows that children, including low-achieving children, can succeed when expectations are high and all children are given the opportunity to learn challenging material.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Conditions outside the classroom such as hunger, unsafe living conditions, homelessness, unemployment, violence, inadequate health care, child abuse, and drug and alcohol abuse can adversely affect children's academic achievement and must be addressed through the coordination of services, such as health and social services, in order for the Nation to meet the National Education Goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Use of low-level tests that are not aligned with schools&rsquo; curricula fails to provide adequate information about what children know and can do and encourages curricula and instruction that focus on the low-level skills measured by such tests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Resources are more effective when resources are used to ensure that children have full access to effective high-quality regular school programs and receive supplemental help through extended-time activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Intensive and sustained professional development for teachers and other school staff, focused on teaching and learning and on helping children attain high standards, is too often not provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Insufficient attention and resources are directed toward the effective use of technology in schools and the role technology can play in professional development and improved teaching and learning.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1033 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) All parents can contribute to their children's success by helping at home and becoming partners with teachers so that children can achieve high standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Decentralized decisionmaking is a key ingredient of systemic reform. Schools need the resources, flexibility, and authority to design and implement effective strategies for bringing their children to high levels of performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Opportunities for students to achieve high standards can be enhanced through a variety of approaches such as public school choice and public charter schools.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Attention to academics alone cannot ensure that all children will reach high standards. The health and other needs of children that affect learning are frequently unmet, particularly in high-poverty schools, thereby necessitating coordination of services to better meet children's needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Resources provided under this subchapter can be better targeted on the highest-poverty local educational agencies and schools that have children most in need.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Equitable and sufficient resources, particularly as such resources relate to the quality of the teaching force, have an integral relationship to high student achievement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Statement of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to enable schools to provide opportunities for children served to acquire the knowledge and skills contained in the challenging State content standards and to meet the challenging State performance standards developed for all children. This purpose shall be accomplished by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensuring high standards for all children and aligning the efforts of States, local educational agencies, and schools to help children served under this subchapter to reach such standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing children an enriched and accelerated educational program, including, when appropriate, the use of the arts, through schoolwide programs or through additional services that increase the amount and quality of instructional time so that children served under this subchapter receive at least the classroom instruction that other children receive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) promoting schoolwide reform and ensuring access of children (from the earliest grades) to effective instructional strategies and challenging academic content that includes intensive complex thinking and problem-solving experiences;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) significantly upgrading the quality of instruction by providing staff in participating schools with substantial opportunities for professional development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) coordinating services under all parts of this subchapter with each other, with other educational services, and, to the extent feasible, with health and social service programs funded from other sources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) affording parents meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at home and at school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) distributing resources, in amounts sufficient to make a difference, to areas and schools where needs are greatest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) improving accountability, as well as teaching and learning, by using State assessment systems designed to measure how well children served under this subchapter are achieving challenging State student performance standards expected of all children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) providing greater decisionmaking authority and flexibility to schools and teachers in exchange for greater responsibility for student performance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a State has State content standards or State student performance standards developed under title III of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5881 et seq.] and an aligned set of assessments for all students developed under such title, or, if not developed under such title, adopted under another process, the State shall use such standards and assessments, modified, if necessary, to conform with the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (D) of this paragraph, and paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If a State has not adopted State content standards and State student performance standards for all students, the State plan shall include a strategy and schedule for developing State content standards and State student performance standards for elementary and secondary school children served under this part in subjects as determined by the State, but including at least mathematics and reading or <!-- PDFPage:1036 -->language arts by the end of the one-year period described in paragraph (6), which standards shall include the same knowledge, skills, and levels of performance expected of all children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Standards under this paragraph shall include&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) For the subjects in which students will be served under this part, but for which a State is not required by subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to develop, and has not otherwise developed such standards, the State plan shall describe a strategy for ensuring that such students are taught the same knowledge and skills and held to the same expectations as are all children.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall use funds received under this part only in eligible school attendance areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible school attendance areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the term &ldquo;school attendance area&rdquo; means, in relation to a particular school, the geographical area in which the children who are normally served by that school reside; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the term &ldquo;eligible school attendance area&rdquo; means a school attendance area in which the percentage of children from low-income families is at least as high as the percentage of children from low-income families in the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Ranking order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds allocated in accordance with subsection (c) of this section are insufficient to serve all eligible school attendance areas, a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank, without regard to grade spans, such agency's eligible school attendance areas in which the concentration of children from low-income families exceeds 75 percent from highest to lowest according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Remaining funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds remain after serving all eligible school attendance areas under paragraph (3), a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank such agency's remaining eligible school attendance areas from highest to lowest either by grade span or for the entire local educational agency according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order either within each grade-span grouping or within the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agency shall use the same measure of poverty, which measure shall be the number of children ages 5 through 17 in poverty counted in the most recent census data approved by the Secretary, the number of children eligible for free and reduced priced lunches under the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], the number of children in families receiving assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], or the number of children eligible to receive medical assistance under the Medicaid program, or a composite of such indicators, with respect to all school attendance areas in the local educational agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to identify eligible school attendance areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to determine the ranking of each area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to determine allocations under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to a local educational agency with a total enrollment of less than 1,000 children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver for desegregation plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a local educational agency's written request for a waiver of the requirements of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, and permit such agency to treat as eligible, and serve, any school that children attend with a State-ordered or a court-ordered school desegregation plan or a plan that continues to be implemented in accordance with a State-ordered or court-ordered desegregation plan, if (A) the number of economically disadvantaged children enrolled in the school is at least 25 percent of the school's total enrollment; and (B) the Secretary determines on the basis of a written request from such agency and in accordance with such criteria as the Secretary establishes, that approval of that request would further the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Local educational agency discretion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, a local educational agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designate as eligible any school attendance area or school in which at least 35 percent of the children are from low-income families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) use funds received under this part in a school that is not in an eligible school attendance area, if the percentage of children from low-income families enrolled in the school is equal to or greater than the percentage of such children in a participating school attendance area of such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) elect not to serve an eligible school attendance area or eligible school that has a higher percentage of children from low-income families if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the school meets the comparability requirements of section 6322(c) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the school is receiving supplemental funds from other State or local sources that are spent according to the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the funds expended from such other sources equal or exceed the amount that would be provided under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(C), the number of children attending private elementary and secondary schools who are to receive services, and the assistance such children are to receive under this part, shall be determined without regard to whether the public school attendance area in which such children reside is assisted under paragraph (1).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1042 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall allocate funds received under this part to eligible school attendance areas or eligible schools, identified under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, in rank order, on the basis of the total number of children from low-income families in each area or school.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the per pupil amount of funds allocated to each school attendance area or school under paragraph (1) shall be at least 125 percent of the per pupil amount of funds a local educational agency received for that year under the poverty criteria described by the local educational agency in the plan submitted under section 6312 of this title, except that this paragraph shall not apply to a local educational agency that only serves schools in which the percentage of such children is 35 percent or greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A local educational agency may reduce the amount of funds allocated under subparagraph (A) for a school attendance area or school by the amount of any supplemental State and local funds expended in that school attendance area or school for programs that meet the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall reserve such funds as are necessary under this part to provide services comparable to those provided to children in schools funded under this part to serve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) where appropriate, eligible homeless children who do not attend participating schools, including providing educationally related support services to children in shelters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) children in local institutions for neglected or delinquent children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) where appropriate, neglected and delinquent children in community day school programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Each local educational agency receiving funds under this part shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use the State assessments described in the State plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) use any additional measures or indicators described in the local educational agency's plan to review annually the progress of each school served under this part to determine whether the school is meeting, or making adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(i) of this title toward enabling its students to meet the State's student performance standards described in the State plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) publicize and disseminate to teachers and other staff, parents, students, and the community, the results of the annual review under paragraph (2) of all schools served under this part in individual school performance profiles that include statistically sound disaggregated results as required by section 6311(b)(3)(I) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide the results of the local annual review to schools so that the schools can continually refine the program of instruction to help all children served under this part in those schools meet the State's student performance standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) this subparagraph shall not apply to a school if almost every student in such school is meeting the State's advanced level of performance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a targeted assistance school, such school may be reviewed on the progress of only those students that have been or are served under this part; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each school identified under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in consultation with parents, the local educational agency, and the school support team, develop or revise a school plan in ways that have the greatest likelihood of improving the performance of participating children in meeting the State's student performance standards; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before identifying a school for school improvement under paragraph (1), the local educational agency shall provide the school with an opportunity to review the school-level data, including assessment data, on which such identification is based. If the school believes that such identification for school improvement is in error for statistical or other substantive reasons, such school may provide evidence to the local educational agency to support such belief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) During the first year immediately following such identification, the school shall implement such school's plan or revised plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Professional development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each school identified under paragraph (1) shall, as part of the school plan under para<!-- PDFPage:1048 -->graph (2), improve the skills of its staff by providing effective professional development activities. A school shall demonstrate such school's compliance with this paragraph by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) devoting to such activities, over two consecutive years, an amount equivalent to at least 10 percent of the funds received by the school under this part during one fiscal year; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A school may use funds from any source to meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Decisions about how to use the funds made available under this part which the school makes available for professional development shall be made by teachers, principals, and other school staff in that school.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Technical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For each school identified under paragraph (1), the local educational agency shall provide technical or other assistance as the school develops and implements such school's plan or revised plan, such as a joint plan between the local educational agency and school that addresses specific elements of student performance problems and that specifies school and local educational agency responsibilities under the plan, and waivers or modifications of requirements of local educational agency policy or regulation that impede the ability of the school to educate students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such technical assistance may be provided directly by the local educational agency, through mechanisms authorized under section 6318 of this title, or with the local educational agency's approval, by an institution of higher education, a private nonprofit organization, an educational service agency, a comprehensive regional assistance center under part A of subchapter XIII of this chapter, or other entities with experience in helping schools improve achievement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Corrective action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), after providing technical assistance pursuant to paragraph (4) and taking other remediation measures, the local educational agency may take corrective action at any time against a school that has been identified under paragraph (1), but, during the third year following identification under paragraph (1), shall take such action against any school that still fails to make adequate progress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Corrective actions are those, consistent with State and local law, determined and made public and disseminated by the local educational agency, which may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) withholding funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) interagency collaborative agreements between the school and other public agencies to provide health, counseling, and other social services needed to remove barriers to learning;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(V) making alternative governance arrangements such as the creation of a public charter school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(VI) reconstituting the school staff; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(VII) authorizing students to transfer, including transportation costs, to other public schools served by the local educational agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), corrective actions taken pursuant to this part shall not include the actions described in subclause (I), (III), (IV), (VI), or (VII) of clause (i) until the State has developed assessments that meet the requirements of subparagraph (C) of section 6311(b)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Prior to implementing any corrective action, the local educational agency may refrain from such corrective action for one additional year to the extent that the failure to make progress can be attributed to extenuating circumstances as determined by the local educational agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A school that is no longer operating its schoolwide program due to a corrective action may not resume operation of such a program until the local educational agency determines that the school has adequately reformed its schoolwide program plan to enable the school to make adequate progress toward meeting the State's challenging student performance standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) State educational agency responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make technical assistance under section 6318 of this title available to the schools farthest from meeting the State's challenging student performance standards, if requested by the school or local educational agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if such agency determines that a local educational agency failed to carry out the local educational agency's responsibilities under paragraphs (4) and (5), take such corrective actions as the State educational agency deems appropriate and which are in compliance with State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Schools that, for at least two of the three years following identification under paragraph (1), make adequate progress toward meeting the State's proficient and advanced levels of performance shall no longer need to be identified for school improvement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State review and local educational agency improvement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually review the progress of each local educational agency receiving funds under this part to determine whether schools receiving assistance under this part are making adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title toward meeting the State's student performance standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) publicize and disseminate to local educational agencies, teachers and other staff, parents, students, and the community the <!-- PDFPage:1049 -->results of the State review, including statistically sound disaggregated results, as required by section 6311(b)(3)(I) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rewards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a local educational agency that for three consecutive years has met or exceeded the State's definition of adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title, the State may make institutional and individual rewards of the kinds described for individual schools in paragraph (2) of section 6318(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Identification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A State educational agency shall identify for improvement any local educational agency that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for two consecutive years, is not making adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title in schools served under this part toward meeting the State's student performance standards, except that schools served by the local educational agency that are operating targeted assistance programs may be reviewed on the basis of the progress of only those students served under this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) has failed to meet the criteria established by the State through such State's transitional procedure under section 6311(b)(7)(B) of this title for two consecutive years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before identifying a local educational agency for improvement under paragraph (1), the State educational agency shall provide the local educational agency with an opportunity to review the school-level data, including assessment data, on which such identification is based. If the local educational agency believes that such identification for improvement is in error due to statistical or other substantive reasons, such local educational agency may provide evidence to the State educational agency to support such belief.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Local educational agency revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each local educational agency identified under paragraph (3) shall, in consultation with schools, parents, and educational experts, revise its local educational agency plan under section 6312 of this title in ways that have the greatest likelihood of improving the performance of schools served by the local educational agency under this part in meeting the State's student performance standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such revision shall include determining why the local educational agency's plan failed to bring about increased achievement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) State educational agency responsibility</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State educational agency shall establish a statewide system of intensive and sustained support and improvement for schools receiving funds under this part, including schoolwide programs and schools in need of program improvement, in order to increase the opportunity for all students in such schools to meet the State's content standards and student performance standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Meeting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds reserved under section 6303(a) of this title or appropriated under section 6302(f) of this title shall be used to meet the requirements of this section. In addition to such funds a State educational agency may use State administrative funds reserved under section 6513(c) of this title to meet such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regional centers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such a statewide system shall work with and receive support and assistance from the comprehensive regional technical assistance centers under part A of subchapter XIII of this chapter and the educational regional laboratories under section 6041(h) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The system shall include at a minimum, the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) School support teams</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each State educational agency, in consultation with local educational agencies and schools, shall establish a system of school support teams to provide information and assistance to schoolwide programs and to assist such programs in providing an opportunity to all students to meet the State's student performance standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If funds are sufficient, school support teams shall provide information and assistance to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) schools&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) other schools in need of improvement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Each such team shall be composed of persons, including teachers, pupil services personnel, representatives of organizations knowledgeable about successful schoolwide projects or comprehensive school reform (especially distinguished educators described in paragraph (3)), and other persons who are knowledgeable about research and practice on teaching and learning, particularly about strategies for improving the educational opportunities <!-- PDFPage:1051 -->for low-achieving students (including alternative and applied learning), such as representatives of institutions of higher education, regional educational laboratories or research centers, and outside consultant groups.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A school support team shall work cooperatively with each school and make recommendations as the school develops the school's schoolwide program plan or school improvement plan, review each plan, and make recommendations to the school and the local educational agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each State shall designate as a distinguished school any school served under this part which, for three consecutive years, has exceeded the State's definition of adequate progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2)(A)(i) of this title, and, any school in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) virtually all students have met the State's advanced level of student performance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) equity in participation and achievement of students by sex has been achieved or significantly improved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Schools designated under this paragraph may serve as models and provide support to other schools, especially schoolwide programs and schools in school improvement, to assist such schools in meeting the State's student performance standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) States shall use funds reserved under section 6303(a) of this title and funds made available under section 6302(f) of this title to allow schools identified under this paragraph to carry out the activities described in subparagraph (B) and may use such funds to provide awards to such schools to further such school's education programs under this part, provide additional incentives for continued success, and reward individuals or groups in the school for exemplary performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A local educational agency may also recognize the success of a distinguished school by providing additional institutional and individual rewards, such as greater decisionmaking authority at the school building level, increased access to resources or supplemental services such as summer programs that may be used to sustain or increase success, additional professional development opportunities, opportunities to participate in special projects, and individual financial bonuses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Distinguished educators</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) When possible, distinguished educators shall be chosen from schools served under this part that have been especially successful in enabling children to meet or make outstanding progress toward meeting the State's student performance standards, such as the schools described in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Distinguished educators shall provide, as part of the statewide system, intensive and sustained assistance to the schools and local educational agencies farthest from meeting the State's student performance standards and to schoolwide programs as such programs develop and implement their plans, including participation in the support teams described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to implement this section funds reserved under section 6303(a) of this title and funds made available under section 6302(f) of this title may be used by a State for release time for teachers and administrators, travel, training, and other related costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Alternatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State may devise additional approaches to providing the assistance described in paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section, such as providing assistance through institutions of higher education and educational service agencies or other local consortia, and the State may seek approval from the Secretary to use funds reserved under section 6303 of this title and funds made available under section 6302(f) of this title for such approaches as part of the State plan.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6333. Basic grants to local educational agencies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount of grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grants for local educational agencies and Puerto Rico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The grant which a local educational agency in a State is eligible to receive under this subpart for a fiscal year shall (except as provided in section 6337 of this title), be determined by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section by 40 percent of the amount determined under the next sentence. The amount determined under this sentence shall be the average per pupil expenditure in the State except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the average per pupil expenditure in the State is less than 80 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States, such amount shall be 80 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the average per pupil expenditure in the State is more than 120 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States, such amount shall be 120 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basis for calculating grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal years 1995 through 1998, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority during any particular fiscal year to make the allocations under this part (other than section 6334 of this title) directly to local educational agencies without regard to the counties. If the Secretary approves an application of a State educational agency for a particular year under this subparagraph, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such allocations will be made using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such allocations will be made using alternative data approved by the Secretary that the State determines best reflects the distribution of children in poor families and is adjusted to be equivalent in proportion to the number of children determined in accordance with subsection (c) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such allocations will be made using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In addition, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that a procedure will be established through which local educational agencies dissatisfied with the determinations made by the State educational agency may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination. Beginning in fiscal year 1999, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of population data compiled for local educational agencies, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable taking into consideration the recommendations of the study to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data referred to in this paragraph are inappropriate or unreliable, the Secretaries shall jointly issue a report setting forth their reasons in detail. In years when grants are calculated by the Secretary on the basis of local educational agency data, for each local educational agency serving an area with a total population of at least 20,000 persons, the grant under this section shall be the amount determined by the Secretary. For local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons, the State educational agency may either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) distribute to such local educational agencies grants under this section equal to the amounts determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) use an alternative method, approved by the Secretary, to distribute the share of the State's total grants under this section that is based on local educational agencies with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. Such an alternative method of distributing grants under this section among a State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons shall be based upon population data that the State educational agency determines best reflect the current distribution of children in poor families among the State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. If a local educational agency serving an area with total population of less than 20,000 persons is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State education agency, then such local educational agency may appeal this determination to the Secretary. The Secretary must respond to this appeal within 45 days of receipt.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Puerto Rico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the percentage which the average per pupil expenditure in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is of the lowest average per pupil expenditure of any of the 50 States. The grant which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be eligible to receive under this section for a fiscal year shall be the amount arrived at by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for the <!-- PDFPage:1061 -->Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage determined under the preceding sentence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 32 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) &ldquo;State&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum number of children to qualify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the succeeding sentence, a local educational agency shall be eligible for a basic grant for a fiscal year under this subpart only if the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section in the school district of such local educational agency is at least 10. Beginning in fiscal year 1996, no local educational agency shall be eligible for a grant under this section if the number of children counted for grants under this section is equal to 2 percent or less of the total school age population in the local educational agency. For fiscal years 1996 through 1998, grants not made as a result of applying the preceding sentence shall be reallocated by the State educational agency to other eligible local educational agencies in the State in proportion to the distribution of other funds under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Children to be counted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Categories of children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The number of children to be counted for purposes of this section is the aggregate of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of the local educational agency from families below the poverty level as determined under paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency from families above the poverty level as determined under paragraph (5); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency in institutions for neglected and delinquent children (other than such institutions operated by the United States), but not counted pursuant to subpart 1 of part D of this subchapter for the purposes of a grant to a State agency, or being supported in foster homes with public funds.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of number of children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data, described in paragraph (3), available from the Department of Commerce. For fiscal year 1999 and beyond, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be treated as individual local educational agencies. If a local educational agency contains two or more counties in their entirety, then each county will be treated as if such county were a separate local educational agency for purposes of calculating grants under this part. The total of grants for such counties shall be allocated to such a local educational agency, which local educational agency shall distribute to schools in each county within such agency a share of the local educational agency's total grant that is no less than the county's share of the population counts used to calculate the local educational agency's grant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Population updates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In fiscal year 1997 and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary shall use updated data on the number of children, aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level for counties or local educational agencies, published by the Department of Commerce, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable, taking into consideration the recommendations of the study to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data referred to in this paragraph are inappropriate or unreliable, they shall jointly issue a report setting forth their reasons in detail. In determining the families which are below the poverty level, the Secretary shall utilize the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census, in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Education shall, within 30 days after October 20, 1994, contract with the National Academy of Sciences (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Academy&rdquo;) to study the program to produce intercensal poverty data for small geographic areas and certain age cohorts being developed by the Bureau of the Census.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In conducting its study, the Academy shall consider such matters as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the methodology used to produce and publish intercensal poverty data, and possible alternative methods to improve the usefulness of the data for Federal program purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the availability of alternative indicators of poverty for small geographic areas, against which the poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census could be compared;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the reliability of the poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census, particularly for less populous geographic areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the reliability of intercensal poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census, as compared over time to similar data produced by the Bureau of the Census during the most recent decennial census; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) the usefulness of poverty data produced and published by the Bureau of the Census for Federal programs that allocate funds to State and sub-State areas based, in whole or in part, on such data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall collect and transmit the information required by this subparagraph to the Secretary not later than January 1 of each year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Estimate</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligibility for and amount of grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, each local educational agency, in a State other than Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau, which is eligible for a grant under this part for any fiscal year shall be eligible for an additional grant under this section for that fiscal year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title in the county (for fiscal years 1996 through 1998), or local educational agency (for fiscal years beginning with 1999) for the fiscal year exceeds 6,500; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title exceeds 15 percent of the total number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the county (for fiscal years 1996 through 1998), or local educational agency (for fiscal years beginning with 1999) in that fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding such subsections (b)(1) and (d) of section 6332 of this title, no State described in subparagraph (A) shall receive less than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 0.25 percent of total grants; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the average of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) one-quarter of 1 percent of the sums available to carry out this section for such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) $340,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) the number of children in such State counted for purposes of this section in that fiscal year multiplied by 150 percent of the national average per pupil payment made with funds available under this section for that year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each county or local educational agency eligible to receive an additional grant under this section for any fiscal year the Secretary shall determine the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title for that fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the quotient resulting from the division of the amount determined for those agencies under section 6333(a)(1) of this title for the fiscal year for which the determination is being made divided by the total number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title for that agency for fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the additional grant for which an eligible local educational agency or county is eligible under this section for any fiscal year shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount available to carry out this section for that fiscal year as the product determined under paragraph (2) for such local educational agency for that fiscal year bears to the sum of such products for all local educational agencies in the United States for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Suballocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal years 1996 through 1998, county amounts shall be suballocated to local educational agencies meeting the criteria of paragraph (1)(A) by State educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. For fiscal years 1995 through 1998, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of the number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority during any particular fiscal year to make the allocations under this part (other than this section) directly to local educational agencies without regard to the counties. If the Secretary approves an application of a State educational agency for a particular year under this paragraph, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such allocations will be made using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such allocations will be made using alternative data approved by the Secretary that the State determines best reflects the distribution of children in poor families and is adjusted to be equivalent in proportion to the number of children determined in accordance with section 6333(c) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such allocations will be made using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In addition, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that a procedure will <!-- PDFPage:1064 -->be established through which local educational agencies dissatisfied with the determinations made by the State educational agency may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination. A State may reserve not more than 2 percent of its allocations in fiscal years 1996 through 1998 under this section for the purpose of making grants to local educational agencies that meet the criteria of clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A), but are in ineligible counties. For fiscal years beginning with 1999, for each local educational agency serving an area with a total population of at least 20,000 persons, the grant under this section shall be the amount determined by the Secretary. For local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons, the State educational agency may either (i) distribute to such local educational agencies grants under this section equal to the amounts determined by the Secretary; or (ii) use an alternative method, approved by the Secretary, to distribute the share of the State's total grants under this section that is based on local educational agencies with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. Such an alternative method of distributing grants under this section among a State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons shall be based upon population data that the State educational agency determines best reflects the current distribution of children in poor families among the State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons and meeting the eligibility criteria of paragraph (1)(A). If a local educational agency serving an area with total population of less than 20,000 persons is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State educational agency, then such local educational agency may appeal this determination to the Secretary. The Secretary shall respond to this appeal within 45 days of receipt. The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Commerce regarding whether available data on population for local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons are sufficiently reliable to be used to determine final grants to such areas meeting the eligibility criteria of paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reservation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the total amount of funds available for this section and sections 6333 and 6335 of this title, an amount equal to the appropriation for fiscal year 1995 for section 1006 of this Act (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) shall be available to carry out this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Ratable reduction rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the sums available under subsection (b) of this section for any fiscal year for making payments under this section are not sufficient to pay in full the total amounts which all States are eligible to receive under subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year, the maximum amounts which all States are eligible to receive under subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year shall be ratably reduced. In the case that additional funds become available for making such payments for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence is applicable, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) States receiving minimum grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In States that receive the minimum grant under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the State educational agency shall allocate such funds among the local educational agencies in each State either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (4) of subsection (a) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) based on their respective concentrations and numbers of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title, except that only those local educational agencies with concentrations or numbers of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title that exceed the statewide average percentage of such children or the statewide average number of such children shall receive any funds on the basis of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the weighting factor for Puerto Rico under this paragraph shall not be greater than the total <!-- PDFPage:1066 -->number of children counted under section 6333(c) of this title multiplied by 1.72.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Local educational agency allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For fiscal years 1995 through 1998, grants shall be calculated by the Secretary on the basis of the number of children counted under section 6333 of this title for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations published by the Secretary. In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority during any particular fiscal year to make the allocations under this part (other than section 6334 of this title) directly to local educational agencies without regard to the counties. If the Secretary approves an application of a State educational agency for a particular year under this subparagraph, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such allocations will be made using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such allocations will be made using alternative data approved by the Secretary that the State determines best reflects the distribution of children in poor families and is adjusted to be equivalent in proportion to the number of children determined in accordance with section 6333(c) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such allocations will be made using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition, the State educational agency shall provide assurances that a procedure will be established through which local educational agencies dissatisfied with the determinations made by the State educational agency may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination. For fiscal years beginning in 1999, for each local educational agency serving an area with a total population of at least 20,000 persons, the grant under this section shall be the amount determined by the Secretary. For local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons, the State educational agency may either (1) distribute to such local educational agencies grants under this section equal to the amounts determined by the Secretary; or (2) use an alternative method, approved by the Secretary, to distribute the share of the State's total grants under this section that is based on local educational agencies with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. Such an alternative method of distributing grants under this section among a State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons shall be based upon population data that the State educational agency determines best reflects the current distribution of children in poor families among the State's local educational agencies serving areas with total populations of fewer than 20,000 persons. If a local educational agency serving an area with total populations of less than 20,000 persons is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State educational agency, then the local educational agency may appeal this determination to the Secretary. The Secretary shall respond to this appeal within 45 days of receipt.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or subsection (b)(1) or (d) of section 6332 of this title, from the total amount available for any fiscal year to carry out this section, each State shall be allotted at least the lesser of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effort factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the effort factor for a State shall be determined in accordance with the succeeding sentence, except that such factor shall not be less than .95 nor greater than 1.05. The effort factor determined under this sentence shall be a fraction the numerator of which is the product of the three-year average per-pupil expenditure in the State multiplied by the three-year average per capita income in the United States and the denominator of which is the product of the three-year average per capita income in such State multiplied by the three-year average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1067 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The effort factor for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be equal to the lowest effort factor calculated under subparagraph (A) for any State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Equity factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall determine the equity factor under this section for each State in accordance with clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii)(I) For each State, the Secretary shall compute a weighted coefficient of variation for the per-pupil expenditures of local educational agencies in accordance with subclauses (II), (III), (IV), and (V).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) In computing coefficients of variation, the Secretary shall weigh the variation between per-pupil expenditures in each local educational agency and the average per-pupil expenditures in the State according to the number of pupils in the local educational agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) In determining the number of pupils under this paragraph in each local educational agency and each State, the Secretary shall multiply the number of children from low-income families by 1.4 under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) In computing coefficients of variation, the Secretary shall include only those local educational agencies with an enrollment of more than 200 students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) The Secretary shall compute separate coefficients of variation for elementary, secondary, and unified local educational agencies and shall combine such coefficients into a single weighted average coefficient for the State by multiplying each coefficient by the total enrollments of the local educational agencies in each group, adding such products, and dividing such sum by the total enrollments of the local educational agencies in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The equity factor for a State that meets the disparity standard described in section 222.63 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) or a State with only one local educational agency shall be not greater than .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary may revise each State's equity factor as necessary based on the advice of independent education finance scholars to reflect other need-based costs of local educational agencies in addition to low-income student enrollment, such as differing geographic costs, costs associated with students with disabilities, children with limited-English proficiency or other meaningful educational needs, which deserve additional support. In addition and also with the advice of independent education finance scholars, the Secretary may revise each State's equity factor to incorporate other valid and accepted methods to achieve adequacy of educational opportunity that may not be reflected in a coefficient of variation method.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All funds awarded to each State under this section shall be allocated to local educational agencies and schools on a basis consistent with the distribution of other funds to such agencies and schools under sections 6333, 6334, and 6335 of this title to carry out activities under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Maintenance of effort</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a State is entitled to receive its full allotment of funds under this part for any fiscal year if the Secretary finds that either the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures within the State with respect to the provision of free public education for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made was not less than 90 percent of such combined fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduction of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reduce the amount of the of&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6336_1_target" name="6336_1">1</a></sup> funds awarded to any State under this section in any fiscal year in the exact proportion to which the State fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) by falling below 90 percent of both the fiscal effort per student and aggregate expenditures (using the measure most favorable to the State), and no such lesser amount shall be used for computing the effort required under paragraph (1) for subsequent years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Waivers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may waive, for one fiscal year only, the requirements of this subsection if the Secretary determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of making grants under this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the three succeeding fiscal years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Each State (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) is entitled to receive under this part, for each fiscal year, an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sum of the estimated number of migratory children aged three through 21 who reside in the State full time and the full-time equivalent of the estimated number of migratory children aged three through 21 who reside in the State part time, as determined in accordance with subsection (e) of this section; multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in the State, except that the amount determined under this paragraph shall not be less than 32 percent, nor more than 48 percent, of the average expenditure per pupil in the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Ratable reductions; reallocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If, after the Secretary reserves funds under section 6398(c) of this title, the amount appropriated to carry out this part for any fiscal year is insufficient to pay in full the amounts for which all States are eligible, the Secretary shall ratably reduce each such amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If additional funds become available for making such payments for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate such funds to States in amounts that the Secretary determines will best carry out the purpose of this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall further reduce the amount of any grant to a State under this part for any fiscal year if the Secretary determines, based on available information on the numbers and needs of migratory children in the State and the program proposed by the State to address such needs, that such amount exceeds the amount required under section 6394 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall reallocate such excess funds to other States whose grants under this part would otherwise be insufficient to provide an appropriate level of services to migratory children, in such amounts as the Secretary determines are appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consortium arrangements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a State that receives a grant of $1,000,000 or less under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the State educational agency to determine whether consortium arrangements with another State or other appropriate entity would result in delivery of services in a more effective and efficient manner.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Determining numbers of eligible children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to determine the estimated number of migratory children residing in each State for purposes of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use such information as the Secretary finds most accurately reflects the actual number of migratory children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop and implement a procedure for more accurately reflecting cost factors for different types of summer and intersession program designs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) adjust the full-time equivalent number of migratory children who reside in each State to take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the special needs of those children participating in special programs provided <!-- PDFPage:1076 -->under this part that operate during the summer and intersession periods; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the additional costs of operating such programs; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A large percentage of youth in the juvenile justice system have poor academic achievement, are a year or more behind grade level, and have dropped out of school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There is a strong correlation between academic failure and involvement in delinquent activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Preventing students from dropping out of local schools and addressing the educational needs of delinquent youth can help reduce the dropout rate and involvement in delinquent activities at the same time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Many schools and correctional facilities fail to communicate regarding a youth's academic needs and students often return to their home school ill-prepared to meet current curriculum requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Schools are often reluctant to deal with youth returning from facilities and receive no funds to deal with the unique educational and other needs of such youth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A continuing need exists for activities and programs to reduce the incidence of youth dropping out of school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal dropout prevention programs have demonstrated effectiveness in keeping children and youth in school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Pregnant and parenting teens are a high at-risk group for dropping out of school and should be targeted by dropout prevention programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Such youth need a strong dropout prevention program which provides such youth with high level skills and which provides supports to youth returning from correctional facilities in order to keep such youth in school.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to improve educational services to children in local and State institutions for neglected or delinquent children and youth so that such children and youth have the opportunity to meet the same challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards that all children in the State will be expected to meet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide such children and youth the services needed to make a successful transition from institutionalization to further schooling or employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to prevent at-risk youth from dropping out of school and to provide dropouts and youth returning from institutions with a support system to ensure their continued education.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to carry out the purpose of this part the Secretary shall make grants to State educational agencies to enable such agencies to award subgrants to State agencies and local educational agencies to establish or improve programs of education for neglected or delinquent children and youth at risk of dropping out of school before graduation.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Reaching the National Education Goals, particularly the third, fourth, and fifth National Education Goals, requires a comprehensive educational reform strategy that involves parents, schools, government, communities, and other public and private organizations at all levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A crucial component of the strategy for achieving such goals is ensuring, through sustained and intensive high-quality professional development, that all teachers will provide challenging learning experiences in the core academic subjects for their students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Decisionmaking as to what activities a State or local educational agency should undertake to improve teaching and learning are best made by individuals in the schools closest to the classroom and most knowledgeable about the needs of schools and students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The potential positive impact of high-quality professional development is underscored by recent research findings that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) professional development must be focused on teaching and learning in order to improve the opportunities of all students to achieve higher standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) effective professional development focuses on discipline-based knowledge and effective subject-specific pedagogical skills, involves teams of teachers, and, where appropriate, administrators and pupil services personnel, in a school and, through professional networks of teachers, and, where appropriate, teacher educators, administrators, pupil services personnel, and parents, is interactive and collaborative, motivates by its intrinsic content and relationship to practice, builds on experience and learning-by-doing, and becomes incorporated into the everyday life of the school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) professional development can dramatically improve classroom instruction and learning when teachers, and, where appropriate, administrators, pupil services personnel, and parents, are partners in the development and implementation of such professional development; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) new and innovative strategies for teaching to high standards will require time for teachers, outside of the time spent teaching, for instruction, practice, and collegial collaboration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Special attention must be given in professional development activities to ensure that education professionals are knowledgeable of, and make use of, strategies for serving populations that historically have lacked access to equal opportunities for advanced learning and career advancement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Professional development is often a victim of budget reductions in fiscally difficult times.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1091 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The Federal Government has a vital role in helping States and local educational agencies to make sustained and intensive high-quality professional development in the core academic subjects become an integral part of the elementary and secondary education system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Professional development activities must prepare teachers, pupil services personnel, paraprofessionals and other staff in the collaborative skills needed to appropriately teach children with disabilities, in the core academic subjects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Parental involvement is an important aspect of school reform and improvement. There is a need for special attention to ensure the effective involvement of parents in the education of their children. Professional development should include methods and strategies to better prepare teachers and, where appropriate, administrators, to enable parents to participate fully and effectively in their children's education.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) underlying the standards-driven framework of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.] and the high academic standards for eligible students under subchapter I of this chapter is a widespread need to prepare teachers to teach to higher standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prospective and current teachers need knowledge and skills beyond what such teachers currently possess;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) while both the Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.] and subchapters I and II of this chapter have extensive references to professional development of teachers, there are no provisions to incorporate &ldquo;on-the-ground&rdquo; planning and implementation to serve as models for local educational agencies across the Nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) better prepared teachers can lead to improved student achievement, especially for students who are furthest from reaching high standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to address the need for professional development with a primary focus on teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide both prospective teachers and current teachers opportunities to learn both the content and the pedagogy needed to teach to high standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to build models, in a few cities and States, that demonstrate new organizational arrangements and deep investments in teachers necessary to better prepare teachers for new standards and assessments.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) technology can produce far greater opportunities for all students to learn to high standards, promote efficiency and effectiveness in education, and help propel our Nation's school systems into very immediate and dramatic reform, without which our Nation will not meet the National Education Goals by the target year 2000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the use of technology as a tool in the teaching and learning process is essential to the development and maintenance of a technologically literate citizenry and an internationally competitive workforce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the acquisition and use of technology in education throughout the United States has been inhibited by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the absence of Federal leadership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the inability of many State and local educational agencies to invest in and support needed technologies;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1115 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the limited exposure of students and teachers to the power of technology as a cost-effective tool to improve student learning and achievement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the lack of appropriate electrical and telephone connections in the classroom; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the limited availability of appropriate technology-enhanced curriculum, instruction, professional development, and administrative support resources and services in the educational marketplace;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) policies at the Federal, State, and local levels concerning technology in education must address disparities in the availability of technology to different groups of students, give priority to serving students in greatest need, and recognize that educational telecommunications and technology can address educational equalization concerns and school restructuring needs by providing universal access to high-quality teaching and programs, particularly in urban and rural areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the increasing use of new technologies and telecommunications systems in business has increased the gap between schooling and work force preparation, and underscores the need for technology policies at the Federal, State, tribal, and local levels that address preparation for school-to-work transitions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) technology can enhance the ongoing professional development of teachers and administrators by providing constant access to updated research in teaching and learning by means of telecommunications, and, through exposure to technology advancements, keep teachers and administrators excited and knowledgeable about unfolding opportunities for the classroom;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) planned and creative uses of technology, combined with teachers adequately trained in the use of technology, can reshape our Nation's traditional method of providing education and empower teachers to create an environment in which students are challenged through rigorous, rich classroom instruction provided at a pace suited to each student's learning style, and in which students have increased opportunities to develop higher order thinking and technical skills;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) schools need new ways of financing the acquisition and maintenance of educational technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the needs for educational technology differ from State to State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) technology can provide students, parents, teachers, other education professionals, communities, and industry with increased opportunities for partnerships and with increased access to information, instruction, and educational services in schools and other settings, including homes, libraries, preschool and child-care facilities, adult and family education programs, and postsecondary institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the Department, consistent with the overall national technology policy established by the President, must assume a vital leadership and coordinating role in developing the national vision and strategy to infuse advanced technology throughout all educational programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Federal support can ease the burden at the State and local levels by enabling the acquisition of advanced technology and initiating the development of teacher training and support as well as new educational products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) leadership at the Federal level should consider guidelines to ensure that educational technology is accessible to all users with maximum interoperability nationwide;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the rapidly changing nature of technology requires coordination and flexibility in Federal leadership; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) technology has the potential to assist and support the improvement of teaching and learning in schools and other settings.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7102. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The seventh National Education Goal provides that by the year 2000, all schools in America will be free of drugs and violence and the unauthorized presence of firearms and alcohol, and offer a disciplined environment that is conducive to learning.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The widespread illegal use of alcohol and other drugs among the Nation's secondary school students, and increasingly by students in elementary schools as well, constitutes a grave threat to such students&rsquo; physical and mental well-being, and significantly impedes the learning process. For example, data show that students who drink tend to receive lower grades and are more likely to miss school because of illness than students who do not drink.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Our Nation's schools and communities are increasingly plagued by violence and crime. Approximately 3,000,000 thefts and violent crimes occur in or near our Nation's schools every year, the equivalent of more than 16,000 incidents per school day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Violence that is linked to prejudice and intolerance victimizes entire communities leading to more violence and discrimination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The tragic consequences of violence and the illegal use of alcohol and drugs by students are felt not only by students and such students&rsquo; families, but by such students&rsquo; communities and the Nation, which can ill afford to lose such students&rsquo; skills, talents, and vitality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) While use of illegal drugs is a serious problem among a minority of teenagers, alcohol use is far more widespread. The proportion of high school students using alcohol, though lower than a decade ago, remains unacceptably high. By the 8th grade, 70 percent of youth report having tried alcohol and by the 12th grade, about 88 percent have used alcohol. Alcohol use by young people can and does have adverse consequences for users, their families, communities, schools, and colleges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Alcohol and tobacco are widely used by young people. Such use can, and does, have adverse consequences for young people, their families, communities, schools, and colleges. Drug prevention programs for youth that address only controlled drugs send an erroneous message that alcohol and tobacco do not present significant problems, or that society is willing to overlook their use. To be credible, messages opposing illegal drug use by youth should address alcohol and tobacco as well.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Every day approximately 3,000 children start smoking. Thirty percent of all secondary school seniors are smokers. Half of all new smokers begin smoking before the age of 14, 90 percent of such smokers begin before the age of 21, and the average age of the first use of smokeless tobacco is under the age of 10. Use of tobacco products has been linked to serious health problems. Drug education and prevention programs that include tobacco have been effective in reducing teenage use of tobacco.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1136 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Drug and violence prevention programs are essential components of a comprehensive strategy to promote school safety and to reduce the demand for and use of drugs throughout the Nation. Schools and local organizations in communities throughout the Nation have a special responsibility to work together to combat the growing epidemic of violence and illegal drug use and should measure the success of their programs against clearly defined goals and objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Students must take greater responsibility for their own well-being, health, and safety if schools and communities are to achieve the goals of providing a safe, disciplined, and drug-free learning environment.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) magnet schools are a significant part of our Nation's effort to achieve voluntary desegregation in our Nation's schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the use of magnet schools has increased dramatically since the date of enactment of the Magnet Schools Assistance program, with approximately 1,400,000 students nationwide now attending such schools, of which more than 60 percent of the students are nonwhite;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) magnet schools offer a wide range of distinctive programs that have served as models for school improvement efforts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in administering the Magnet Schools Assistance program, the Federal Government has learned that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) where magnet programs are implemented for only a portion of a school's student body, special efforts must be made to discourage the isolation of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) magnet school students from other students in the school; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) students by racial characteristics;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) local educational agencies can maximize their effectiveness in achieving the purposes of the Magnet Schools Assistance program if such agencies have more flexibility in the administration of such program in <!-- PDFPage:1148 -->order to serve students attending a school who are not enrolled in the magnet school program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) local educational agencies must be creative in designing magnet schools for students at all academic levels, so that school districts do not skim off only the highest achieving students to attend the magnet schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consistent with desegregation guidelines, local educational agencies must seek to enable participation in magnet school programs by students who reside in the neighborhoods where the programs operate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in order to ensure that magnet schools are sustained after Federal funding ends, the Federal Government must assist school districts to improve their capacity to continue to operate magnet schools at a high level of performance; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) continue the Federal Government's support of school districts implementing court-ordered desegregation plans and school districts seeking to foster meaningful interaction among students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, beginning at the earliest stage of such students&rsquo; education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ensure that all students have equitable access to quality education that will prepare such students to function well in a culturally diverse, technologically oriented, and highly competitive, global community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) maximize the ability of local educational agencies to plan, develop, implement and continue effective and innovative magnet schools that contribute to State and local systemic reform.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) since the enactment of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], women and girls have made strides in educational achievement and in their ability to avail themselves of educational opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of funding provided under the Women's Educational Equity Act, more curricula, training, and other educational materials concerning educational equity for women and girls are available for national dissemination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) teaching and learning practices in the United States are frequently inequitable as such practices relate to women and girls, for example&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sexual harassment, particularly that experienced by girls, undermines the ability of schools to provide a safe and equitable learning or workplace environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) classroom textbooks and other educational materials do not sufficiently reflect the experiences, achievements, or concerns of women and, in most cases, are not written by women or persons of color;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) girls do not take as many mathematics and science courses as boys, girls lose confidence in their mathematics and science ability as girls move through adolescence, and there are few women role models in the sciences; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) pregnant and parenting teenagers are at high risk for dropping out of school and existing dropout prevention programs do not adequately address the needs of such teenagers;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) efforts to improve the quality of public education also must include efforts to ensure equal access to quality education programs for all women and girls;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Federal support should address not only research and development of innovative model curricula and teaching and learning strategies to promote gender equity, but should also assist schools and local communities implement gender equitable practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Federal assistance for gender equity must be tied to systemic reform, involve collaborative efforts to implement effective gender practices at the local level, and encourage parental participation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) excellence in education, high educational achievements and standards, and the full participation of women and girls in American society, cannot be achieved without educational equity for women and girls.</p>

The Secretary may use the peer review process to determine grant recipients of funds transferred in accordance with this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that chapter 2 of title I of this Act (as such chapter was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) has been successful in achieving the goals of increasing local flexibility, reducing administrative burden, providing services for private school students, encouraging innovation, and contributing to the improvement of elementary and secondary educational programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of programs under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1159 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to support local education reform efforts which are consistent with and support statewide reform efforts under Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to support State and local efforts to accomplish the National Education Goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide funding to enable State and local educational agencies to implement promising educational reform programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide a continuing source of innovation, and educational improvement, including support for library services and instructional and media materials; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to meet the special educational needs of at risk and high cost students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State and local responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basic responsibility for the administration of funds made available under this subchapter is within the State educational agencies, but it is the intent of Congress that the responsibility be carried out with a minimum of paperwork and that the responsibility for the design and implementation of programs assisted under this subchapter will be mainly that of local educational agencies, school superintendents and principals, and classroom teachers and supporting personnel, because such agencies and individuals have the most direct contact with students and are most likely to be able to design programs to meet the educational needs of students in their own school districts.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7402. Findings, policy, and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) language-minority Americans speak virtually all world languages plus many that are indigenous to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there are large and growing numbers of children and youth of limited-English proficiency, many of whom have a cultural heritage that differs from that of their English-proficient peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the presence of language-minority Americans is related in part to Federal immigration policies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) many language-minority Americans are limited in their English proficiency, and many have limited education and income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) limited English proficient children and youth face a number of challenges in receiving an education that will enable such children and youth to participate fully in American society, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) segregated education programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) disproportionate and improper placement in special education and other special programs due to the use of inappropriate evaluation procedures;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1165 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the limited-English proficiency of their own parents, which hinders the parents&rsquo; ability to fully participate in the education of their children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a shortage of teachers and other staff who are professionally trained and qualified to serve such children and youth;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Native Americans and Native American languages (as such terms are defined in section 2902 of title 25), including native residents of the outlying areas, have a unique status under Federal law that requires special policies within the broad purposes of this chapter to serve the education needs of language minority students in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) institutions of higher education can assist in preparing teachers, administrators and other school personnel to understand and build upon the educational strengths and needs of language-minority and culturally diverse student enrollments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) it is the purpose of this subchapter to help ensure that limited English proficient students master English and develop high levels of academic attainment in content areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) quality bilingual education programs enable children and youth to learn English and meet high academic standards including proficiency in more than one language;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) as the world becomes increasingly interdependent and as international communication becomes a daily occurrence in government, business, commerce, and family life, multilingual skills constitute an important national resource which deserves protection and development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) educational technology has the potential for improving the education of language-minority and limited English proficient students and their families, and the Federal Government should foster this development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) parent and community participation in bilingual education programs contributes to program effectiveness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) research, evaluation, and data-collection capabilities in the field of bilingual education need to be strengthened so that educators and other staff can better identify and promote those programs, program implementation strategies, and instructional practices that result in effective education of limited English proficient children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the use of a child or youth's native language and culture in classroom instruction can&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) promote self-esteem and contribute to academic achievement and learning English by limited English proficient children and youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) benefit English-proficient children and youth who also participate in such programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) develop our Nation's national language resources, thus promoting our Nation's competitiveness in the global economy;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) the Federal Government, as exemplified by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.] and section 1703(f) of this title, has a special and continuing obligation to ensure that States and local school districts take appropriate action to provide equal educational opportunities to children and youth of limited English proficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) the Federal Government also, as exemplified by the Federal Government's efforts under this subchapter, has a special and continuing obligation to assist States and local school districts in developing the capacity to provide programs of instruction that offer limited English proficient children and youth an equal educational opportunity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares it to be the policy of the United States, in order to ensure equal educational opportunity for all children and youth and to promote educational excellence, to assist State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education and community-based organizations to build their capacity to establish, implement, and sustain programs of instruction for children and youth of limited English proficiency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this part is to educate limited English proficient children and youth to meet the same rigorous standards for academic performance expected of all children and youth, including meeting challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards in academic areas by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) developing systemic improvement and reform of educational programs serving limited English proficient students through the development and implementation of exemplary bilingual education programs and special alternative instruction programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) developing bilingual skills and multicultural understanding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) developing the English of such children and youth and, to the extent possible, the native language skills of such children and youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) providing similar assistance to Native Americans with certain modifications relative to the unique status of Native American languages under Federal law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) developing data collection and dissemination, research, materials development, and technical assistance which is focused on school improvement for limited English proficient students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) developing programs which strengthen and improve the professional training of educational personnel who work with limited English proficient students.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Foreign language proficiency is crucial to our Nation's economic competitiveness and national security. Significant improvement in the quantity and quality of foreign language instruction offered in our Nation's elementary and secondary schools is necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All Americans need a global perspective. To understand the world around us, we must acquaint ourselves with the languages, cultures, and history of other nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Proficiency in two or more languages should be promoted for all American students. Multilingualism enhances cognitive and social growth, competitiveness in the global marketplace, national security, and understanding of diverse people and cultures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States lags behind other developed countries in offering foreign language study to elementary and secondary school students.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1179 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Four out of five new jobs in the United States are created from foreign trade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The optimum time to begin learning a second language is in elementary school, when children have the ability to learn and excel in several foreign language acquisition skills, including pronunciation, and when children are most open to appreciating and valuing a culture other than their own.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Foreign language study can increase childrens&rsquo; capacity for critical and creative thinking skills and children who study a second language show greater cognitive development in areas such as mental flexibility, creativity, tolerance, and higher order thinking skills.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Children who have studied a foreign language in elementary school achieve expected gains and score higher on standardized tests of reading, language arts, and mathematics than children who have not studied a foreign language.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Computation of payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b), (d), or (f) of this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of children who were in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding school year and who, while in attendance at such schools&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) resided on Federal property with a parent employed on Federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the school district of such agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) resided on Federal property with a parent who is an official of, and accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) resided on Federal property and had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined in section 101 of title 37);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) resided on Indian lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined by section 101 of title 37) but did not reside on Federal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) had a parent who is an official of, and has been accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer but did not reside on Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) resided in low-rent housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) resided on Federal property and is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) resided with a parent employed on Federal property situated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in whole or in part in the county in which such agency is located, or in whole or in part in such agency if such agency is located in more than one county; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if not in such county, in whole or in part in the same State as such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of weighted student units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 6,500; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 1,000 or such number equals or exceeds 10 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Military installation housing undergoing renovation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of computing the amount of a payment for a local educational agency for children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i), the Secretary shall consider such children to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of Defense, that such children would have resided in housing on Federal property in accordance with paragraph (1)(B) except that such housing was undergoing renovation on the date for which the Secretary determines the number of children under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basic support payments; insufficient appropriations; State with only one local educational agency</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basic support payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at least 400 such children; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily <!-- PDFPage:1191 -->attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this subsection for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located, multiplied by the local contribution percentage.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For any fiscal year in which the sums appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title are insufficient to pay to each local educational agency the full amount computed under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make payments in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Learning opportunity threshold payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall compute a learning opportunity threshold payment (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;threshold payment&rdquo;) by multiplying the amount obtained under paragraph (1)(C) by the total percentage obtained by adding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the percentage of federally connected children for each local educational agency determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of children described under subsection (a)(1) of this section and the denominator of which is the total number of children in average daily attendance at the schools served by such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the percentage that funds under paragraph (1)(C) represent of the total budget of the local educational agency, determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of funds calculated for each local educational agency under this paragraph (not including amounts received under subsection (f) of this section), and the denominator of which is the total current expenditures for such agency in the second preceding fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Such total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 100.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For the purpose of determining the percentages described in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) that are applicable to the local educational agency providing free public education to students in grades 9 through 12 residing on Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, the Secretary shall consider only that portion of such agency's total enrollment of students in grades 9 through 12 when calculating the percentage under such subclause (I) and only that portion of the total current expenditures attributed to the operation of grades 9 through 12 in such agency when calculating the percentage under subclause (II).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Ratable distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall make payments as a ratable distribution based upon the computation made under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) States with only one local educational agency</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any of the 50 States of the United States in which there is only one local educational agency, the Secretary shall, for purposes of paragraphs (1)(B), (1)(C), and (2) of this subsection, and subsection (e) of this section, consider each administrative school district in the State to be a separate local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Computation of maximum amount of basic support payment and threshold payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In computing the maximum payment amount under paragraph (1)(C) and the learning opportunity threshold payment under paragraph (2)(B) for an administrative school district described in subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Secretary shall first determine the maximum payment amount and the total current expenditures for the State as a whole; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Secretary shall then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) proportionately allocate such maximum payment amount among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective weighted student units of such districts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) proportionately allocate such total current expenditures among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective number of students in average daily attendance at such districts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prior year data</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (f) of this section, all calculations under this section shall be based on data for each local educational agency from not later than the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the agency is making application for payment.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1192 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Calculations for a local educational agency that is newly established by a State shall, for the first year of operation of such agency, be based on data from the fiscal year for which the agency is making application for payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Children with disabilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(c) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay to each eligible local educational agency, on a pro rata basis, the amounts determined by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) multiplying the number of children described in subparagraphs (A)(ii), (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section who are eligible to receive services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) by a factor of 1.0; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) multiplying the number of children described in subparagraph (D) of subsection (a)(1) of this section who are eligible to receive services under such Act by a factor of 0.5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of fiscal year 1995 only, under subsections (a) and (b) of section 3 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, or 1999, under such subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For fiscal year 1995 only, the Secretary shall pay, to each local educational agency that is not eligible for a payment under subsection (b) of this section but that received a payment under section 3 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) for fiscal year 1994, an amount which is not less than 85 percent of the payment such agency received under such section 3 for fiscal year 1994.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Ratable reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) If necessary in order to make payments to local educational agencies in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary first shall ratably reduce payments under subsection (b) of this section to local educational agencies that do not receive a payment under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If additional funds become available for making payments under subsection (b) of this section for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under clause (i) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) If the sums made available under this subchapter for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that all local educational agencies in all States are eligible to receive under paragraphs (1) and (2) after the application of subparagraph (A) for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce payments to all such agencies for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If additional funds become available for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under clause (i) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">From amounts appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide additional assistance to meet special circumstances relating to the provision of education in local educational agencies eligible to receive assistance under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A local educational agency is eligible to receive additional assistance under this subsection if such agency is eligible for a supplementary payment in accordance with subparagraph (B) or such agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i)(I) has an enrollment of federally connected children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section which constitutes a percentage of the total student enrollment of such agency which is not less than 50 percent if such agency receives a payment on behalf of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of such subsection, or not less than 40 percent if such agency does not receive a payment on behalf of such children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) has a tax rate for general fund purposes which is at least 95 percent of the average tax rate for general fund purposes of comparable local educational agencies in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii)(I) has an enrollment of federally connected children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section which constitutes at least 25 <!-- PDFPage:1193 -->percent of the total student enrollment of such agency. For purposes of this subclause, all students described in subsection (a)(1) of this section are used to determine eligibility, regardless of whether or not a local educational agency receives funds for these children from subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) has a tax rate for general fund purposes which is at least 125 percent of the average tax rate for general fund purposes of comparable local educational agencies in the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is a local educational agency whose boundaries are the same as a Federal military installation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any local educational agency determined eligible under clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall be deemed to have met the tax effort requirements for eligibility under clause (i)(II) or (ii)(II) of such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A local educational agency shall only be eligible to receive additional assistance under this subsection if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such agency is exercising due diligence in availing itself of State and other financial assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the eligibility of such agency under State law for State aid with respect to the free public education of children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and the amount of such aid are determined on a basis no less favorable to such agency than the basis used in determining the eligibility of local educational agencies for State aid, and the amount of such aid, with respect to the free public education of other children in the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Maximum payments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) parents of such children and Indian tribes are afforded an opportunity to present their views on such programs and activities, including an opportunity to make recommendations on the needs of those children and how the local educational agency may help such children realize the benefits of such programs and activities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) relevant applications, evaluations, and program plans are disseminated to the parents and Indian tribes; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Technical assistance and enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide technical assistance to local educational agencies, parents, and Indian tribes to enable such agencies, parents, and tribes to carry out this section; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Complaints</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Any tribe, or its designee, which has students in attendance at a local educational agency may, in its discretion and without regard to the requirements of any other provision of law, file a written complaint with the Secretary regarding any action of a local educational agency taken pursuant to, or relevant to, the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Within ten working days from receipt of a complaint, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) designate a time and place for a hearing into the matters relating to the complaint at a location in close proximity to the local educational agency involved, or if the Secretary determines there is good cause, at some other location convenient to both the tribe, or its designee, and the local educational agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) designate a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) notify the affected tribe or tribes and the local educational agency involved of the time, place, and nature of the hearing and send copies of the complaint to the local educational agency and the affected tribe or tribes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the designation of a hearing examiner and <!-- PDFPage:1198 -->shall be open to the public. A record of the proceedings shall be established and maintained.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Evidence; recommendations; cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The complaining tribe, or its designee, and the local educational agency shall be entitled to present evidence on matters relevant to the complaint and to make recommendations concerning the appropriate remedial actions.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Findings and recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 30 days of the completion of the hearing, the hearing examiner shall, on the basis of the record, make written findings of fact and recommendations concerning appropriate remedial action, if any, which should be taken.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Copies provided</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon completion of the Secretary's final determination, the Secretary shall provide the complaining tribe, or its designee, and the local educational agency with copies of the hearing record, the hearing examiner's findings and recommendations, and the Secretary's final determination. The final determination of the Secretary shall be subject to judicial review.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary, or if the remedy required is not undertaken within the time established and the Secretary determines that an extension of the time established will not effectively encourage the remedy required, the Secretary shall withhold payment of all moneys to which such local agency is eligible under section 7703 of this title until such time as the remedy required is undertaken, except where the complaining tribe or its designee formally requests that such funds be released to the local educational agency, except that the Secretary may not withhold such moneys during the course of the school year if the Secretary determines that such withholding would substantially disrupt the educational programs of the local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Rejection of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary and a tribe exercises the option under section 1101(d) of the Education Amendments of 1978, to have education services provided either directly by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or by contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, any Indian students affiliated with that tribe who wish to remain in attendance at the local educational agency against whom the complaint which led to the tribal action under such subsection (d) of this section was lodged may be counted with respect to that local educational agency for the purpose of receiving funds under section 7703 of this title. In such event, funds under such section shall not be withheld pursuant to paragraph (8) and no further complaints with respect to such students may be filed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section is based upon the special relationship between the Indian nations and the United States and nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any State of any duty with respect to any citizens of that State.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a State may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider payments under this subchapter or under the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) in determining for any fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the eligibility of a local educational agency for State aid for free public education; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of such aid; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make such aid available to local educational agencies in a manner that results in less State aid to any local educational agency that is eligible for such payment than such agency would receive if such agency were not so eligible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State equalization plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may reduce State aid to a local educational agency that receives a payment under section 7702 or 7703(b) of this title (except the amount calculated in excess of 1.0 under subparagraph (B) of section 7703(a)(2) of this title) or under the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994 (other than an increase in payments described in paragraphs (2)(B), (2)(C), (2)(D), or (3)(B)(ii) of section 3(d) of such Act of September 30, 1950) for any fiscal year if the Secretary determines, and certifies under subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section, that such State has in effect a program of State aid that equalizes expenditures for free public education among local educational agencies in such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local educational agencies if, in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the amount of per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the highest such per-pupil expenditures or revenues did not exceed the amount of such per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the lowest such expenditures or revenues by more than 25 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) take into account the extent to which a program of State aid reflects the additional cost of providing free public education in particular types of local educational agencies, such as those that are geographically isolated, or to particular types of students, such as children with disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State has substantially revised its program of State aid, the Secretary may certify such program for any fiscal year only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary determines, on the basis of projected data, that the State's program will meet the disparity standard described in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State provides an assurance to the Secretary that, if final data do not demonstrate that the State's program met such standard for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the State will pay to each affected local educational agency the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures for review of State equalization plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Written notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any State that wishes to consider payments described in subsection (b)(1) of this section in providing State aid to local educational agencies shall submit to the Secretary, not later than 120 days before the beginning of the State's fiscal year, a written notice of such State's intention to do so.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such notice shall be in the form and contain the information the Secretary requires, including evidence that the State has notified each local educational agency in the State of such State's intention to consider such payments in providing State aid.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to present views</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before making a determination under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall afford the State, and local educational agencies in the State, an opportunity to present their views.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualification procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a program of State aid qualifies under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certify the program and so notify the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) afford an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with section 7711(a) of this title, <!-- PDFPage:1202 -->to any local educational agency adversely affected by such certification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Nonqualification procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a program of State aid does not qualify under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) so notify the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) afford an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with section 7711(a) of this title, to the State, and to any local educational agency adversely affected by such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of State aid</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State has in effect a program of State aid for free public education for any fiscal year, which is designed to equalize expenditures for free public education among the local educational agencies of that State, payments under this subchapter or under the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) for any fiscal year may be taken into consideration by such State in determining the relative&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) financial resources available to local educational agencies in that State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) financial need of such agencies for the provision of free public education for children served by such agency, except that a State may consider as local resources funds received under this subchapter or under the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) only in proportion to the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may not take into consideration payments under this subchapter or under the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) before such State's program of State aid has been certified by the Secretary under subsection (c)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Remedies for State violations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary or any aggrieved local educational agency may, not earlier than 150 days after an adverse determination by the Secretary against a State for violation of subsections (a) or (d)(2) of this section or for failure to carry out an assurance under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, and if an administrative proceeding has not been concluded within such time, bring an action in a United States district court against such State for such violations or failure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Immunity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State shall not be immune under the 11th amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The court shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal Government has a special responsibility to ensure that educational programs for all American Indian and Alaska Native children and adults&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are based on high-quality, internationally competitive content standards and student performance standards and build on Indian culture and the Indian community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) assist local educational agencies, Indian tribes, and other entities and individ<!-- PDFPage:1207 -->uals in providing Indian students the opportunity to achieve such standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) meet the special educational and culturally related academic needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) since the date of enactment of the initial Indian Education Act in 1972, the level of involvement of Indian parents in the planning, development, and implementation of educational programs that affect such parents and their children has increased significantly, and schools should continue to foster such involvement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) although the number of Indian teachers, administrators, and university professors has increased since 1972, teacher training programs are not recruiting, training, or retraining a sufficient number of Indian individuals as educators to meet the needs of a growing Indian student population in elementary, secondary, vocational, adult, and higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the dropout rate for Indian students is unacceptably high, for example, 9 percent of Indian students who were eighth graders in 1988 had already dropped out of school by 1990;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) during the period from 1980 to 1990, the percentage of Indian individuals living at or below the poverty level increased from 24 percent to 31 percent, and the readiness of Indian children to learn is hampered by the high incidence of poverty, unemployment, and health problems among Indian children and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) research related specifically to the education of Indian children and adults is very limited, and much of the research is of poor quality or is focused on limited local or regional issues.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13096. American Indian and Alaska Native Education</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13096, Aug. 6, 1998, 63 F.R. 42681, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in affirmation of the unique political and legal relationship of the Federal Government with tribal governments, and in recognition of the unique educational and culturally related academic needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Goals</em>. The Federal Government has a special, historic responsibility for the education of American Indian and Alaska Native students. Improving educational achievement and academic progress for American Indian and Alaska Native students is vital to the national goal of preparing every student for responsible citizenship, continued learning, and productive employment. The Federal Government is committed to improving the academic performance and reducing the dropout rate of American Indian and Alaska Native students. To help fulfill this commitment in a manner consistent with tribal traditions and cultures, Federal agencies need to focus special attention on six goals: (1) improving reading and mathematics; (2) increasing high school completion and postsecondary attendance rates; (3) reducing the influence of long-standing factors that impede educational performance, such as poverty and substance abuse; (4) creating strong, safe, and drug-free school environments; (5) improving science education; and (6) expanding the use of educational technology.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Strategy</em>. In order to meet the six goals of this order, a comprehensive Federal response is needed to address the fragmentation of government services available to American Indian and Alaska Native students and the complexity of intergovernmental relationships affecting the education of those students. The purpose of the Federal activities described in this order is to develop a long-term, comprehensive Federal Indian education policy that will accomplish those goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Interagency Task Force</em>. There is established an Interagency Task Force on American Indian and Alaska Native Education (Task Force) to oversee the planning and implementation of this order. The Task Force shall confer with the National Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE) in carrying out activities under this order. The Task Force shall consult with representatives of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and organizations, including the National Indian Education Association (NIEA) and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), to gather advice on implementation of the activities called for in this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Composition of the Task Force</em>. (1) The membership of the Task Force shall include representatives of the Departments of the Treasury, Defense, Justice, the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, and Education, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Corporation for National and Community Service, and the National Science Foundation. With the agreement of the Secretaries of Education and the Interior, other agencies may participate in the activities of the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each participating agency shall designate a senior official who is responsible for management or program administration to serve as a member of the Task Force. The official shall report directly to the agency head on the agency's activities under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education of the Department of Education and the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior shall co-chair the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Interagency plan</em>. The Task Force shall, within 90 days of the date of this order, develop a Federal interagency plan with recommendations identifying initiatives, strategies, and ideas for future interagency action supportive of the goals of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Agency participation</em>. To the extent consistent with law and agency priorities, each participating agency shall adopt and implement strategies to maximize the availability of the agency's education-related programs, activities, resources, information, and technical assistance to American Indian and Alaska Native students. In keeping with the spirit of the Executive Memorandum of April 29, 1994 [25 U.S.C. 450 note], on Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments and Executive Order 13084 of May 14, 1998 [25 U.S.C. 450 note], each participating agency shall consult with tribal governments on their education-related needs and priorities, and on how the agency can better accomplish the goals of this order. Within 6 months, each participating agency shall report to the Task Force regarding the strategies it has developed to ensure such consultation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) <em>Interagency resource guide</em>. The Task Force shall identify, within participating Federal agencies, all education-related programs and resources that support the goals of this order. Within 12 months, the Task Force, in conjunction with the Department of Education, shall develop, publish, and widely distribute a guide that describes those programs and resources and how American Indians and Alaska Natives can benefit from them.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1208 --><p class="note-body">(f) <em>Research</em>. The Secretary of Education, through the Office of Educational Research and Improvement and the Office of Indian Education, and in consultation with NACIE and participating agencies, shall develop and implement a comprehensive Federal research agenda to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) establish baseline data on academic achievement and retention of American Indian and Alaska Native students in order to monitor improvements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) evaluate promising practices used with those students; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) evaluate the role of native language and culture in the development of educational strategies. Within 1 year, the Secretary of Education shall submit the research agenda, including proposed timelines, to the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) <em>Comprehensive Federal Indian education policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The Task Force shall, within 2 years of the date of this order, develop a comprehensive Federal Indian education policy to support the accomplishment of the goals of this order. The policy shall be designed to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) improve Federal interagency cooperation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) promote intergovernmental collaboration; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) assist tribal governments in meeting the unique educational needs of their children, including the need to preserve, revitalize, and use native languages and cultural traditions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) In developing the policy, the Task Force shall consider ideas in the Comprehensive Federal Indian Education Policy Statement proposal developed by the NIEA and the NCAI.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The Task Force shall develop recommendations to implement the policy, including ideas for future interagency action.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) As appropriate, participating agencies may develop memoranda of agreement with one another to enable and enhance the ability of tribes and schools to provide, and to coordinate the delivery of, Federal, tribal, State, and local resources and services, including social and health-related services, to meet the educational needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) <em>Reports</em>. The Task Force co-chairs shall submit the comprehensive Federal Indian education policy, and report annually on the agencies&rsquo; activities, accomplishments, and progress toward meeting the goals of this order, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Regional partnership forums</em>. The Departments of Education and the Interior, in collaboration with the Task Force and Federal, tribal, State, and local government representatives, shall jointly convene, within 18 months, a series of regional forums to identify promising practices and approaches on how to share information, provide assistance to schools, develop partnerships, and coordinate intergovernmental strategies supportive of accomplishing the goals of this order. The Departments of Education and the Interior shall submit a report on the forums to the Task Force, which may include recommendations relating to intergovernmental relations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>School pilot sites</em>. The Departments of Education and the Interior shall identify a reasonable number of schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and public schools that can serve as a model for schools with American Indian and Alaska Native students, and provide them with comprehensive technical assistance in support of the goals of this order. A special team of technical assistance providers, including Federal staff, shall provide assistance to these schools. Special attention shall be given, where appropriate, to assistance in implementing comprehensive school reform demonstration programs that meet the criteria for those programs established by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public Law 105&ndash;78) [see Tables for classification], and to providing comprehensive service delivery that connects and uses diverse Federal agency resources. The team shall disseminate effective and promising practices of the school pilot sites to other local educational agencies. The team shall report to the Task Force on its accomplishments and its recommendations for improving technical support to local educational agencies and schools funded by the BIA.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Administration</em>. The Department of Education shall provide appropriate administrative services and staff support to the Task Force. With the consent of the Department of Education, other participating agencies may provide administrative support to the Task Force, consistent with their statutory authority, and may detail agency employees to the Department of Education, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Termination</em>. The Task Force established under section 2 of this order shall terminate not later than 5 years from the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>General provisions</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person. This order is not intended to preclude, supersede, replace, or otherwise dilute any other Executive order relating to American Indian and Alaska Native education.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7902. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was organized as a nation and internationally recognized as such by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and navigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) At the time of the arrival of the first non-indigenous people in Hawai&lsquo;i in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A unified monarchial government of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawai&lsquo;i.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i, which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i to govern friendship, commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally recognized, and indigenous government of Hawai&lsquo;i, the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, including United States citizens, who were assisted in their efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. Because of the participation of United States agents and citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i, the Congress, on behalf of the people of the United States, apologized to Native Hawaiians for the overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination through Public Law 103&ndash;150 (107 Stat. 1510).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled &ldquo;A Joint Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States&rdquo;, approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of Hawai&lsquo;i, including the government and crown lands of the former Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i, to the United States, but mandated that revenue generated from these lands be used &ldquo;solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, and in recognition of this severe decline, the Congress in 1921 enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, which designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, the Congress affirmed the special relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiians, as expressed by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, who was quoted in the committee report for the Hawaiian Homes Com<!-- PDFPage:1222 -->mission Act, 1920, as saying: &ldquo;One thing that impressed me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was the fact that the natives of the island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in poverty.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) In 1938, the United States Congress again acknowledged the unique status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781 et seq.), a provision to lease lands within the National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit fishing in the area &ldquo;only by native Hawaiian residents of said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their guidance.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Under the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawai&lsquo;i into the Union&rdquo; approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of Hawai&lsquo;i but reaffirmed the trust relationship which existed between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, including the power to approve land exchanges and legislative amendments affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawai&lsquo;i into the Union&rdquo;, approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States ceded to the State of Hawai&lsquo;i title to the public lands formerly held by the United States, but mandated that such lands be held by the State &ldquo;in public trust&rdquo; and reaffirmed the special relationship which existed between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the legal responsibility to enforce the public trust responsibility of the State of Hawai&lsquo;i for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The United States assumed special responsibilities for Native Hawaiian lands and resources at the time of the annexation of the Territory in 1898, upon adoption of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, and upon admission of the State of Hawai&lsquo;i into the Union in 1959, and has retained certain of those responsibilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) In recognition of the special relationship which exists between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people, the Congress has extended to Native Hawaiians the same rights and privileges accorded to American Indian, Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities under the Native American Programs Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 2991 et seq.], the American Indian Religious Freedom Act [42 U.S.C. 1996], the National Museum of the American Indian Act [20 U.S.C. 80q et seq.], the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act [25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.], the National Historic Preservation Act [16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.], and the Native American Languages Act [25 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) In recognition of the special relationship which exists between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people, the Congress has enacted numerous special provisions of law for the benefit of Native Hawaiians in the areas of health, education, labor, and housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) In 1981, the Senate instructed the Office of Education to submit to the Congress a comprehensive report on Native Hawaiian education. The report, entitled the &ldquo;Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Project&rdquo;, was released in 1983 and documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with national norms on standardized achievement tests, were disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics, indicative of special educational needs, and had educational needs which were related to their unique cultural situation, such as different learning styles and low self-image.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) In recognition of the educational needs of Native Hawaiians, in 1988, the Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988 to authorize and develop supplemental educational programs to benefit Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) In 1993, the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate released a ten-year update of the Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the successes of the programs established under title IV of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the same educational needs still exist for Native Hawaiians. For example&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) educational risk factors continue to start even before birth for many Native Hawaiian children, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) late or no prenatal care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) half of Native Hawaiian women who give birth are unmarried; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) high rates of births to teenage parents;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their school experience lagging behind other students in terms of readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score below national norms on standardized education achievement tests at all grade levels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) both public and private schools continue to show a pattern of lower percentages of Native Hawaiian students in the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be overrepresented among students qualifying for special education programs provided to students with learning disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional impairment, and other such disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepresented in institutions of higher education and among adults who have completed four or more years of college;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Native Hawaiians continue to be disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics, indicative of special educational needs, for example&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be retained in grade level and to be excessively absent in secondary school;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1223 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Native Hawaiian students are the highest users of drugs and alcohol in the State of Hawai&lsquo;i; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Native Hawaiian children continue to be disproportionately victimized by child abuse and neglect; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 percent of the students served by the State of Hawai&lsquo;i Department of Education and there are and will continue to be geographically rural, isolated areas with a high Native Hawaiian population density.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (17) are contrary to the high rate of literacy and integration of traditional culture and Western education achieved by Native Hawaiians through a Hawaiian language-based public school system established in 1840 by Kamehameha III.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i in 1893, Hawaiian medium schools were banned. After annexation, throughout the territorial and statehood period, and until 1986, use of Hawaiian as a medium of education in public schools was declared unlawful, thereby causing incalculable harm to a culture that placed a very high value on the power of language, as exemplified in the traditional saying: &ldquo;I ka &lsquo;&#333;lelo no ke ola; I ka &lsquo;&#333;lelo no ka make. In the language rests life; In the language rests death.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) Despite the consequences of over 100 years of nonindigenous influence, the Native Hawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory, and their cultural identity in accordance with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) The State of Hawai&lsquo;i, in the constitution and statutes of the State of Hawai&lsquo;i&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reaffirms and protects the unique right of the Native Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their culture and religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) recognizes the traditional language of the Native Hawaiian people as an official language of the State of Hawai&lsquo;i, which may be used as the language of instruction for all subjects and grades in the public school system.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The attainment of educational success is critical to the betterment of the conditions, long-term well-being and preservation of the culture of Alaska Natives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage the maximum participation by Alaska Natives in the planning and the management of Alaska Native education programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Alaska Native children enter and exit school with serious educational handicaps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The educational achievement of Alaska Native children is far below national norms. In addition to low Native performance on standardized tests, Native student dropout rates are high, and Natives are significantly underrepresented among holders of baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska. As a result, Native students are being denied their opportunity to become full participants in society by grade school and high school educations that are condemning an entire generation to an underclass status and a life of limited choices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The programs authorized herein, combined with expanded Head Start, infant learning and early childhood education programs, and parent education programs are essential if educational handicaps are to be overcome.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic barriers to be overcome in delivering educational services in rural and village Alaska should be addressed through the development and implementation of innovative, model programs in a variety of areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Congress finds that Native children should be afforded the opportunity to begin their formal education on a par with their non-Native peers. The Federal Government should lend support to efforts developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for all students.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) all students can learn to high standards and must develop their talents and realize their potential if the United States is to prosper;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) gifted and talented students are a national resource vital to the future of the Nation and its security and well-being;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) too often schools fail to challenge students to do their best work, and students who are not challenged will not learn to challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards, fully develop their talents, and realize their potential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) unless the special abilities of gifted and talented students are recognized and developed during such students&rsquo; elementary and secondary school years, much of such students&rsquo; special potential for contributing to the national interest is likely to be lost;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) enhancement of parent and student choices among public schools can assist in promoting comprehensive educational reform and give more students the opportunity to learn to challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards, if sufficiently diverse and high-quality choices, and genuine opportunities to take advantage of such choices, are available to all students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) useful examples of such choices can come from States and communities that experiment with methods of offering teachers and other educators, parents, and other members of the public the opportunity to design and implement new public schools and to transform existing public schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) charter schools are a mechanism for testing a variety of educational approaches and <!-- PDFPage:1240 -->should, therefore, be exempted from restrictive rules and regulations if the leadership of such schools commits to attaining specific and ambitious educational results for educationally disadvantaged students consistent with challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards for all students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) charter schools, as such schools have been implemented in a few States, can embody the necessary mixture of enhanced choice, exemption from restrictive regulations, and a focus on learning gains;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) charter schools, including charter schools that are schools-within-schools, can help reduce school size, which reduction can have a significant effect on student achievement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Federal Government should test, evaluate, and disseminate information on a variety of charter school models in order to help demonstrate the benefits of this promising educational reform; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) there is a strong documented need for cash-flow assistance to charter schools that are starting up, because State and local operating revenue streams are not immediately available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part to increase national understanding of the charter schools model by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) providing financial assistance for the planning, program design and initial implementation of charter schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) evaluating the effects of such schools, including the effects on students, student achievement, staff, and parents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) expanding the number of high-quality charter schools available to students across the Nation.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) With local school budget cuts there are inadequate arts and cultural programs available for children and youth in schools, especially at the elementary school level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The arts promote progress in academic subjects as shown by research conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Children and youth who receive instruction in the arts and humanities, or who are involved in cultural activities, remain in school longer and are more successful than children who do not receive such instruction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Learning in the arts and humanities promotes progress in other academic subjects, and generates positive self-esteem and a greater sense of accomplishment in young people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) School-university and school-cultural institution partnerships that upgrade teacher training in the arts and humanities have sig<!-- PDFPage:1248 -->nificantly contributed to improved instruction and achievement levels of school-aged children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Museum outreach, cultural activities and informal education for at-risk children and youth have contributed significantly to the educational achievement and enhanced interest in learning of at-risk children and youth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.], other legislation and local, State and national resources support the integration of the arts and humanities into the regular curriculum and school day for all children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) While all children benefit from instruction in the arts and the humanities, at-risk children and youth have a special, additional need for arts and cultural programs both in school and after school.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subpart is to make demonstration grants to eligible entities to improve the educational performance and future potential of at-risk children and youth by providing comprehensive and coordinated educational and cultural services.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is a worthwhile goal to ensure that all students in America are prepared for responsible citizenship and that all students should have the opportunity to be involved in activities that promote and demonstrate good citizenship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is a worthwhile goal to ensure that America's educators have access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional skills.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Allen J. Ellender, a Senator from Louisiana and President pro tempore of the United States Senate, had a distinguished career in public service characterized by extraordinary energy and real concern for young people. Senator Ellender provided valuable support and encouragement to the Close Up Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit foundation promoting knowledge and understanding of the Federal Government among young people and educators. Therefore, it is a fitting and appropriate tribute to Senator Ellender to provide fellowships in his name to students of limited economic means, the teachers who work with such students, and older Americans, so that such students, teachers, and older Americans may participate in the programs supported by the Close Up Foundation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) public schools, primarily in rural and inner city communities, should collaborate with other public and nonprofit agencies and organizations, local businesses, educational entities (such as vocational and adult education programs, school-to-work programs, community colleges, and universities), recreational, cultural, and other community and human service entities, for the purpose of meeting the needs of, and expanding the opportunities available to, the residents of the communities served by such schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by using school facilities, equipment, and resources, communities can promote a more efficient use of public education facilities, especially in rural and inner city areas where limited financial resources have enhanced the necessity for local public schools to become social service centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the high technology, global economy of the 21st century will require lifelong learning to keep America's workforce competitive and successful, and local public schools should provide centers for lifelong learning and educational opportunities for individuals of all ages; and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ability of the Nation's major urban public school systems to meet the Nation's educational goals will determine the country's economic competitiveness and academic standing in the world community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the quality of public education in the Nation's major urban areas has a direct effect on the economic development of the Nation's inner-cities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the success of urban public schools in boosting the achievement of its minority youth attending such schools will determine the ability of the Nation to close the gap between the &ldquo;haves and the have-nots&rdquo; in society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the cost to America's businesses to provide remedial education to high school graduates is approximately $21,000,000,000 per year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) approximately one-third of the Nation's workforce will be members of minority groups by the year 2000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) urban schools enroll a disproportionately large share of the Nation's poor and &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) urban schools enroll approximately one-third of the Nation's poor, 40 percent of the Nation's African American children, and 30 percent of the Nation's Hispanic youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) nearly 20 percent of the Nation's limited-English-proficient children and 15 percent of the Nation's disabled youth are enrolled in urban public schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the academic performance of students in the average inner-city public school system is below that of students in most other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) urban public school systems have higher dropout rates, more problems with health care, and less parental participation than other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) urban preschoolers have one-half the access to early childhood development programs as do other children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) shortages of teachers in urban public school systems are 2.5 times greater than such shortages in other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) declining numbers of urban minority high school graduates are pursuing postsecondary educational opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) urban public school systems have greater problems with teenage pregnancy, discipline, drug abuse, and gangs than do other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) 75 percent of urban public school buildings are over 25 years old, 33 percent of such buildings are over 50 years old, and such buildings are often in serious disrepair and create poor and demoralizing working and learning conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) solving the challenges facing our Nation's urban schools will require the concerted and collaborative efforts of all levels of government and all sectors of the community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Federal and State funding of urban public schools has not adequately reflected need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) Federal funding that is well-targeted, flexible, and accountable would contribute significantly to addressing the comprehensive needs of inner-city public schools.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8331. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States faces a crisis in writing in schools and in the workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the writing problem has been magnified by the rapidly changing student populations and the growing number of at-risk students due to limited English proficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) over the past two decades, universities and colleges across the country have reported <!-- PDFPage:1264 -->increasing numbers of entering freshmen who are unable to write at a level equal to the demands of college work;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) American businesses and corporations are concerned about the limited writing skills of entry-level workers, and a growing number of executives are reporting that advancement was denied to them due to inadequate writing abilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the writing problem has been magnified by the rapidly changing student populations in the Nation's schools and the growing number of students who are at risk because of limited English proficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) writing and reading are both fundamental to learning, yet writing has been historically neglected in the schools and colleges, and most teachers in the United States elementary schools, secondary schools, and colleges have not been trained to teach writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) since 1973, the only national program to address the writing problem in the Nation's schools has been the National Writing Project, a network of collaborative university-school programs whose goal is to improve the quality of student writing and the teaching of writing at all grade levels and to extend the uses of writing as a learning process through all disciplines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the National Writing Project offers summer and school year inservice teacher training programs and a dissemination network to inform and teach teachers of developments in the field of writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the National Writing Project is a nationally recognized and honored nonprofit organization that recognizes that there are teachers in every region of the country who have developed successful methods for teaching writing and that such teachers can be trained and encouraged to train other teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the National Writing Project has become a model for programs to improve teaching in such other fields as mathematics, science, history, literature, performing arts, and foreign languages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the National Writing Project teacher-teaching-teachers program identifies and promotes what is working in the classrooms of the Nation's best teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the National Writing Project teacher-teaching-teachers project is a positive program that celebrates good teaching practices and good teachers and through its work with schools increases the Nation's corps of successful classroom teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) evaluations of the National Writing Project document the positive impact the project has had on improving the teaching of writing, student performance, and student thinking and learning ability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the National Writing Project programs offer career-long education to teachers, and teachers participating in the National Writing Project receive graduate academic credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) each year over 100,000 teachers voluntarily seek training in National Writing Project intensive summer institutes and workshops and school year in-service programs through one of the 154 regional sites located in 45 States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and in 4 sites that serve United States teachers in United States dependent and independent schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) 250 National Writing Project sites are needed to establish regional sites to serve all teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) private foundation resources, although generous in the past, are inadequate to fund all of the National Writing Project sites needed and the future of the program is in jeopardy without secure financial support;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) independent evaluation studies have found the National Writing Project to be highly cost effective compared to other professional development programs for teachers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) during 1991, the first year of Federal support for the National Writing Project, the National Writing Project matched the $1,951,975 in Federal support with $9,485,504 in matching funds from State, local, and other sources.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Growing numbers of children are negatively affected by influences outside of the classroom which increase such children's risk of academic failure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Factors such as poor nutrition, unsafe living conditions, physical and sexual abuse, family and gang violence, inadequate health care, unemployment, lack of child care, and substance abuse, adversely affect family relationships and the ability of a child to learn.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Parents and other caregivers in today's high pressure society often face demands which place restraints on such parents&rsquo; and caregivers&rsquo; time and affect such parents&rsquo; and caregivers&rsquo; ability to adequately provide for the needs of the families of such parents and caregivers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Access to health and social service programs can address the basic physical and emotional needs of children so that children can fully participate in the learning experiences offered children in school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Services for at-risk students need to be more convenient, and less fragmented, regulated and duplicative, in order to meet the needs of children and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) School personnel, parents, and support service providers often lack knowledge of, and access to, available services for at-risk students and their families in the community, and have few resources to coordinate services and make services accessible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Service providers, such as teachers, social workers, health care and child care providers, juvenile justice workers and others, are often trained in separate disciplines that provide little support for the coordination of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Coordination of services is more cost effective because such coordination substitutes prevention for expensive crisis intervention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Coordinating health and social services with education can help the Nation meet the National Education Goals by ensuring better outcomes for children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose of coordinating services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to provide elementary and secondary school students and their families better access to the social, health and education services necessary for students to succeed in school and for their families to take an active role in ensuring that such students receive the best possible education.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) According to a 1991 survey conducted by the American Association of School Administrators, 74 percent of all public school buildings in the United States need to be replaced.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1268 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Almost one-third of such buildings were built prior to World War II.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) It is estimated that one of every four public school buildings in the United States is in inadequate condition, and of such buildings, 61 percent need maintenance or major repairs, 43 percent are obsolete, 42 percent contain environmental hazards, 25 percent are overcrowded, and 13 percent are structurally unsound.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Large numbers of local educational agencies have difficulties securing financing for school facility improvement, including school libraries, media centers, and facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Improving the quality of public elementary and secondary schools will help our Nation meet the National Education Goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The challenges facing our Nation's public elementary and secondary schools require the concerted and collaborative efforts of all levels of government and all sectors of the community.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in order to increase our Nation's standard of living and to increase the number of good jobs, the United States must increase its productivity and ability to compete in the international marketplace by improving the educational level of our workforce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) although efforts are being made to establish higher educational standards and goals, there is a substantial shortage of resources to meet such standards and goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) States and local communities are finding it increasingly difficult to meet ever higher educational standards and goals, and States will not be able to fund needed changes without Federal help to reach such standards and goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Federal Government has established many educational programs but failed to provide adequate funding for such programs, for example one such program provides education to our Nation's disabled students and was established with a promise of 40 percent Federal funding but currently receives only eight percent Federal funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the annual shortfall in Federal education programs is approximately half of the promised funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) many needed educational improvements will not need Federal funds, however, other suggested changes such as lengthened school years, better pay, after-school activities, mentoring for students at risk, programs for gifted students, and replacing substandard buildings, will require substantial Federal assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Federal contribution to education is less than two percent of the total Federal budget, and in order to make education a national priority, the total percentage of Federal educational funding should be increased by one percent each year over the next eight years to reach 10 percent of the total Federal budget.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the total share of the Federal spending on education should increase by at least one percent each year until such share reaches 10 percent of the total Federal budget.</p>
