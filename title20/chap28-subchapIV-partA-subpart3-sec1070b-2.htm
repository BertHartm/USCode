<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) agrees that the Federal share of awards under this subpart will not exceed 75 percent of such awards, except that the Federal share may be exceeded if the Secretary determines, pursuant to regulations establishing objective criteria for such determinations, that a larger Federal share is required to further the purpose of this subpart; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) agrees that the non-Federal share of awards made under this subpart shall be made from the institution's own resources, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) makes application at a time and in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Secretary and that institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Selection of individuals and determination of amount of awards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From among individuals who are eligible for supplemental grants for each fiscal year, the institution shall, in accordance with the agreement under section 1094 of this title, and within the amount allocated to the institution for that purpose for that year under section 1070b&ndash;3 of this title, select individuals who are to be awarded such grants and determine, in accordance with section 1070b&ndash;1 of this title, the amounts to be paid to them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1) of this subsection, each institution of higher education shall, in the agreement made under section 1094 of this title, assure that the selection procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) will be designed to award supplemental grants under this subpart, first, to students with exceptional need, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the institution's allocation under this subpart is directly or indirectly based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students who are independent students or attending the institution less than full time and if the total financial need of all such students attending the institution exceeds 5 percent of the total financial need of all students attending such institution, then at least 5 percent of such allotment shall be made available to such students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use and transfer of funds for administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall provide that funds granted to an institution of higher education may be used only to make payments to students participating in a grant program authorized under this subpart, except that an institution may use a portion of the sums allocated to it under this subpart to meet administrative expenses in accordance with section 1096 of this title.</p>
