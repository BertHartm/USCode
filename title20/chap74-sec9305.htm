[and 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.]).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reimbursement under certain circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a participant in the Troops-to-Teachers Program fails to obtain teacher certification or licensure or employment as an elementary or secondary school teacher or vocational or technical teacher as required by the agreement under section 9304(e) of this title or voluntarily leaves, or is terminated for cause, from the employment during the four years of required service in violation of the agreement, the participant shall be required to reimburse the administering Secretary for any stipend paid to the participant under subsection (a) of this section in an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of the stipend as the unserved portion of required service bears to the four years of required service.</p>
