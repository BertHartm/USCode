<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commitments to graduate students</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An academic department or program of an institution of higher education shall make commitments to graduate students (including students pursuing a doctoral degree after having completed a master's degree program at an institution of higher education) at any point in their graduate study to provide stipends for the length of time necessary for a student to complete the course of graduate study, but in no case longer than 5 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No such commitments shall be made to students under this part unless the academic department or program has determined adequate <!-- PDFPage:568 -->funds are available to fulfill the commitment either from funds received or anticipated under this part, or from institutional funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of stipends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make payments to institutions of higher education for the purpose of paying stipends to individuals who are awarded fellowships under this part. The stipends the Secretary establishes shall reflect the purpose of this program to encourage highly talented students to undertake graduate study as described in this part. In the case of an individual who receives such individual's first stipend under this part in academic year 1993  1994 or any succeeding academic year, such stipend shall be set at a level of support equal to that provided by the National Science Foundation graduate fellowships, except such amount shall be adjusted as necessary so as not to exceed the fellow's demonstrated level of need according to measurements of need approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of institutional payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An institution of higher education that makes institutional payments for tuition and fees on behalf of individuals supported by fellowships under this part in amounts that exceed the institutional payments made by the Secretary pursuant to section 1134q(a) of this title may count such payments toward the amounts the institution is required to provide pursuant to section 1134<em>o</em>(b)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Academic progress required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, no student shall receive an award&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except during periods in which such student is maintaining satisfactory progress in, and devoting essentially full time to, study or research in the field in which such fellowship was awarded, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the student is engaging in gainful employment other than part-time employment involved in teaching, research, or similar activities determined by the institution to be in support of the student's progress towards a degree.</p>
