<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This chapter may be cited as the &ldquo;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are more than eight million children with disabilities in the United States today;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the special educational needs of such children are not being fully met;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) more than half of the children with disabilities in the United States do not receive appropriate educational services which would enable them to have full equality of opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) one million of the children with disabilities in the United States are excluded entirely from the public school system and will not go through the educational process with their peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there are many children with disabilities throughout the United States participating in regular school programs whose disabilities prevent them from having a successful educational experience because their disabilities are undetected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) because of the lack of adequate services within the public school system, families are often forced to find services outside the public school system, often at great distance from their residence and at their own expense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) developments in the training of teachers and in diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods have advanced to the point that, given appropriate funding, State and local educational agencies can and will provide effective special education and related services to meet the needs of children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) State and local educational agencies have a responsibility to provide education for all children with disabilities, but present financial resources are inadequate to meet the special educational needs of children with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) it is in the national interest that the Federal Government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities in order to assure equal protection of the law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them, within the time periods specified in section 1412(2)(B) of this title, a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct at least 1 site visit for each grant, contract, and cooperative agreement receiving $300,000 or more annually under subchapters III through VII of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Discretionary program findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to the discretionary programs authorized by subchapters III through VII of this chapter, the Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The Federal Government must be responsive to the growing needs of an increasingly more diverse society. A more equitable allocation of resources is essential for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) America's racial profile is rapidly changing. While the rate of increase for white Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Hispanics, 14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1 percent for Asians and other ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) By the year 2000, this Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three of whom will be either African-American, Hispanic, or Asian-American.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Taken together as a group, it is a more frequent phenomenon for minorities to comprise the majority of public school students. Large city school populations are overwhelmingly minority, e.g., Miami, 71 percent; Philadelphia, 73 percent; Baltimore, 80 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Recruitment efforts within special education at the level of preservice, continuing education, and practice must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) The limited English proficient population is the fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in many parts of our Nation. In the Nation's 2 largest school districts, limited-English students make up almost half of all students initially entering school at the kindergarten level. Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the levels of referral and placement of limited-English proficient children in special education. The Department of Education has found that services provided to limited-English proficient students often do not respond primarily to the pupil's academic needs. These trends pose special challenges for special education in the referral, assessment, and services for our Nation's students from non-English language backgrounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) More minority children continue to be served in special education than would be expected from the percentage of minority students in the general school population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Poor African-American children are 3.5 times more likely to be identified by their teacher as mentally retarded than their white counterpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Although African-Americans represent 12 percent of elementary and secondary enrollments, they constitute 28 percent of total enrollments in special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) The drop out rate is 68 percent higher for minorities than for whites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) More than 50 percent of minority students in large cities drop out of school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) The opportunity for full participation in awards for grants and contracts; boards of organizations receiving funds under this chapter; and peer review panels; and training of professionals in the area of special education by minority individuals, organizations, and historically Black colleges and universities is essential if we are to obtain greater success in the education of minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) In 1989, of the 661,000 college and university professors, 4.6 percent were African-American and 3.1 percent were Hispanic. Of the 3,600,000 teachers, prekindergarten through high school, 9.4 percent were African-American and 3.9 percent were Hispanic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Students from minority groups comprise more than 50 percent of K&ndash;12 public school enrollment in seven States yet minority enrollment in teacher training programs is less than 15 percent in all but six States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) As the number of African-American and Hispanic students in special education increases, the number of minority teachers and related service personnel produced in our colleges and universities continues to decrease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Ten years ago, 12.5 percent of the United States teaching force in public elementary and secondary schools were members of a minority group. Minorities comprised 21.3 percent of the national population at that time and were clearly underrepresented then among employed teachers. Today, the elementary and secondary teaching force is 3 to 5 percent minority, while one-third of the students in public schools are minority children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) As recently as 1984&ndash;85, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) supplied nearly half of the African-American teachers in the Nation. However, in 1988, HBCUs received only 2 percent of the discretionary funds for special education and related services personnel training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) While African-American students constitute 28 percent of total enrollment in spe<!-- PDFPage:692 -->cial education, only 11.2 percent of individuals enrolled in preservice training programs for special education are African-American.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) In 1986&ndash;87, of the degrees conferred in education at the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D levels, only 6, 8, and 8 percent, respectively, were awarded to African-American or Hispanic students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Minorities and underserved persons are socially disadvantaged because of the lack of opportunities in training and educational programs, undergirded by the practices in the private sector that impede their full participation in the mainstream of society.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress further finds that these conditions can be greatly improved by providing opportunities for the full participation of minorities through the implementation of the following recommendations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Implementation of a policy to mobilize the Nation's resources to prepare minorities for careers in special education and related services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) This policy should focus on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the recruitment of minorities into teaching; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) financially assisting HBCUs and other institutions of higher education (whose minority student enrollment is at least 25 percent) to prepare students for special education and related service careers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) The Secretary shall develop a plan for providing outreach services to the entities described in clause (ii) in order to increase the participation of such entities in competitions for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under any of subchapters III through VII of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The entities referred to in clause (i) are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions of higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 25 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) eligible institutions as defined in section 1058 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) nonprofit and for-profit agencies at least 51 percent owned or controlled by one or more minority individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) underrepresented populations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) For the purpose of implementing the plan required in clause (i), the Secretary shall, for each of the fiscal years 1991 through 1994, expend 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year involved for carrying out subchapters III through VII of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall exercise his/her utmost authority, resourcefulness, and diligence to meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Not later than January 31 of each year, starting with fiscal year 1991, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a final report on the progress toward meeting the goals of this subsection during the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a full explanation of any progress toward meeting the goals of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a plan to meet the goals, if necessary.</p>
