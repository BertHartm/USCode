<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This chapter may be cited as the &ldquo;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to participate in or contribute to society. Improving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Before the date of the enactment of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94&ndash;142)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the special educational needs of children with disabilities were not being fully met;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more than one-half of the children with disabilities in the United States did not receive appropriate educational services that would enable such children to have full equality of opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) 1,000,000 of the children with disabilities in the United States were excluded entirely from the public school system and did not go through the educational process with their peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) there were many children with disabilities throughout the United States participating in regular school programs whose disabilities prevented such children from having a successful educational experience because their disabilities were undetected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) because of the lack of adequate services within the public school system, families were often forced to find services outside the public school system, often at great distance from their residence and at their own expense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this chapter has been successful in <!-- PDFPage:631 -->ensuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education and in improving educational results for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) However, the implementation of this chapter has been impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching and learning for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Over 20 years of research and experience has demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) having high expectations for such children and ensuring their access in the general curriculum to the maximum extent possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) strengthening the role of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) coordinating this chapter with other local, educational service agency, State, and Federal school improvement efforts in order to ensure that such children benefit from such efforts and that special education can become a service for such children rather than a place where they are sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) providing appropriate special education and related services and aids and supports in the regular classroom to such children, whenever appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) supporting high-quality, intensive professional development for all personnel who work with such children in order to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to enable them&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to meet developmental goals and, to the maximum extent possible, those challenging expectations that have been established for all children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to be prepared to lead productive, independent, adult lives, to the maximum extent possible;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) providing incentives for whole-school approaches and pre-referral intervention to reduce the need to label children as disabled in order to address their learning needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) focusing resources on teaching and learning while reducing paperwork and requirements that do not assist in improving educational results.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) While States, local educational agencies, and educational service agencies are responsible for providing an education for all children with disabilities, it is in the national interest that the Federal Government have a role in assisting State and local efforts to educate children with disabilities in order to improve results for such children and to ensure equal protection of the law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the growing needs of an increasingly more diverse society. A more equitable allocation of resources is essential for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) America's racial profile is rapidly changing. Between 1980 and 1990, the rate of increase in the population for white Americans was 6 percent, while the rate of increase for racial and ethnic minorities was much higher: 53 percent for Hispanics, 13.2 percent for African-Americans, and 107.8 percent for Asians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) By the year 2000, this Nation will have 275,000,000 people, nearly one of every three of whom will be either African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American, or American Indian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Taken together as a group, minority children are comprising an ever larger percentage of public school students. Large-city school populations are overwhelmingly minority, for example: for fall 1993, the figure for Miami was 84 percent; Chicago, 89 percent; Philadelphia, 78 percent; Baltimore, 84 percent; Houston, 88 percent; and Los Angeles, 88 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Recruitment efforts within special education must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The limited English proficient population is the fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in many parts of our Nation. In the Nation's 2 largest school districts, limited English proficient students make up almost half of all students initially entering school at the kindergarten level. Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the levels of referral and placement of limited English proficient children in special education. The Department of Education has found that services provided to limited English proficient students often do not respond primarily to the pupil's academic needs. These trends pose special challenges for special education in the referral, assessment, and services for our Nation's students from non-English language backgrounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) More minority children continue to be served in special education than would be expected from the percentage of minority students in the general school population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Poor African-American children are 2.3 times more likely to be identified by their teacher as having mental retardation than their white counterpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Although African-Americans represent 16 percent of elementary and secondary enrollments, they constitute 21 percent of total enrollments in special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The drop-out rate is 68 percent higher for minorities than for whites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) More than 50 percent of minority students in large cities drop out of school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9)(A) The opportunity for full participation in awards for grants and contracts; boards of organizations receiving funds under this chapter; and peer review panels; and training of professionals in the area of special education by minority individuals, organizations, and <!-- PDFPage:632 -->historically black colleges and universities is essential if we are to obtain greater success in the education of minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In 1993, of the 915,000 college and university professors, 4.9 percent were African-American and 2.4 percent were Hispanic. Of the 2,940,000 teachers, prekindergarten through high school, 6.8 percent were African-American and 4.1 percent were Hispanic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Students from minority groups comprise more than 50 percent of K&ndash;12 public school enrollment in seven States yet minority enrollment in teacher training programs is less than 15 percent in all but six States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) As the number of African-American and Hispanic students in special education increases, the number of minority teachers and related service personnel produced in our colleges and universities continues to decrease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Ten years ago, 12 percent of the United States teaching force in public elementary and secondary schools were members of a minority group. Minorities comprised 21 percent of the national population at that time and were clearly underrepresented then among employed teachers. Today, the elementary and secondary teaching force is 13 percent minority, while one-third of the students in public schools are minority children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) As recently as 1991, historically black colleges and universities enrolled 44 percent of the African-American teacher trainees in the Nation. However, in 1993, historically black colleges and universities received only 4 percent of the discretionary funds for special education and related services personnel training under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) While African-American students constitute 28 percent of total enrollment in special education, only 11.2 percent of individuals enrolled in preservice training programs for special education are African-American.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) In 1986&ndash;87, of the degrees conferred in education at the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. levels, only 6, 8, and 8 percent, respectively, were awarded to African-American or Hispanic students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Minorities and underserved persons are socially disadvantaged because of the lack of opportunities in training and educational programs, undergirded by the practices in the private sector that impede their full participation in the mainstream of society.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to assist States, localities, educational service agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education of all children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist States in the implementation of a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ensure that educators and parents have the necessary tools to improve educational results for children with disabilities by supporting systemic-change activities; coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and technology development and media services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to assess, and ensure the effectiveness of, efforts to educate children with disabilities.</p>
