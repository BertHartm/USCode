<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State educational agency may waive, in whole or in part, the Federal share described in paragraph (1) for an eligible entity if the entity&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1099 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) negotiates an agreement with the State educational agency with respect to the amount of the remaining cost to which the waiver will be applicable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Federal funds provided under this subpart may not be used for the indirect costs of a program assisted under this subpart, except that the Secretary may waive this paragraph if an eligible recipient of funds reserved under section 6381a(a)(1)(C) of this title demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the recipient otherwise would not be able to participate in the program assisted under this subpart.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priority</h4>
