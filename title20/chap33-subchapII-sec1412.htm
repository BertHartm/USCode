<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State is eligible for assistance under this subchapter for a fiscal year if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets each of the following conditions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Free appropriate public education</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities residing in the State between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The obligation to make a free appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities does not apply with respect to children:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) aged 3 through 5 and 18 through 21 in a State to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, respecting the provision of public education to children in those age ranges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) aged 18 through 21 to the extent that State law does not require that special education and related services under this subchapter be provided to children with disabilities who, in the educational placement prior to their incarceration in an adult correctional facility:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) were not actually identified as being a child with a disability under section 1401(3) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) did not have an individualized education program under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Full educational opportunity goal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State has established a goal of providing full educational opportunity to all children with disabilities and a detailed timetable for accomplishing that goal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Child find</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All children with disabilities residing in the State, including children with disabilities attending private schools, regardless of <!-- PDFPage:675 -->the severity of their disabilities, and who are in need of special education and related services, are identified, located, and evaluated and a practical method is developed and implemented to determine which children with disabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this chapter requires that children be classified by their disability so long as each child who has a disability listed in section 1401 of this title and who, by reason of that disability, needs special education and related services is regarded as a child with a disability under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Individualized education program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individualized education program, or an individualized family service plan that meets the requirements of section 1436(d) of this title, is developed, reviewed, and revised for each child with a disability in accordance with section 1414(d) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Least restrictive environment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional requirement</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the State uses a funding mechanism by which the State distributes State funds on the basis of the type of setting in which a child is served, the funding mechanism does not result in placements that violate the requirements of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Assurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the State does not have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with clause (i), the State shall provide the Secretary an assurance that it will revise the funding mechanism as soon as feasible to ensure that such mechanism does not result in such placements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Procedural safeguards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Children with disabilities and their parents are afforded the procedural safeguards required by section 1415 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional procedural safeguards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Procedures to ensure that testing and evaluation materials and procedures utilized for the purposes of evaluation and placement of children with disabilities will be selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory. Such materials or procedures shall be provided and administered in the child's native language or mode of communication, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, and no single procedure shall be the sole criterion for determining an appropriate educational program for a child.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Children with disabilities are evaluated in accordance with subsections (a) through (c) of section 1414 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Confidentiality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Agencies in the State comply with section 1417(c) of this title (relating to the confidentiality of records and information).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Transition from subchapter III to preschool programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Children participating in early-intervention programs assisted under subchapter III of this chapter, and who will participate in preschool programs assisted under this subchapter, experience a smooth and effective transition to those preschool programs in a manner consistent with section 1437(a)(8) of this title. By the third birthday of such a child, an individualized education program or, if consistent with sections 1414(d)(2)(B) and 1436(d) of this title, an individualized family service plan, has been developed and is being implemented for the child. The local educational agency will participate in transition planning conferences arranged by the designated lead agency under section 1437(a)(8) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Children in private schools</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Children enrolled in private schools by their parents</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">To the extent consistent with the number and location of children with disabilities in the State who are enrolled by their parents in private elementary and secondary schools, provision is made for the participation of those children in the program assisted or carried out under this subchapter by providing for such children special education and related services in accordance with the following requirements, unless the Secretary has arranged for services to those children under subsection (f) of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Amounts expended for the provision of those services by a local educational agency shall be equal to a proportionate amount of Federal funds made available under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) Such services may be provided to children with disabilities on the premises of private, including parochial, schools, to the extent consistent with law.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Child-find requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The requirements of paragraph (3) of this subsection (relating to child find) shall apply with respect to children with disabilities in the State who are enrolled in private, including parochial, elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:676 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Children placed in, or referred to, private schools by public agencies</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Children with disabilities in private schools and facilities are provided special education and related services, in accordance with an individualized education program, at no cost to their parents, if such children are placed in, or referred to, such schools or facilities by the State or appropriate local educational agency as the means of carrying out the requirements of this subchapter or any other applicable law requiring the provision of special education and related services to all children with disabilities within such State.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In all cases described in clause (i), the State educational agency shall determine whether such schools and facilities meet standards that apply to State and local educational agencies and that children so served have all the rights they would have if served by such agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Payment for education of children enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral by the public agency</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to subparagraph (A), this subchapter does not require a local educational agency to pay for the cost of education, including special education and related services, of a child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in such private school or facility.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Reimbursement for private school placement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private elementary or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Limitation on reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The cost of reimbursement described in clause (ii) may be reduced or denied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) at the most recent IEP meeting that the parents attended prior to removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not inform the IEP Team that they were rejecting the placement proposed by the public agency to provide a free appropriate public education to their child, including stating their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private school at public expense; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) 10 business days (including any holidays that occur on a business day) prior to the removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not give written notice to the public agency of the information described in division (aa);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if, prior to the parents&rsquo; removal of the child from the public school, the public agency informed the parents, through the notice requirements described in section 1415(b)(7) of this title, of its intent to evaluate the child (including a statement of the purpose of the evaluation that was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did not make the child available for such evaluation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to actions taken by the parents.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding the notice requirement in clause (iii)(I), the cost of reimbursement may not be reduced or denied for failure to provide such notice if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the parent is illiterate and cannot write in English;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) compliance with clause (iii)(I) would likely result in physical or serious emotional harm to the child;</p>
