<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) today, while the role of the current Department of Education is much broader, the National Center for Education Statistics within the Office of Educational Research and Improvement continues to perform those crucial original purposes; and</p>
