<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) certifies the eligibility of the student to receive a loan under this section and the amount of the loan for which such student is eligible, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of amount of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) of this section shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility <!-- PDFPage:325 -->of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loan limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the annual and aggregate limits for loans under this section shall be the same as those established under section 1078(b)(1) of this title, less any amount received by such student pursuant to the subsidized loan program established under section 1078 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual limits for independent, graduate, and professional students</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a student at an eligible institution who has successfully completed such first and second years but has not successfully completed the remainder of a program of undergraduate education&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) $5,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such student is enrolled in a program of undergraduate education, the remainder of which is less than one academic year, the maximum annual loan amount that such student may receive may not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount specified in subclause (I) as such remainder measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours bears to one academic year;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of such a student who is a graduate or professional student attending an eligible institution, $10,000.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of principal and interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commencement of repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Repayment of principal on loans made under this section shall begin at the beginning of the repayment period described in section 1078(b)(7) of this title. Not less than 30 days prior to the anticipated commencement of such repayment period, the holder of such loan shall provide notice to the borrower that interest will accrue before repayment begins and of the borrower's option to begin loan repayment at an earlier date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Capitalization of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest on loans made under this section for which payments of principal are not required during the in-school and grace periods or for which payments are deferred under sections 1077(a)(2)(C) and 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title shall, if agreed upon by the borrower and the lender (A) be paid monthly or quarterly, or (B) be added to the principal amount of the loan not more frequently than quarterly by the lender. Such capitalization of interest shall not be deemed to exceed the annual insurable limit on account of the student.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the periodic payment and the repayment schedule for any loan made pursuant to this section shall be established by assuming an interest rate equal to the applicable rate of interest at the time the repayment of the principal amount of the loan commences. At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Repayment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of calculating the 10-year repayment period under section 1078(b)(1)(D) of this title, such period shall commence at the time the first payment of principal is due from the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Origination fee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of origination fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lender shall charge the borrower an origination fee in the amount of 3.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan, to be deducted proportionately from each installment payment of the proceeds of the loan prior to payment to the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Relation to applicable interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such origination fee shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining compliance with section 1077a of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:326 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disclosure required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lender shall disclose to the borrower the amount and method of calculating the origination fee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of origination fee to offset default costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each lender making loans under this section shall transmit all origination fees authorized to be collected from borrowers to the Secretary, who shall use such fees to pay the Federal costs of default claims paid for loans under this section and to reduce the cost of special allowances paid thereon, if any, under section 1087  1(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of origination fee and insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In fiscal year 1995, the Secretary is directed to analyze the risk rates of borrowers who have participated in this program in the 2 previous fiscal years. If the Secretary finds, that as a result of this review, the projected defaults and special allowance costs of the unsubsidized program do not exceed the combined origination fee under this subsection and the insurance premium under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary is directed to lower the origination fee and insurance premium accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Single application form and loan repayment schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A guaranty agency shall use a single application form and a single repayment schedule for subsidized Federal Stafford loans made pursuant to section 1078 of this title and for unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans made pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State or nonprofit private institution or organization having an agreement with the Secretary under section 1078(b)(1) of this title may charge a borrower under this section an insurance premium equal to not more than 1.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan, if such premium will not be used for incentive payments to lenders.</p>
