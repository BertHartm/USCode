<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on <!-- PDFPage:390 -->loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of special allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), and (I) and paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans shall be computed (i) by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such 3-month period, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rate on such loans from such average, (iii) by adding 3.10 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations, the income from which is exempt from taxation under title 26 shall be one-half the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), except that, in determining the rate for the purpose of this clause, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interests or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds. This subparagraph shall not apply to loans which were made or insured prior to October 1, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The quarterly rate of the special allowance set under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall not be less than 9.5 percent minus the applicable interest rate on such loans, divided by 4.</p>

Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interest or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance shall be the rate determined under subparagraph (A), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (I) of this paragraph, or paragraph (4), as the case may be, for a holder of loans that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) were made or purchased with funds&mdash;</p>
