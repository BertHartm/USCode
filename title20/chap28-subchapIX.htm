<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reservations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reserve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 50 percent of the amount appropriated pursuant to the authority of section 1134g of this title to award grants to institutions of higher education to enable such institutions to make awards for master's level and professional study; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to individuals who first receive fellowships during or after academic year 1993&ndash;1994&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) $9,000 for the academic year 1993&ndash;1994; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for succeeding academic years, $9,000 adjusted annually thereafter in accordance with inflation as determined by the Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for the previous calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of stipends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make payments to institutions of higher education for the purpose of paying stipends to individuals who are awarded fellowships under this part.
