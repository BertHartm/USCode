Such a system shall include procedures to aggregate the determinations for each school site to determine the amount needed to fund all Bureau funded schools, to prepare a budget submission based upon such aggregate, and to provide for a mechanism for distributing such sums as may be appropriated based upon the determination at each school site.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:944 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Results report</h4>
