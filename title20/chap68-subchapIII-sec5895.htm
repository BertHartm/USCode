<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Interior shall reserve from the funds received pursuant to section 5884(a)(1)(B) of this title in the first and second fiscal year for which the Secretary of the Interior receives such funds an amount not to exceed $500,000 for each such year to provide, through a contract executed, after open solicitation, with an organization or institution having extensive experience in school finance, for an analysis of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cost analysis purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of the cost analysis provided for in paragraph (1)(A) shall be to provide the Bureau and the panel described in subsection (b)(4) of this section with baseline data regarding the current state of operations funded by the Bureau and to provide a framework for the implementation of opportunity-to-learn standards or strategies.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For the purposes of the feasibility analysis described in paragraph (1)(B), the term &ldquo;school-based budget system&rdquo; means a system based upon an initial determination, at each school site, of the number of students who shall be served at the site, the needs of those students, the standards which will best meet those needs (including any standards or conditions reflecting local community input and such community's program), the personnel profile necessary to establish such program and the cost (determined on an actual basis) of funding such a program. Such a system shall include procedures to aggregate the determinations for each school site to determine the amount needed to fund all Bureau funded schools, to prepare a budget submission based upon such aggregate, and to provide for a mechanism for distributing such sums as may be appropriated based upon the determination at each school site.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Results report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The contractor selected shall be required to report the results of analyses provided for in this section, in aggregate and school-specific form to the chairpersons and ranking minority members of the Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee on Appropria<!-- PDFPage:1058 -->tions of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, and to the Secretary of the Interior, not later than six months after October 20, 1994.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Study</h4>
