<h4 class="note-head">References in Text</h4>
<p class="note-body">This title, referred to in text, is title II of Pub. L. 93&ndash;516, Dec. 7, 1974, 88 Stat. 1617, as amended, known as the &ldquo;Randolph-Sheppard Act Amendments of 1974&rdquo;. For complete classification of such title to the Code, see Short Title of 1974 Amendment note set out under section 107 of this title and Tables.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section was enacted as part of the Randolph-Sheppard Act Amendments of 1974, and not as part of the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act which comprises this chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">The content of Pub. L. 93&ndash;516, including provisions of section 209 thereof which enacted this section, were originally contained in H.R. 14225, 93rd Congress, Second Session, which was pocket-vetoed during the 31-day intrasession adjournment of the 93rd Congress for the Congressional elections in November, 1974.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (<em>Kennedy v. Jones</em>, D.C.D.C. 1976, 412 F.Supp. 353) H.R. 14225 was deemed to have become law without the approval of the President on Nov. 21, 1974, and was given the designation Pub. L. 93&ndash;651. Therefore, for purposes of codification, this section should be deemed to have been enacted by Pub. L. 93&ndash;651, title II, &sect;209, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2&ndash;15, in exactly the same manner as it was enacted by Pub. L. 93&ndash;516.</p>
