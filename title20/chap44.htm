<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, make grants pursuant to this section to tribally controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institutions that are not receiving Federal support under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) or the Navajo Community College Act (25 U.S.C. 640a et seq.) to provide basic support for the education and training of Indian students.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for grants under this section are not sufficient to pay in full the total amount which approved applicants are eligible to receive under this section for such fiscal year, the Secretary shall first allocate to each such applicant who received funds under this part for the preceding fiscal year an amount equal to 100 percent of the product of the per capita payment for the preceding fiscal year and such applicant's Indian student count for the current program year, plus an amount equal to the actual cost of any increase to the per capita figure resulting from inflationary increases to necessary costs beyond the institution's control.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Per capita determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of paragraph (1), the per capita payment for any fiscal year shall be determined by dividing the amount available for grants to tribally controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institutions under this section for such program year by the sum of the Indian student counts of such institutions for such program year. The Secretary shall, on the basis of the most accurate data available from the institutions, compute the Indian student count for any fiscal year for which such count was not used for the purpose of making allocations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any tribally controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institution that is not receiving Federal support under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) or the Navajo Community College Act (25 U.S.C. 640a et seq.) that desires to receive a grant under this section shall submit an application to the Secretary in such manner and form as the Secretary may require.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition on alteration of grant amount</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prohibition on contract denial</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No tribally controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institution for which an Indian tribe has designated a portion of the funds appropriated for the tribe from funds appropriated under section 13 of title 25 may be denied a contract for such portion under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] (except as provided in that Act), or denied appropriate contract support to administer such portion of the appropriated funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Needs estimate and report on facilities and facilities improvement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Needs estimate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, based on the most accurate data available from the institutions and Indian tribes whose Indian students are served under this section, and in consideration of employment needs, economic development needs, population training needs, and facilities needs, prepare an actual budget needs estimate for each institution eligible under this section for each subsequent program year, and submit such budget needs estimate to Congress in such a timely manner as will enable the appropriate committees of Congress to consider such needs data for purposes of the uninterrupted flow of adequate appropriations to such institutions.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Maintenance of effort</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), no payments shall be made under this chapter for any fiscal year to a State for vocational and technical education programs or tech-prep programs unless the Secretary determines that the fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of such State for vocational and technical education programs for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made, equaled or exceeded such effort or expenditures for vocational and technical education programs, for the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In computing the fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall exclude capital expenditures, special one-time project costs, and the cost of pilot programs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Decrease in Federal support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the amount made available for vocational and technical education programs under this chapter for a fiscal year is less than the amount made available for vocational and technical education programs under this chapter for the preceding fiscal year, then the fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of a State required by subparagraph (B) for such preceding fiscal year shall be decreased by the same percentage as the percentage decrease in the amount so made available.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may waive the requirements of this section, with respect to not more than 5 percent of expenditures by any eligible agency for 1 fiscal year only, on making a determination that such waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the ability of the eligible agency to meet such requirements, such as a natural disaster or an unforeseen and precipitous decline in financial resources. No level of funding permitted under such a waiver may be used as the basis for computing the fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures required under this section for years subsequent to the year covered by such waiver. The fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the subsequent years shall be computed on the basis of the level of funding that would, but for such waiver, have been required.</p>
