<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1471. Findings and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Federal Government has an ongoing obligation to support programs, projects, and activities that contribute to positive results for children with disabilities, enabling them&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to meet their early intervention, educational, and transitional goals and, to the maximum extent possible, educational standards that have been established for all children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to acquire the skills that will empower them to lead productive and independent adult lives.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) As a result of more than 20 years of Federal support for research, demonstration projects, and personnel preparation, there is an important knowledge base for improving results for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such knowledge should be used by States and local educational agencies to design and implement state-of-the-art educational systems that consider the needs of, and include, children with disabilities, especially in environments in which they can learn along with their peers and achieve results measured by the same standards as the results of their peers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Continued Federal support is essential for the development and maintenance of a coordinated and high-quality program of research, demonstration projects, dissemination of information, and personnel preparation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such support&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) enables State educational agencies and local educational agencies to improve their educational systems and results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) enables State and local agencies to improve early intervention services and results for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) enhances the opportunities for general and special education personnel, related services personnel, parents, and paraprofessionals to participate in pre-service and in-service training, to collaborate, and to improve results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Federal Government plays a critical role in facilitating the availability of an adequate number of qualified personnel&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to serve effectively the over 5,000,000 children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to assume leadership positions in administrative and direct-service capacities related to teacher training and research concerning the provision of early intervention services, special education, and related services; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) National technical assistance, support, and dissemination activities are necessary to ensure that subchapters II and III of this chapter are fully implemented and achieve quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Parents, teachers, administrators, and related services personnel need technical assistance and information in a timely, coordinated, and accessible manner in order to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results at the State and local levels for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Parent training and information activities have taken on increased importance in efforts to assist parents of a child with a disability in dealing with the multiple pressures of rearing such a child and are of particular importance in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensuring the involvement of such parents in planning and decisionmaking with respect to early intervention, educational, and transitional services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) achieving quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) providing such parents information on their rights and protections under this chapter to ensure improved early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) assisting such parents in the development of skills to participate effectively in the education and development of their children and in the transitions described in section 1474(b)(3)(C) of this title; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Providers of parent training and information activities need to ensure that such parents who have limited access to services and supports, due to economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers, are provided with access to appropriate parent training and information activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Parents of children with disabilities need information that helps the parents to understand the rights and responsibilities of their children under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The provision of coordinated technical assistance and dissemination of information to State and local agencies, institutions of higher education, and other providers of services to children with disabilities is essential in&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal support for carrying out technology research, technology development, and educational media services and activities has resulted in major innovations that have significantly improved early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Such Federal support is needed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to stimulate the development of software, interactive learning tools, and devices to address early intervention, educational, and transitional needs of children with disabilities who have certain disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to make information available on technology research, technology development, and educational media services and activities to individuals involved in the provision of early intervention, educational, and transitional services to children with disabilities;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:714 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to promote the integration of technology into curricula to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to assist children with disabilities and their families in using such devices, tools, services, and activities; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) to coordinate the provision of such devices, tools, services, and activities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) among State human services programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) between such programs and private agencies.</p>
