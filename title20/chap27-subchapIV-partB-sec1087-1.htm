<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of special allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) and paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans shall be computed (i) by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such 3-month period, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rate on such loans from such average, (iii) by adding 3.10 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations, the income from which is exempt from taxation under title 26 shall be one-half the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), except that, in determining the rate for the purpose of this division, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interests or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds. This subparagraph shall not apply to loans which were made or insured prior to October 1, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The quarterly rate of the special allowance set under division (i) of this subparagraph shall not be less than 9.5 percent minus the applicable interest rate on such loans, divided by 4.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) No special allowance may be paid under this subparagraph unless the issuer of such obligations complies with subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which are financed with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations originally issued on or after October 1, 1993, the income from which is excluded from gross income under title 26, shall be the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), (E), or (F), as the case may be. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interest or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) In the case of loans made before October 1, 1992, pursuant to section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> or 1078&ndash;2 of this title for which the interest rate is determined under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title, a special allowance shall not be paid unless the rate determined for any 12-month period under subparagraph (B) of such section exceeds 12 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) In the case of loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1992, pursuant to section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> or 1078&ndash;2 of this title for which the interest rate is determined under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title, a special allowance shall not be paid unless the rate determined for any 12-month period under section 1077a(c)(4)(B) of this title exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) 11 percent in the case of a loan under section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) 10 percent in the case of a loan under section 1078&ndash;2 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) In the case of loans made or purchased directly from funds loaned or advanced pursuant to a qualified State obligation, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For the purpose of division (i) of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified State obligation&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) an obligation of the Maine Educational Loan Marketing Corporation to the Student Loan Marketing Association pursuant to an agreement entered into on January 31, 1984; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) an obligation of the South Carolina Student Loan Corporation to the South Carolina National Bank pursuant to an agreement entered into on July 30, 1986.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the case of any loan for which the applicable rate of interest is described in section <!-- PDFPage:326 -->1077a(g)(2) of this title, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;2.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Subject to paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans for which the applicable rate of interest is determined under section 1077a(h) of this title shall be computed (i) by determining the applicable bond equivalent rate of the security with a comparable maturity, as established by the Secretary, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rates on such loans from such applicable bond equivalent rate, (iii) by adding 1.0 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(f) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contractual right of holders to special allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The holder of an eligible loan shall be deemed to have a contractual right against the United States, during the life of such loan, to receive the special allowance according to the provisions of this section. The special allowance determined for any such 3-month period shall be paid promptly after the close of such period, and without administrative delay after receipt of an accurate and complete request for payment, pursuant to procedures established by regulations promulgated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Penalty for late payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If payments of the special allowances payable under this section or of interest payments under section 1078(a) of this title with respect to a loan have not been made within 30 days after the Secretary has received an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment thereof, the special allowance payable to such holder shall be increased by an amount equal to the daily interest accruing on the special allowance and interest benefits payments due the holder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such daily interest shall be computed at the daily equivalent rate of the sum of the special allowance rate computed pursuant to paragraph (2) and the interest rate applicable to the loan and shall be paid for the later of (i) the 31st day after the receipt of such request for payment from the holder, or (ii) the 31st day after the final day of the period or periods covered by such request, and shall be paid for each succeeding day until, and including, the date on which the Secretary authorizes payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For purposes of reporting to the Congress the amounts of special allowances paid under this section, amounts of special allowances paid pursuant to this paragraph shall be segregated and reported separately.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &ldquo;Eligible loan&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;eligible loan&rdquo; means a loan&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Use of average quarterly balance</h4>

If the total amount of interest and special allowance payable under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, respectively, is less than the amount the lender was authorized to charge borrowers for origination fees in that quarter, the Secretary shall deduct the excess amount from the subsequent quarters&rsquo; payments until the total amount has been deducted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of origination fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (6) of this subsection, with respect to any loan (other than loans made under sections 1078&ndash;3 and 1087&ndash;2(<em>o</em>) of this title) for which a completed note or other written evidence of the loan was sent or delivered to the borrower for signing on or after 10 days after August 13, 1981, each eligible lender under this part is authorized to charge the borrower an origination fee in an amount not to exceed 3.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan, to be deducted proportionately from each installment payment of the proceeds of the loan prior to payment to the borrower.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:327 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relation to applicable interest</h4>
