<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that there is an urgent and substantial need&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities and to minimize their potential for developmental delay;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to minimize the likelihood of institutionalization of individuals with disabilities and maximize the potential for their independently living in society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to enhance the capacity of State and local agencies and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs of historically underrepresented populations, particularly minority, low-income, inner-city, and rural populations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore the policy of the United States to provide financial assistance to States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system that provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to enhance their capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing early intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to encourage States to expand opportunities for children under 3 years of age who would be at risk of having substantial developmental delay if they did not receive early intervention services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Procedures to protect the rights of the infant or toddler whenever the parents of the infant or toddler are not known or cannot be found or the infant or toddler is a ward of the State, including the assignment of an individual (who shall not be an employee of the State lead agency, or other State agency, and who shall not be any person, or any employee of a person, providing early intervention services to the infant or toddler or any family member of the infant or toddler) to act as a surrogate for the parents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Written prior notice to the parents of the infant or toddler with a disability whenever the State agency or service provider proposes to initiate or change or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or placement of the infant or toddler with a disability, or the provision of appropriate early intervention services to the infant or toddler.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Procedures designed to ensure that the notice required by paragraph (6) fully informs the parents, in the parents&rsquo; native language, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, of all procedures available pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The right of parents to use mediation in accordance with section 1415(e) of this title, except that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Ratable reduction</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If additional funds become available for making payments under this subsection for a fiscal year, allotments that were reduced under subparagraph (A) shall be increased on the same basis they were reduced.</p>
