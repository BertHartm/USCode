<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that there is an urgent and substantial need&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities, to minimize their potential for developmental delay, and to recognize the significant brain development that occurs during a child's first 3 years of life;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:703 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to maximize the potential for individuals with disabilities to live independently in society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to enhance the capacity of State and local agencies and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs of all children, particularly minority, low-income, inner city, and rural children, and infants and toddlers in foster care.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States to provide financial assistance to States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system that provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to enhance State capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing early intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to encourage States to expand opportunities for children under 3 years of age who would be at risk of having substantial developmental delay if they did not receive early intervention services.</p>
