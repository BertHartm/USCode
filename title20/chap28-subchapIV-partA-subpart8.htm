<p class="note-body">Subpart 8 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, comprising this subpart, was originally added to Pub. L. 89&ndash;329, title IV, by Pub. L. 99&ndash;498, title IV, &sect;401(a), Oct. 17, 1986, 100 Stat. 1352, and amended by Pub. L. 100&ndash;50, June 3, 1987, 101 Stat. 335; Pub. L. 102&ndash;325, July 23, 1992, 106 Stat. 448. Subpart 8 is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 105&ndash;244, title IV, &sect;411, Oct. 7, 1998, 112 Stat. 1671, without reference to those intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of subpart 8 by Pub. L. 105&ndash;244.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1070f. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The nature of postsecondary education delivery is changing, and new technology and other related innovations can provide promising education opportunities for individuals who are currently not being served, particularly for individuals without easy access to traditional campus-based postsecondary education or for whom traditional courses are a poor match with education or training needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Individuals, including individuals seeking basic or technical skills or their first postsecondary experience, individuals with disabilities, dislocated workers, individuals making the transition from welfare-to-work, and individuals who are limited by time and place constraints can benefit from nontraditional, noncampus-based postsecondary education opportunities and appropriate support services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The need for high-quality, nontraditional, technology-based education opportunities is great, as is the need for skill competency credentials and other measures of educational progress and attainment that are valid and widely accepted, but neither need is likely to be adequately addressed by the uncoordinated efforts of agencies and institutions acting independently and without assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Partnerships, consisting of institutions of higher education, community organizations, or other public or private agencies or organizations, can coordinate and combine institutional resources&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide the needed variety of education options to students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to develop new means of ensuring accountability and quality for innovative education methods.</p>
