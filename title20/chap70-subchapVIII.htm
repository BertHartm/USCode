<p class="statutory-body">In order to fulfill the Federal responsibility to assist with the provision of educational services to federally connected children, because certain activities of the Federal Government place a financial burden on the local educational agencies serving areas where such activities are carried out, and to help such children meet challenging State standards, it is the purpose of this subchapter to provide financial assistance to local educational agencies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) experience a substantial and continuing financial burden due to the acquisition of real property by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) educate children who reside on Federal property and whose parents are employed on Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) educate children of parents who are in the military services and children who live in low-rent housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) educate heavy concentrations of children whose parents are civilian employees of the Federal Government and do not reside on Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) experience sudden and substantial increases or decreases in enrollments because of military realignments; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) need special assistance with capital expenditures for construction activities because of the enrollments of substantial numbers of children who reside on Federal lands.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the United States owns Federal property in the local educational agency, and that such property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has been acquired by the United States since 1938;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was not acquired by exchange for other Federal property in the local educational agency which the United States owned before 1939; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) had an assessed value (determined as of the time or times when so acquired) aggregating 10 percent or more of the assessed value of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) all real property in the local educational agency (similarly determined as of the time or times when such Federal property was so acquired); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) all real property in the local educational agency as assessed in the first year preceding or succeeding acquisition, whichever is greater, only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the assessment of all real property in the local educational agency is not made at the same time or times that such Federal property was so acquired and assessed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) State law requires an assessment be made of property so acquired; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that such agency is not being substantially compensated for the loss in revenue resulting from such ownership by increases in revenue accruing to the agency from the conduct of Federal activities with respect to such Federal property,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such agency shall be eligible to receive the amount described in subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The amount that a local educational agency shall be paid under subsection (a) of this section for a fiscal year shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (2), except that such amount shall be reduced by the Secretary by an amount equal to the amount of revenue, if any, that such agency received during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on such Federal property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the amount of revenue that a local educational agency receives during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property shall not include payments received by the agency from the Secretary of Defense to support&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Application of current levied real property tax rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In calculating the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall apply the current levied real property tax rate for current expenditures levied by fiscally independent local educational agencies, or imputed for fiscally dependent local educational agencies, to the current annually determined aggregate assessed value of such acquired Federal property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of aggregate assessed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such aggregate assessed value of such acquired Federal property shall be determined on the basis of the highest and best use of property adjacent to such acquired Federal property as of the time such value is determined, and provided to the Secretary, by the local official responsible for assessing the value of real property located in the jurisdiction of such local educational agency for the purpose of levying a property tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicability to Tennessee Valley Authority Act</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the United States transfers a portion of the property referred to in paragraph (1) to another nontaxable entity, and the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) restricts some or any construction on such property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) requires that the property be used in perpetuity for the public purposes for which the property was conveyed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) requires the grantee of the property to report to the Federal Government (or its agent) regarding information on the use of the property;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1188 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) except with the approval of the Federal Government (or its agent), prohibits the sale, lease, assignment, or other disposal of the property unless such sale, lease, assignment, or other disposal is to another eligible government agency; and</p>
