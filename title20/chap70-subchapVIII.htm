<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">In order to fulfill the Federal responsibility to assist with the provision of educational services to federally connected children in a manner that promotes control by local educational agencies with little or no Federal or State involvement, because certain activities of the Federal Government, such as activities to fulfill the responsibilities of the Federal Government with respect to Indian tribes and activities under section 571 of title 50, Appendix, place a financial burden on the local educational agencies serving areas where such activities are carried out, and to help such children meet challenging State standards, it is the purpose of this subchapter to provide financial assistance to local educational agencies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) experience a substantial and continuing financial burden due to the acquisition of real property by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) educate children who reside on Federal property and whose parents are employed on Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) educate children of parents who are in the military services and children who live in low-rent housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) educate heavy concentrations of children whose parents are civilian employees of the Federal Government and do not reside on Federal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) need special assistance with capital expenditures for construction activities because of the enrollments of substantial numbers of children who reside on Federal lands and because of the difficulty of raising local revenue through bond referendums for capital projects due to the inability to tax Federal property.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Computation of payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b) or (d) of this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of children who were in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding school year and who, while in attendance at such schools&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) resided on Federal property with a parent employed on Federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the school district of such agency; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) resided in low-rent housing;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if not in such county, in whole or in part in the same State as such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of weighted student units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 6,500; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 1,000 or such number equals or exceeds 10 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Military installation and Indian housing undergoing renovation or rebuilding</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of computing the amount of a payment for a local educational agency for children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i), the Secretary shall consider such children to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of Defense, that such children would have resided in housing on Federal property in ac<!-- PDFPage:1338 -->cordance with paragraph (1)(B) except that such housing was undergoing renovation or rebuilding on the date for which the Secretary determines the number of children under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of computing the amount of a payment for a local educational agency that received a payment for children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application, the Secretary shall consider such children to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that such children would have resided in housing on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) except that such housing was undergoing renovation or rebuilding on the date for which the Secretary determines the number of children under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i)(I) Children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i) may be deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to housing on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) for a period not to exceed 3 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The number of children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i) who are deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to housing on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) for any fiscal year may not exceed the maximum number of children who are expected to occupy that housing upon completion of the renovation or rebuilding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii)(I) Children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application may be deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) with respect to housing on Indian lands undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) for a period not to exceed 3 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The number of children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application who are deemed to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) with respect to housing on Indian lands undergoing renovation or rebuilding in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) for any fiscal year may not exceed the maximum number of children who are expected to occupy that housing upon completion of the renovation or rebuilding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Military &ldquo;Build to Lease&rdquo; program housing</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of computing the amount of payment for a local educational agency for children identified under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider children residing in housing initially acquired or constructed under the former section 2828(g) of title 10 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Build to Lease&rdquo; program), as added by section 801 of the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1984, to be children described under paragraph (1)(B) if the property described is within the fenced security perimeter of the military facility upon which such housing is situated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the property described in subparagraph (A) is not owned by the Federal Government, is subject to taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State, and thereby generates revenues for a local educational agency that is applying to receive a payment under this section, then the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall require the local educational agency to provide certification from an appropriate official of the Department of Defense that the property is being used to provide military housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall reduce the amount of the payment under this section by an amount equal to the amount of revenue from such taxation received in the second preceding fiscal year by such local educational agency, unless the amount of such revenue was taken into account by the State for such second preceding fiscal year and already resulted in a reduction in the amount of State aid paid to such local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basic support payments; insufficient appropriations; State with only one local educational agency</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basic support payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at least 400 such children; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as com<!-- PDFPage:1339 -->puted under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a State may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider payments under this subchapter in determining for any fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the eligibility of a local educational agency for State aid for free public education; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of such aid; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make such aid available to local educational agencies in a manner that results in less State aid to any local educational agency that is eligible for such payment than such agency would receive if such agency were not so eligible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State equalization plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may reduce State aid to a local educational agency that receives a payment under section 7702 or 7703(b) of this title (except the amount calculated in excess of 1.0 under section 7703(a)(2)(B) of this title and, with respect to a local educational agency that receives a payment under section 7703(b)(2) of this title, the amount in excess of the amount that the agency would receive if the agency were deemed to be an agency eligible to receive a payment under section 7703(b)(1) of this title and not section 7703(b)(2) of this title) for any fiscal year if the Secretary determines, and certifies under subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section, that the State has in effect a program of State aid that equalizes expenditures for free public education among local educational agencies in the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local educational agencies if, in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the <!-- PDFPage:1356 -->determination is made, the amount of per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the highest such per-pupil expenditures or revenues did not exceed the amount of such per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the lowest such expenditures or revenues by more than 25 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) take into account the extent to which a program of State aid reflects the additional cost of providing free public education in particular types of local educational agencies, such as those that are geographically isolated, or to particular types of students, such as children with disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State has substantially revised its program of State aid, the Secretary may certify such program for any fiscal year only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary determines, on the basis of projected data, that the State's program will meet the disparity standard described in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State provides an assurance to the Secretary that, if final data do not demonstrate that the State's program met such standard for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the State will pay to each affected local educational agency the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures for review of State equalization plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Written notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any State that wishes to consider payments described in subsection (b)(1) of this section in providing State aid to local educational agencies shall submit to the Secretary, not later than 120 days before the beginning of the State's fiscal year, a written notice of such State's intention to do so.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such notice shall be in the form and contain the information the Secretary requires, including evidence that the State has notified each local educational agency in the State of such State's intention to consider such payments in providing State aid.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to present views</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before making a determination under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall afford the State, and local educational agencies in the State, an opportunity to present their views.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualification procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a program of State aid qualifies under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certify the program and so notify the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) afford an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with section 7711(a) of this title, to any local educational agency adversely affected by such certification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Nonqualification procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a program of State aid does not qualify under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) so notify the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) afford an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with section 7711(a) of this title, to the State, and to any local educational agency adversely affected by such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of State aid</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State has in effect a program of State aid for free public education for any fiscal year, which is designed to equalize expenditures for free public education among the local educational agencies of that State, payments under this subchapter for any fiscal year may be taken into consideration by such State in determining the relative&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) financial resources available to local educational agencies in that State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) financial need of such agencies for the provision of free public education for children served by such agency, except that a State may consider as local resources funds received under this subchapter only in proportion to the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may not take into consideration payments under this subchapter before such State's program of State aid has been certified by the Secretary under subsection (c)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Remedies for State violations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary or any aggrieved local educational agency may, not earlier than 150 days after an adverse determination by the Secretary against a State for violation of subsections (a) or (d)(2) of this section or for failure to carry out an assurance under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, and if an administrative proceeding has not been concluded within such time, bring an action in a United States district court against such State for such violations or failure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Immunity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State shall not be immune under the 11th amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action described in paragraph (1).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1357 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The court shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.</p>
