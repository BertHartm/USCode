<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Direct payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to teacher candidates, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an amount for which teacher candidates are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).</p>

Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No exceeding cost</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial course; study abroad</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude from eligibility courses of study which are noncredit or remedial in nature (including courses in English language acquisition) which are determined by the eligible institution to be necessary to help the teacher candidate be prepared for the pursuit of a first undergraduate baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate degree or certificate or, in the case of courses in English language instruction, to be necessary to enable the teacher candidate to utilize already existing knowledge, training, or skills. Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the teacher candidate is enrolled.</p>
