<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State assurances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A local educational agency may start new schoolwide programs under this section only after the State educational agency provides written information to each local educational agency in the State that demonstrates that such State agency has established the statewide system of support and improvement required by subsections (c)(1) and (e) of section 6318 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A school that desires to initiate a schoolwide program under this section prior to the establishment of the statewide system of support and improvement required in subsections (c)(1) and (e) of section 6318 of this title shall demonstrate to the local educational agency that such school has received high quality technical assistance and support from other providers of assistance such as comprehensive technical assistance centers, regional laboratories, institutions of higher education, educational service agencies, or other local consortia.</p>
