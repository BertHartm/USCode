<p class="statutory-body">(2) During each meeting described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information on at least 4 key issues, selected by the Secretary, concerning implementation of the Carl D.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Draft regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After holding regional meetings and before publishing proposed regulations in the Federal Register, the Secretary shall prepare draft regulations under this chapter and submit regulations on at least 2 key issues to a negotiated rulemaking process.
