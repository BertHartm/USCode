<p class="statutory-body">(a) It is the purpose of this chapter to assist the States in the extension and improvement of public library services to areas and populations of the States which are without such services or to which such services are inadequate and to assist Indian tribes in planning and developing library services to meet their needs. It is the further purpose of this chapter to assist with (1) public library construction and renovation; (2) improving State and local public library services for older Americans, and for handicapped, institutionalized, and other disadvantaged individuals; (3) strengthening State library administrative agencies; (4) promoting interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing among all types of libraries; (5) strengthening major urban resource libraries; and (6) increasing the capacity of libraries to keep up with rapidly changing information technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to interfere with State and local initiative and responsibility in the conduct of library services. The administration of libraries, the selection of personnel and library books and materials, and, insofar as consistent with the purposes of this chapter, the determination of the best uses of the funds provided under this chapter shall be reserved to the States and their local subdivisions and Indian tribes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide that any funds paid to the State in accordance with a long-range program and an annual program shall be expended solely for the purposes for which funds have been authorized and appropriated and that such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures have been adopted as may be necessary to assure proper disbursement of, and account for, Federal funds paid to the State (including any such funds paid by the State to any other agency) under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide satisfactory assurance that the State agency administering the plan (A) will make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary may reasonably require to carry out his functions under this chapter and to determine the extent to which funds provided under this chapter have been effective in carrying out its purposes, including reports of evaluations made under the State plans, and (B) will keep such records and afford such access thereto as the Secretary may find necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide assurances that libraries within the State that receive funds under this chapter shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, age, gender, national origin, or handicapping condition in providing space for public meetings; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) he has made specific findings as to the compliance of such plan with requirements of this chapter and he is satisfied that adequate procedures are subscribed to therein insure that any assurances and provisions of such plan will be carried out.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, until he is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply, after appropriate notice to such State agency, he shall make no further payments to the State under this chapter or shall limit payments to programs or projects under, or parts of, the programs not affected by the failure, or shall require that payments by such State agency under this chapter shall be limited to local or other public library agencies not affected by the failure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive; but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon take new or modified findings of fact and may modify his previous action, and shall certify to the court the record of further proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part.
