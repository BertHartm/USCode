<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall notify such State agency that the State will not be regarded as eligible to participate in the program under this subpart until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply.</p>

Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
