<p class="statutory-body">If the amount appropriated to carry out this division for a fiscal year is less than $50,000,000, then the Secretary shall award grants under this division on a competitive basis to States to carry out a program described in section 1070a&ndash;21 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allotment based on allocations under section 2711</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the amount appropriated to carry out this division for a fiscal year is $50,000,000 or more, then the Secretary shall allot to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount allocated under section 2711&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1070a-25_1_target" name="1070a-25_1">1</a></sup> of this title to the local education agencies in the State,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total amount allocated under such section to all such agencies in all States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limit on use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State may use less than 25 percent or more than 50 percent of its allotment for the early intervention component of the State program, except that the Secretary may waive the 50 percent limitation if the State demonstrates that the State has another means of providing the student's financial assistance that is described in the State plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any State's allotment under subsection (b) of this section for any fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required for such fiscal year for the program of that State shall be available for reallotment from time to time, on such dates during such year as the Secretary may fix, to other States in proportion to the original allotments to such States for such year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use for such year for carrying out such programs. The total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. A State shall match, in accordance with section 1070a&ndash;22(b) of this title any reallocated funds it receives under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allotment subject to continuing compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make payments for programs only to States which continue to meet the requirements of the State plan pursuant to section 1070a&ndash;22 of this title.</p>
