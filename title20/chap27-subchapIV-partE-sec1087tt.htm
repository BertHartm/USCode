<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances. However, this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student financial aid administrator in such cases to request and use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting, processing, or delivering such supplementary information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to assets taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in accordance with subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy or an involuntary liquidation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the administrator makes adjustments in the award level of a student with a disability so as to take into consideration the additional costs such student incurs as a result of such student's disability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments for special circumstances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making an adjustment for special circumstances in accordance with subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a dependent student&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such student received a Federal Pell Grant as a dependent student in academic year 1992 1993 and the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1993 1994 is at least $500 less than the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1992  1993; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:407 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the decrease described in clause (i) is the direct result of a change in the determination of such student's need for assistance in accordance with this part that is attributable to the enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a single independent student&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such student received a Federal Pell Grant as a single independent student in academic year 1992  1993 and qualified as an independent student in accordance with section 1087vv(d) of this title for academic year 1993  1994, and the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1993  1994 is at least $500 less than the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1992  1993; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the decrease described in clause (i) is the direct result of a change in the determination of such student's need for assistance in accordance with this part that is attributable to the enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A financial aid administrator shall not make an adjustment for special circumstances pursuant to this subsection in an amount that exceeds one-half of the difference between the amount of a student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1992 1993 and the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1993 1994.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Academic year limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A financial aid administrator shall make adjustments under this subsection only for Federal Pell Grants awarded for academic years 1993 1994, 1994  1995, and 1995  1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Adjustments under this subsection shall be made in any fiscal year only if an Act that contains an appropriation for such fiscal year to carry out this subsection is enacted on or after December 20, 1993.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Adjustments under this subsection shall not be available for any academic year to any student who, on the basis of the financial circumstances of the student for the current academic year, would not have been eligible for a grant under this section in academic year 1992  1993.</p>
