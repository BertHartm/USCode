<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the method or sources of data that are used under subsection (c) of this section and section 6313(c)(1) of this title to determine the number of children from low-income families in participating school attendance areas who attend private schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) how and when the agency will make decisions about the delivery of services to such children, including a thorough consideration and analysis of the views of the private school officials on the provision of services through a contract with potential third-party providers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) how, if the agency disagrees with the views of the private school officials on the provision of services through a contract, the local educational agency will provide in writing to such private school officials an analysis of the reasons why the local educational agency has chosen not to use a contractor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such consultation shall include meetings of agency and private school officials and shall occur before the local educational agency makes any decision that affects the opportunities of eligible private school children to participate in programs under this part.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) using the same measure of low income used to count public school children;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If a local educational agency is prohibited by law from providing for the participation in pro<!-- PDFPage:1032 -->grams on an equitable basis of eligible children enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools, or if the Secretary determines that a local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling, to provide for such participation, as required by this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements that shall be subject to the requirements of this section and sections 7883 and 7884 of this title; and</p>
