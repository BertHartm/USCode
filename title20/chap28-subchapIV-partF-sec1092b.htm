<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Development of System</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall consult with a representative group of guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, and eligible institutions to develop a mutually agreeable proposal for the establishment of a National Student Loan Data System containing information regarding loans made, insured, or guaranteed under part B of this subchapter and loans made under parts C and D of this subchapter, and for allowing the electronic exchange of data between program participants and the system. In establishing such data system, the Secretary shall place a priority on providing for the monitoring of enrollment, student status, information about current loan holders and servicers, and internship and residency information. Such data system shall also permit borrowers to use the system to identify the current loan holders and servicers of such borrower's loan not later than one year after October 7, 1998. The information in the data system shall include (but is not limited to)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount and type of each such loan made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the names and social security numbers of the borrowers;</p>
