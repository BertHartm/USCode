<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for the fiscal year 1991, $260,000,000 for the fiscal year 1992, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 to carry out the provisions of this chapter (other than sections 1211 and 1211a of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From the sums available for the purposes of section 1201 of this title for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot (1) $100,000 each to Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau, and (2) $250,000 to each of the other States. From the remainder of such sums the Secretary shall allot to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as the number of adults who do not have a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education (or its equivalent) and who are not currently required to be enrolled in schools of such State bears to the number of such adults in all States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The portion of any State's allotment under subsection (b) of this section for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required for the period such allotment is available for carrying out the State plan approved under this chapter shall be available for reallotment from time to time, on such dates during such period as the Secretary shall fix, to other States in proportion to the original allotments to such States under subsection (b) of this section for such year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other State being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum which the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use for such period for carrying out its State plan approved under this chapter, and the total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts are not so reduced. Any amount allotted to a State under this subsection during a year shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (b) of this section for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reservation of funds for national programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any fiscal year, if the amount appropriated to carry out the purposes of this chapter exceeds $108,000,000, not more than $3,000,000 of such amount shall be reserved to carry out the programs described in subchapter IV of this chapter, relating to national programs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Grants to States under this part shall be used in accordance with State plans (and amendments thereto) approved under sections 1206 and 1207 of this title, to pay the Federal share of the cost of the establishment or expansion of adult education programs to be carried out by local educational agencies, correctional education agencies, community-based organizations, public or private nonprofit agencies, postsecondary educational institutions, and other institutions that have the ability to provide literacy services to adults and families. Each State educational agency receiving financial assistance under this part shall provide assurance that local educational agencies, public or private nonprofit agencies, community-based organizations, correctional education agencies, postsecondary educational institutions, and institutions which serve educationally disadvantaged adults will be provided direct and equitable access to all Federal funds provided under this part. Failure to provide the assurance required by the preceding sentence shall disqualify a State from receiving its allotment under this chapter. In determining which programs shall receive assistance under this paragraph, the State shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the past effectiveness of applicants in providing services (especially with respect to recruitment and retention of educationally disadvantaged adults and the learning gains demonstrated by such adults);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the degree to which the applicant will coordinate and utilize other literacy and social services available in the community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the commitment of the applicant to serve individuals in the community that are most in need of literacy services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Grants to States provided under this section may also be used to carry out programs by a consortium which includes a for-profit agency, organization, or institution if such agency, organization, or institution can make a significant contribution to attaining the objectives of this Act. Whenever the establishment or expansion of programs includes a for-profit agency, organization, or institution, as part of a consortium, a contract with such agency, organization, or institution, for the establishment or expansion of such programs shall be entered into by the public or private nonprofit agency, institution, or organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Grants to States provided under this section shall also be used for competitive 2-year grants to public housing authorities for literacy programs and related activities. Any public housing authority that receives a grant under this subparagraph shall consult with local adult education providers in conducting programs and activities with assistance provided under the grant. Any grant provided under this subparagraph shall be referred to as a &ldquo;Gateway Grant&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall, not less often than every 2 years, evaluate any grants made under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Such application shall contain such information as the State educational agency considers necessary, including a description of current programs, activities, and services receiving assistance from Federal, State, and local sources; the projected goals of the applicant with respect to participant recruitment, retention, and educational achievement and how the applicant will measure and report progress in meeting its goals; cooperative arrangements (including arrangements with business, industry, and volunteer literacy organizations as appropriate) that have been made to deliver services to adults as well as assurances that adult educational programs, services, or activities provided under this chapter are coordinated with and not duplicative of services, programs, or activities made available to adults under other Federal, State, and local programs, including the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.], the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act [20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.], the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.], the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.], title IX of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 7801 et seq.], the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act [42 U.S.C. 4950].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The State educational agency shall give preference to those applicants who have demonstrated or can demonstrate a capability to recruit and serve educationally disadvantaged adults, particularly in areas with a high proportion of adults who do not have a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education or its equivalent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not less than 10 percent of the funds paid to a State under subsection (a) of this section shall be used for corrections education and education for other institutionalized individuals in accordance with part B of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not more than 20 percent of a State's allotment shall be used for programs of equivalency for a certificate of graduation from a secondary school.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procedures required in formulating State plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In formulating the State plan, the State agency shall meet with and utilize the State advisory council, if established pursuant to section 1205a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The State agency shall conduct public hearings in the State, after appropriate and sufficient notice, for the purpose of affording all segments of the public, including groups serving educationally disadvantaged adults, and interested organizations and groups an opportunity to present their views and make recommendations regarding the State plan. A summary of such recommendations and the State agency's response shall be included with the State plan submitted to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Not less than 60 days before submission of the State plan to the Secretary under section 1206 of this title, the State agency shall simultaneously submit the proposed State plan to (i) the State Board or agency for vocational education, (ii) the State Job Training Coordinating Council under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.], and (iii) the State Board responsible for postsecondary education for review and comment. Such comments (to the extent such comments are received in a timely fashion) and the State's response shall be included with the State plan submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary shall consider such comments in reviewing such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not less than 60 days before the submission of the State plan to the Secretary, such plan shall be submitted to the State advisory council (if such a council exists). Should the State advisory council find that it has substantial disagreement with the final State plan, the Council may file timely objections with the State agency. The State agency shall respond to all substantial objections of the State advisory council in submitting such plan to the Secretary. The Secretary shall consider such comments in reviewing the State plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing the 4-year State plan, each State shall (1) make a thorough assessment of (A) the needs of adults, including educationally disadvantaged adults, eligible to be served as well as adults proposed to be served and those served and (B) the capability of existing programs and institutions to meet those needs, and (2) state the changes and improvements required in adult education to fulfill the purposes of this chapter, and the options for implementing these changes and improvements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) set forth measurable goals for improving literacy levels, retention in literacy programs, and long-term learning gains of individuals in the State and describe a comprehensive approach for achieving such goals, including the development of indicators of program quality as required by section 1205(a)(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) describe the curriculum, equipment, and instruments that are being used by instruction personnel and indicate how current these elements are;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) describe the means by which the delivery of adult education services will be significantly expanded (including efforts to reach typically underserved groups such as educationally disadvantaged adults, individuals with limited English proficiency and individuals with handicaps) through coordination by agencies, institutions, and organizations including the public school system, businesses, labor unions, libraries, institutions of higher education, public health authorities, employment or training programs, antipoverty programs, organizations providing assistance to the homeless, and community and voluntary organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) describe the means by which representatives of the public and private sector are involved in the development and implementation of the plan, especially in the expansion of the delivery of adult education services by cooperation and collaboration with those public and private agencies, institutions, and organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) describe specialized efforts to attract and assist meaningful participation in adult education programs through flexible course schedules, provision of auxiliary aids and services, convenient locations, adequate transportation, and meeting child care needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the needs of persons with limited English proficiency (as defined in section 7601(8)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1206a_1_target" name="1206a_1">1</a></sup> of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1206a_2_target" name="1206a_2">2</a></sup> or no English proficiency by providing adequate appropriate language assistance to the extent necessary to all such persons so they may progress effectively through adult education programs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) set forth the criteria the State agency will use in approving applications by eligible recipients and allocating funds made available under this chapter to such recipients;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) describe the methods proposed for the joint planning and coordination of programs carried out under this chapter with those conducted under applicable Federal and State programs, including the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1963 [20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.], Even Start, the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.], the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.], the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.], the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act [42 U.S.C. 4950 et seq.], to assure maximum use of funds under these Acts and to avoid duplication of services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) describe the steps taken to utilize volunteers, particularly volunteers assigned to the Literacy Corps established under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act [42 U.S.C. 4950 et seq.] and volunteers trained in programs carried out by section 1213a of this title, but only to the extent that such volunteers supplement and do not supplant salaried employees;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) renders them unemployable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) keeps them, whether employed or unemployed, from functioning independently in society; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) severely reduces their ability to have a positive effect on the literacy of their children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limited English proficiency rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Programs conducted under subsection (c)(6) of this section shall be designed to teach English to limited English proficient adults and, as appropriate, to allow such adults to progress effectively through the adult education program or to prepare them to enter the regular program of adult education as quickly as possible. Such programs may provide instruction in the native language, to the extent necessary, or may provide instruction exclusively in English, and shall be carried out in coordination with programs assisted under the Bilingual Education Act [20 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] and with bilingual vocational education programs under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act [20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection for 1 fiscal year only, upon making a determination that such waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the ability of the applicant to meet such requirements, such as a natural disaster or an unforeseen and precipitous decline in financial resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Federal responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after July 25, 1991, the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate experts, educators, and administrators, shall develop indicators of program quality that may be used by State and local programs receiving assistance under this chapter as models by which to judge the success of such programs, including success in recruitment and retention of students and improvement in the literacy skills of students.
