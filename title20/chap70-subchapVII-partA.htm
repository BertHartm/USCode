<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments taken into account by the State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not make a grant under this subpart to a local educational agency for a fiscal year if, for such fiscal year, the State in which the local educational agency is located takes into consideration payments made under this chapter&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7428_1_target" name="7428_1">1</a></sup> in determining the eligibility of the local educational agency for State aid, or the amount of the State aid, with respect to the free public education of children during such fiscal year or the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (1) for a local educational agency, for not more than 1 year at a time, if the Secretary determines that the failure to comply with such requirement is due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the agency's financial resources.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Future determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall not use the reduced amount of the agency's expenditures for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which a waiver is granted to determine compliance with paragraph (1) for any succeeding fiscal year, but shall use the amount of expenditures that would have been required to comply with paragraph (1) in the absence of the waiver.</p>
