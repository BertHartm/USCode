<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) participation in athletic pursuits plays an important role in keeping the minds and bodies of young Americans healthy and physically fit;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) there is increasing concern among citizens, educators, and public officials regarding the athletic opportunities for young men and women at institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) a recent study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association found that in Division I&ndash;A institutions, only 20 percent of the average athletic department operations budget of $1,310,000 is spent on women's athletics; 15 percent of the average recruiting budget of $318,402 is spent on recruiting female athletes; the average scholarship expenses for men is $1,300,000 and $505,246 for women; and an average of 143 grants are awarded to male athletes and 59 to women athletes;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) knowledge of an institution's expenditures for women's and men's athletic programs would help prospective students and prospective student athletes make informed judgments about the commitments of a given institution of higher education to providing equitable athletic benefits to its men and women students.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 102 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;542 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) a recent study by the National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities found that just 43 percent of students attending 4-year public colleges and universities and 54 percent of students entering private institutions graduated within 6 years of enrolling;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the academic performance of student athletes, especially student athletes receiving football and basketball scholarships, has been a source of great concern in recent years;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) more than 10,000 athletic scholarships are provided annually by institutions of higher education;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) out of 8,000 postsecondary institutions participating in Federal student aid programs, only 352 colleges and universities voluntarily provide crime statistics directly through the Uniform Crime Report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other institutions report data indirectly, through local police agencies or States, in a manner that does not permit campus statistics to be separated;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) several State legislatures have adopted or are considering legislation to require reporting of campus crime statistics and dissemination of security practices and procedures, but the bills are not uniform in their requirements and standards;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) applicants for enrollment at a college or university, and their parents, should have access to information about the crime statistics of that institution and its security policies and procedures; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) while many institutions have established crime preventive measures to increase the safety of campuses, there is a clear need&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to encourage the development on all campuses of security policies and procedures;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applicability of other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A lender offering a combined payment plan shall comply with all provisions of section 1078&ndash;3 of this title applicable to loans consolidated or to be consolidated and shall comply with all provisions of subpart I&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_1_target" name="1092a_1">1</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act applicable to loans under that subpart which are made part of the combined payment plan, except that a lender offering a combined payment plan under this section may offer consolidation loans pursuant to section 1078&ndash;3(b)(1)(A) of this title if such lender holds any outstanding loan of a borrower which is selected for inclusion in a combined payment plan.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:505 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lender eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such lender may offer a combined payment plan only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the lender holds an outstanding loan of that borrower which is selected by the borrower for incorporation into a combined payment plan pursuant to this section (including loans which are selected by the borrower for consolidation under this section); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower certifies that the borrower has sought and has been unable to obtain a combined payment plan from the holders of the outstanding loans of that borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Borrower selection of competing offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of multiple offers by lenders to administer a combined payment plan for a borrower, the borrower shall select from among them the lender to administer the combined payment plan including its loan consolidation component.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon selection of a lender to administer the combined payment plan, the lender may reissue any Health Education Assistance Loan selected by the borrower for incorporation in the combined payment plan which is not held by such lender and the proceeds of such reissued loan shall be paid by the lender to the holder or holders of the loans so selected to discharge the liability on such loans, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the lender selected to administer the combined payment plan has determined to its satisfaction, in accordance with reasonable and prudent business practices, for each loan being reissued (A) that the loan is a legal, valid, and binding obligation of the borrower; (B) that each such loan was made and serviced in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and (C) the insurance on such loan is in full force and effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the loan being reissued was not in default (as defined in section 733(e)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act) at the time the request for a combined payment plan is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notes and insurance certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each loan reissued under subsection (e) of this section shall be evidenced by a note executed by the borrower. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall insure such loan under a certificate of comprehensive insurance with no insurance limit, but any such certificate shall only be issued to an authorized holder of loans insured under subpart I&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (including the Student Loan Marketing Association). Such certificates shall provide that all loans reissued under this section shall be fully insured against loss of principal and interest. Any insurance issued with respect to loans reissued under this section shall be excluded from the limitation on maximum insurance authority set forth in section 728(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 729(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act, the reissued loan shall be made in an amount, including outstanding principal, capitalized interest, accrued unpaid interest not yet capitalized, and authorized late charges. The proceeds of each such loan will be paid by the lender to the holder of the original loan being reissued and the borrower's obligation to that holder on that loan shall be discharged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise specifically provided for under the provisions of this section, the terms of any reissued loan shall be the same as the terms of the original loan. The maximum repayment period for a loan reissued under this section shall not exceed the remainder of the period which would have been permitted on the original loan. If the lender holds more than one loan insured under subpart I&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act, the maximum repayment period for all such loans may extend to the latest date permitted for any individual loan. Any reissued loan may be consolidated with any other Health Education Assistance Loan as provided in the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], and, with the concurrence of the borrower, repayment of any such loans during any period may be made in amounts that are less than the interest that accrues on such loans during that period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Termination of borrower eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The status of an individual as an eligible combined payment plan borrower terminates upon receipt of a combined payment plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fees and premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No origination fee or insurance premium shall be charged to the borrower on any combined payment plan, and no origination fee or insurance premium shall be payable by the lender to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Commencement of repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Repayment of a combined payment plan shall commence within 60 days after the later of the date of acceptance of the lender's offer to administer a combined payment plan, the making of the consolidation loan or the reissuance of any Health Education Assistance Loans pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Preparations for Year 2000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to ensure that the processing, delivery, and administration of grant, loan, and work assistance provided under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 is not interrupted due to operational problems related to the inability of computer systems to indicate accurately dates after December 31, 1999, the Secretary of Education shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) take such actions as are necessary to ensure that all internal and external systems, hardware, and data exchange infrastructure administered by the Department that are necessary for the processing, delivery, and administration of the grant, loan, and work assistance are Year 2000 compliant by March 31, 1999, such that there will be no business interruption after December 31, 1999;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) ensure that the Robert T. Stafford Federal Student Loan Program and the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program are equal in level of priority with respect to addressing, and that resources are managed to equally provide for successful resolution of, the Year 2000 computer problem in both programs by December 31, 1999;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) work with the Department's various data exchange partners under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 to fully test all data exchange routes for Year 2000 compliance via end-to-end testing, and submit a report describing the parameters and results of such tests to the Comptroller General not later than March 31, 1999;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that the Inspector General of the Department (or an external, independent entity selected by the Inspector General) performs and publishes a risk assessment of the systems and hardware under the Department's management, that has been reviewed by an independent entity, and make such assessment publicly available not later than 60 days after October 7, 1998;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) not later than June 30, 1999, ensure that the Inspector General (or an external, independent entity selected by the Inspector General) conducts a review of the Department's Year 2000 compliance for the processing, delivery, and administration of grant, loan, and work assistance, and submits a report reflecting the results of that review to the Chairperson of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the Chairperson of the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) develop a contingency plan to ensure the programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 will continue to run uninterrupted in the event of widespread disruptions in the flow of accurate computerized data, which contingency plan shall include a prioritization of mission critical systems and strategies to allow data partners to transfer data through alternate means; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) alert Congress at the earliest possible time if mission critical deadlines will not be met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Postponement authority for Year 2000</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the purpose of this subsection to provide the Secretary with the flexibility necessary to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensure that the resources and capabilities of institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies are not overburdened by the combination of student aid processing and delivery requirements added or modified by the amendments made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 and by the changes required to ensure that the systems of the institutions, lenders and guaranty agencies are Year 2000 compliant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) avoid the disruption of grant, loan, or work assistance funds awarded to students because of Year 2000 compliance problems at a substantial number of institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to postpone</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may postpone, for a period of time described in paragraph (3), the implementation of any requirements under part B, C, D, or F of this subchapter that are added or modified by the amendments made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 related to the processing or delivery of grant, loan, and work assistance (which shall not include the determination of need for such assistance) provided under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) implementation of such requirements would require extensive changes to the existing systems of institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) postponement is necessary to avoid jeopardizing the ability of a substantial number of institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies to ensure that all of the systems of the institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies related to the processing or delivery of such assistance function successfully after December 31, 1999; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promptly publishes in the Federal Register a list of, and notifies Congress of, any provisions, the implementation of which the Secretary intends to postpone, with the reasons for such postponement.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:527 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exceptions to authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not postpone the implementation of one or more provisions described in this subsection longer than the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the period of time that the Secretary determines necessary to ensure that the processing and delivery systems of the institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1098c_1_target" name="1098c_1">1</a></sup> are capable of functioning successfully after December 31, 1999; or</p>
