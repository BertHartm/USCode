From the remainder of such sums the Secretary shall allot to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as the number of adults who do not have a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education (or its equivalent) and who are not currently required to be enrolled in schools of such State bears to the number of such adults in all States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The portion of any State's allotment under subsection (b) of this section for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required for the period such allotment is available for carrying out the State plan approved under this chapter shall be available for reallotment from time to time, on such dates during such period as the Secretary shall fix, to other States in proportion to the original allotments to such States under subsection (b) of this section for such year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other State being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum which the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use for such period for carrying out its State plan approved under this chapter, and the total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts are not so reduced. Any amount allotted to a State under this subsection during a year shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (b) of this section for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reservation of funds for national programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any fiscal year, if the amount appropriated to carry out the purposes of this chapter exceeds $108,000,000, not more than $3,000,000 of such amount shall be reserved to carry out the programs described in subchapter IV of this chapter, relating to national programs.</p>
