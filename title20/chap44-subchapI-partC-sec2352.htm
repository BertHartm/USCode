<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible institution or consortium of eligible institutions shall be allocated an amount that bears the same relationship to the portion of funds made available under section 2322(a)(1) of this title to carry out this section for any fiscal year as the sum of the number of individuals who are Federal Pell Grant recipients and recipients of assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs enrolled in programs meeting the requirements of section 2355 of this title offered by such institution or consortium in the preceding fiscal year bears to the sum of the number of such recipients enrolled in such programs within the State for such year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provide services to all postsecondary institutions participating in the consortium; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are of sufficient size, scope, and quality to be effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Funds allocated to a consortium formed to meet the requirements of this section shall be used only for purposes and programs that are mutually beneficial to all members of the consortium and shall be used only for programs authorized under this subchapter. Such funds may not be reallocated to individual members of the consortium for purposes or programs benefitting only 1 member of the consortium.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Waiver</h4>
