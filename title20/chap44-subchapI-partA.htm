Any such reallotment among other States shall occur on such dates during the same year as the Secretary shall fix, and shall be made on the basis of criteria established by regulation. No funds may be reallotted for any use other than the use for which they were appropriated. Any amount reallotted to a State under this subsection for any fiscal year shall remain available for obligation during the succeeding fiscal year and shall be deemed to be part of its allotment for the year in which it is obligated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purposes of this section, population shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the latest estimates available to the Department.</p>
