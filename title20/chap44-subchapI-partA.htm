<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Per capita determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of paragraph (1), the per capita payment for any fiscal year shall be determined by dividing the amount available for grants to tribally controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institutions under this section for such program year by the sum of the Indian student counts of such institutions for such program year.
