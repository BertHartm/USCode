The amount of such payment for any fiscal year shall be 1.25 percent of the aggregate of the amount available to all States under this part for that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Interior shall distribute the total amount of the 1.25 percent under paragraph (1) in the following manner:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:745 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For the first fiscal year, each tribe or tribal organization shall receive an amount proportionate to the amount of weighted student units for special education programs for BIA operated or funded schools serving such reservation generated under the formula established under section 2008&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1484_2_target" name="1484_2">2</a></sup> of title 25, divided by the total number of such students in all BIA operated or funded schools.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For each fiscal year thereafter, each tribe or tribal organization shall receive an amount based on the number of infants and toddlers residing on the reservation as determined annually divided by the total of such children served by all tribes or tribal organizations.</p>

Such funds may also be used to provide early intervention services in accordance with this subchapter. These activities may be carried out directly or through contracts or cooperative agreements with the BIA, local educational agencies, and other public or private nonprofit organizations. The tribe and tribal organization is encouraged to involve Indian parents in the development and implementation of these activities. The above entities shall, as appropriate, make referrals to local, State, or Federal entities for the provision of services or further diagnosis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) To be eligible to receive a grant pursuant to paragraph (2), the tribe or tribal organization shall make a biennial report to the Secretary of the Interior of activities undertaken under this subsection, including the number of contracts and cooperative agreements entered into, the number of children contacted and receiving services for each year, and the estimated number of children needing services during the 2 years following the one in which the report is made.

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) If the sums made available under this subchapter for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that all States are eligible to receive under this subsection for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce the allocations to such States for such year.</p>
