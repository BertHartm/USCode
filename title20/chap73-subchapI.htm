<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whether the activities are built on a strong foundation of research and effective educational practice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) whether the activities effectively employ advances in technology, as appropriate, including the use of computers;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1310 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) whether the activities provide learning in real life contexts to ensure that an individual has the skills needed to compete in the workplace and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) whether the activities are staffed by well-trained instructors, counselors, and administrators;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) whether the activities coordinate with other available resources in the community, such as by establishing strong links with elementary schools and secondary schools, postsecondary educational institutions, one-stop centers, job training programs, and social service agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) whether the activities offer flexible schedules and support services (such as child care and transportation) that are necessary to enable individuals, including individuals with disabilities or other special needs, to attend and complete programs;</p>
