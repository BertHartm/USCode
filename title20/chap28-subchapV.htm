<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State educational agency receiving funds reserved pursuant to section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title shall use such funds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) first, to conduct a study of teacher education programs within such State, as required under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) secondly, for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) activities directly related to the implementation of the teacher education study required under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State educational agency can demonstrate that the amount of funds reserved pursuant to section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title is insufficient to establish one State academy, then the State educational agency shall distribute such funds to local educational agencies in accordance with section 1102(b)(2)(A) or 1102(c) of this title to carry out the activities described in section 1102b(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State educational agency receiving funds under this part shall, in consultation <!-- PDFPage:452 -->with institutions of higher education, local educational agencies, teachers, parents, the State legislature, the State board of education, and business, undertake a study of&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to determine if such programs and requirements are adequately preparing teachers to effectively educate students.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such study shall consider whether such programs or requirements&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) would be improved if teacher education programs were required to coordinate courses with other departments on campus in order to provide prospective teachers with a strong background in their subject matter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) integrate academic and vocational education instruction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) give enough flexibility in order to allow experimentation and innovation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) would be improved if such programs provided preparation for students desiring to become teachers, but who are pursuing a bachelor's degree in an area of study other than education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) would be improved if teacher certification required a bachelor's degree in a subject area and a master's degree in education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) would be improved if institutions of higher education that have developed innovative materials and curricula for inservice training were required to incorporate these improvements into their preservice programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deadlines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Such study shall be completed by two years from the end of the first fiscal year in which funding was made available for this part.
