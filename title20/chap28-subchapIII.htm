<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are a significant number of institutions of higher education serving high percentages of minority students and students from low-income backgrounds, that face problems that threaten their ability to survive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the problems relate to the management and fiscal operations of certain institutions of higher education, as well as to an inability to engage in long-range planning and development activities, including endowment building;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in order to be competitive and provide a high-quality education for all, institutions of higher education should improve their technological capacity and make effective use of technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the subchapter III program prior to 1985 did not always meet the specific development needs of historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions with large concentrations of minority, low-income students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the solution of the problems of these institutions would enable them to become viable, fiscally stable and independent, thriving institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) providing assistance to eligible institutions will enhance the role of such institutions in providing access and quality education to low-income and minority students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) these institutions play an important role in the American system of higher education, and there is a strong national interest in assisting them in solving their problems and in stabilizing their management and fiscal operations, and in becoming financially independent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) there is a particular national interest in aiding those institutions of higher education that have historically served students who have been denied access to postsecondary education because of race or national origin and whose participation in the American system of higher education is in the Nation's interest so that equality of access and quality of post<!-- PDFPage:217 -->secondary education opportunities may be enhanced for all students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to assist such institutions in equalizing educational opportunity through a program of Federal assistance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the historically Black colleges and universities have contributed significantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity through postsecondary education for Black, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged Americans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) States and the Federal Government have discriminated in the allocation of land and financial resources to support Black public institutions under the Morrill Act of 1862 [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and its progeny, and against public and private Black colleges and universities in the award of Federal grants and contracts, and the distribution of Federal resources under this chapter and other Federal programs which benefit institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the current state of Black colleges and universities is partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action requires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary institutions to ensure their continuation and participation in fulfilling the Federal mission of equality of educational opportunity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) financial assistance to establish or strengthen the physical plants, financial man<!-- PDFPage:225 -->agement, academic resources, and endowments of the historically Black colleges and universities are appropriate methods to enhance these institutions and facilitate a decrease in reliance on governmental financial support and to encourage reliance on endowments and private sources.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repayment provisions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) give priority to an applicant with a greater need for such a grant, based on the current market value of the applicant's existing endowment in relation to the number of full-time equivalent students enrolled at such institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the effort made by the applicant to build or maintain its existing endowment fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the degree to which an applicant proposes to match the grant with nongovernmental funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any institution which is eligible for assistance under this section may submit to the Secretary a grant application at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe, including a description of the long- and short-term plans for raising and using the funds under this part. Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this section and consistent with the requirement of subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary may approve an application for a grant if an institution, in its application, provides adequate assurances that it will comply with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Termination and recovery provisions</h4>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in section 1066c of this title, the Secretary is authorized to enter into insurance agreements to provide financial insurance to guarantee the full payment of principal and interest on qualified bonds upon the conditions set forth in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Responsibilities of designated bonding authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not enter into an insurance agreement described in subsection (a) of this section unless the Secretary designates a qualified bonding authority in accordance with sections 1066d(1) and 1066e&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1066b_1_target" name="1066b_1">1</a></sup> of this title and the designated bonding authority agrees in such agreement to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use the proceeds of the qualified bonds, less costs of issuance not to exceed 2 percent of the principal amount thereof, to make loans to eligible institutions or for deposit into an escrow account for repayment of the bonds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that not less than 95 percent of the proceeds of the loan will be used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to finance the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, construction or acquisition, of a capital project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refinance an obligation the proceeds of which were used to finance the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, construction or acquisition, of a capital project;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) charge such interest on loans, and provide for such a schedule of repayments of loans, as will, upon the timely repayment of the loans, provide adequate and timely funds for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require that any payment on a loan expected to be necessary to make a payment of principal and interest on the bonds be due not less than 60 days prior to the date of the payment on the bonds for which such loan payment is expected to be needed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) prior to the making of any loan, provide for a credit review of the institution receiving the loan and assure the Secretary that, on the basis of such credit review, it is reasonable to anticipate that the institution receiving the loan will be able to repay the loan in a timely manner pursuant to the terms thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that, if a delinquency on such loan results in a funding under the insurance agreement, the institution obligated on such loan shall repay the Secretary, upon terms to be determined by the Secretary, for such funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) assign any loans to the Secretary, upon the demand of the Secretary, if a delinquency on such loan has required a funding under the insurance agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in the event of a delinquency on a loan, engage in such collection efforts as the Secretary shall require for a period of not less than 45 days prior to requesting a funding under the insurance agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) establish an escrow account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) into which each eligible institution shall deposit 5 percent of the proceeds of any loan made under this part, with each eligible institution required to maintain in the escrow account an amount equal to 5 percent of the outstanding principal of all loans made to such institution under this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the balance of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be available to the Secretary to pay principal and interest on the bonds in the event of delinquency in loan repayment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be used to return to an eligible institution an amount equal to any remaining portion of such institution's 5 percent deposit of loan proceeds following scheduled repayment of such institution's loan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that, if a delinquency on such loan results in amounts being withdrawn from the escrow account to pay principal and interest on bonds, subsequent payments on such loan shall be available to replenish such escrow account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) comply with the limitations set forth in section 1066c of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) make loans only to eligible institutions under this part in accordance with conditions prescribed by the Secretary to ensure that loans are fairly allocated among as many eligible institutions as possible, consistent with making loans of amounts that will permit capital projects of sufficient size and scope to significantly contribute to the educational program of the eligible institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional agreement provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any insurance agreement described in subsection (a) of this section shall provide as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The payment of principal and interest on bonds shall be insured by the Secretary until <!-- PDFPage:239 -->such time as such bonds have been retired or canceled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal liability for delinquencies and default for bonds guaranteed under this part shall only become effective upon the exhaustion of all the funds held in the escrow account described in subsection (b)(8) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary shall create a letter of credit authorizing the Department of the Treasury to disburse funds to the designated bonding authority or its assignee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The letter of credit shall be drawn upon in the amount determined by paragraph (5) of this subsection upon the certification of the designated bonding authority to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee that there is a delinquency on 1 or more loans and there are insufficient funds available from loan repayments and the escrow account to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest on the bonds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Upon receipt by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee of the certification described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the designated bonding authority may draw a funding under the letter of credit in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount required to make the next scheduled payment of principal and interest on the bonds, less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount available to the designated bonding authority from loan repayments and the escrow account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) All funds provided under the letter of credit shall be paid to the designated bonding authority within 2 business days following receipt of the certification described in paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Full faith and credit provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (c)(1) of this section the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all funds which may be required to be paid under the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Sale of bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a qualified bond guaranteed under this part may be sold to any party that offers terms that the Secretary determines are in the best interest of the eligible institution.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is incumbent on the Federal Government to support the technological and economic competitiveness of the United States by improving and expanding the scientific and technological capacity of the United States. More and better prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts are needed to improve and expand such capacity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) As the Nation's population becomes more diverse, it is important that the educational and training needs of all Americans are met. Underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields diminishes our Nation's competitiveness by impairing the quantity of well prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts in these fields.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, minority institutions provide an important educational opportunity for minority students, particularly in science and engineering fields. Aid to minority institutions is a good way to address the underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) There is a strong Federal interest in improving science and engineering programs at minority institutions as such programs lag behind in program offerings and in student enrollment compared to such programs at other institutions of higher education.</p>
