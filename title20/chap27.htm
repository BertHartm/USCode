<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are a significant number of institutions of higher education serving high percentages of minority students and students from low-income backgrounds, that face problems that threaten their ability to survive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the problems relate to the management and fiscal operations of certain institutions of higher education, as well as to an inability to engage in long-range planning and development activities, including endowment building;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the subchapter III program prior to 1985 did not always meet the specific development needs of historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions with large concentrations of minority, low-income students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the solution of the problems of these institutions would enable them to become viable, fiscally stable and independent, thriving institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing assistance to eligible institutions will enhance the role of such institutions in providing access and quality education to low-income and minority students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) these institutions play an important role in the American system of higher education, and there is a strong national interest in assisting them in solving their problems and in stabilizing their management and fiscal operations, and in becoming financially independent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) there is a particular national interest in aiding those institutions of higher education that have historically served students who have been denied access to postsecondary education because of race or national origin and whose participation in the American system of higher education is in the Nation's interest so that equality of access and quality of postsecondary education opportunities may be enhanced for all students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the historically Black colleges and universities have contributed significantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity through postsecondary education for Black, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged Americans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) States and the Federal Government have discriminated in the allocation of land and financial resources to support Black public institutions under the Morrill Act of 1862 [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and its progeny, and against public and private Black colleges and universities in the award of Federal grants and contracts, and the distribution of Federal resources under this chapter and other Federal programs which benefit institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the current state of Black colleges and universities is partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action requires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary institutions to ensure their continuation and participation in fulfilling the Federal mission of equality of educational opportunity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) financial assistance to establish or strengthen the physical plants, financial management, academic resources, and endowments of the historically Black colleges and universities are appropriate methods to enhance these institutions and facilitate a decrease in reliance on governmental financial support and to encourage reliance on endowments and private sources.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program authority and method of distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, during the period beginning July 1, 1972, and ending September 30, 1998, pay to each eligible institution such sums as may be necessary to pay to each eligible student (defined in accordance with section 1091 of this title) for each academic year during which that student is in attendance at an institution of higher education, as an undergraduate, a basic grant in the amount for which that student is eligible, as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Not less than 85 percent of such sums shall be advanced to eligible institutions prior to the start of each payment period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the institution as needed to pay eligible students, except that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to place an institution on a reimbursement system of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to students, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an amount for which they are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Basic grants made under this subpart shall be known as &ldquo;Federal Pell Grants&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose and amount of grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of this subpart is to provide a basic grant that in combination with reasonable family and student contribution and supplemented by the programs authorized under subparts 3 and 4 of this part, will meet at least 75 percent of a student's cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title), unless the institution determines that a greater amount of assistance would better serve the purposes of section 1070<sup><a href="#1070a_1_target" name="1070a_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the basic grant for a student eligible under this part shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $3,700 for academic year 1993 1994,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $3,900 for academic year 1994  1995,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) $4,100 for academic year 1995 1996,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) $4,300 for academic year 1996  1997, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) $4,500 for academic year 1997 1998,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the expected family contribution with respect to that student for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where a student attends an institution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (including a student who attends an institution of higher education on less than a half-time basis) during any academic year, the amount of the basic grant to which that student is entitled shall be reduced in proportion to the degree to which that student is not so attending on a full-time basis, in accordance with a schedule of reductions established by the Secretary for the purposes of this division, computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For any academic year for which an appropriation Act provides a maximum basic grant in an amount in excess of $2,400, the amount of a student's basic grant shall equal $2,400 plus&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) one-half of the amount by which such maximum basic grant exceeds $2,400; plus</p>
<!-- PDFPage:242 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the remaining one-half of such excess; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the sum of the student's tuition and the student's allowance determined under subparagraph (B), if applicable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), a student's allowance is $750 if the student has dependent care expenses (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em>(8) of this title) or disability related expenses (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em>(9) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No basic grant under this subpart shall exceed the difference between the expected family contribution for a student and the cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title) at the institution at which that student is in attendance. If, with respect to any student, it is determined that the amount of a basic grant plus the amount of the expected family contribution for that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year, the amount of the basic grant shall be reduced until the combination of expected family contribution and the amount of the basic grant does not exceed the cost of attendance at such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No basic grant shall be awarded to a student under this subpart if the amount of that grant for that student as determined under this subsection for any academic year is less than $400, except that a student who is eligible for a basic grant that is equal to or greater than $200 but less than $400 shall be awarded a basic grant of $400.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive 2 Pell grants during a single award year, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the student is enrolled full-time in an associate or baccalaureate degree program of study that is 2 years or longer at an eligible institution that is computed in credit hours; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the student completes course work toward completion of an associate or baccalaureate degree that exceeds the requirements for a full academic year as defined by the institution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the Secretary shall allow the amount of the basic grant to be exceeded for students participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the institution at which the student is enrolled when the reasonable costs of such program are greater than the cost of attendance at the student's home institution, except that the amount of such basic grant in any fiscal year shall not exceed the grant level specified in the appropriate Appropriation Act for this subpart for such year. If the preceding sentence applies, the financial aid administrator at the home institution may use the cost of the study abroad program, rather than the home institution's cost, to determine the cost of attendance of the student.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) No basic grant shall be awarded under this subpart to any individual who is incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period of eligibility for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The period during which a student may receive basic grants shall be the period required for the completion of the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study being pursued by that student at the institution at which the student is in attendance except that any period during which the student is enrolled in a noncredit or remedial course of study as defined in paragraph (2) shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility courses of study which are noncredit or remedial in nature (including courses in English language instruction) which are determined by the institution to be necessary to help the student be prepared for the pursuit of a first undergraduate baccalaureate degree or certificate or, in the case of courses in English language instruction, to be necessary to enable the student to utilize already existing knowledge, training, or skills. Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the student is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No student is entitled to receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one institution or from the Secretary and an institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applications for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall from time to time set dates by which students shall file applications for basic grants under this subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each student desiring a basic grant for any year shall file an application therefor containing such information and assurances as the Secretary may deem necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out the functions and responsibilities of this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distribution of grants to students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments under this section shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary for such purpose, in such manner as will best accomplish the purpose of this section. Any disbursement allowed to be made by crediting the student's account shall be limited to tuition and fees and, in the case of institutionally owned housing, room and board. The student may elect to have the institution provide other such goods and services by crediting the student's account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Calculation of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart (including a central processor, if any, designated by the Secretary) shall, in a timely manner, furnish to the student financial aid administrator (at each institution of higher education which a student awarded a basic grant under this subpart is attending), as a part of its regular output document, the expected family contribution for each such student. Each such student financial aid administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) examine and assess the data used to calculate the expected family contribution of the student furnished pursuant to this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recalculate the expected family contribution of the student if there has been a change in circumstances of the student or in the data submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make the award to the student in the correct amount; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:243 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) after making such award report the corrected data to such contractor and to a central processor (if any) designated by the Secretary for a confirmation of the correct computation of amount of the expected family contribution for each such student.</p>

The minimum grant level (A) for programs authorized under section 1070a 14 or 1070a 17 of this title, shall not be less than $170,000 for fiscal year 1993; (B) for programs authorized under section 1070a 12 or 1070a 16 of this title shall not be less than $180,000 for fiscal year 1994; and (C) for programs authorized under section 1070a  13 or 1070a 15 of this title shall not be less than $190,000 for fiscal year 1995.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this subpart in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) compute 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) multiply the number of eligible dependent students in each income category by 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C), minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) for each income category of dependent students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) multiply the number of eligible independent students in each income category by 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C), minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (F) for each income category of independent students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) add the amounts determined under subparagraphs (E) and (G).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;average cost of attendance&rdquo; means the average of the attendance costs for undergraduate students, which shall include (i) tuition and fees determined in accordance with subparagraph (B), (ii) standard living expenses determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), and (iii) books and supplies determined in accordance with subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The average undergraduate tuition and fees described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be computed on the basis of information reported by the institution to the Secretary, which shall include (i) total revenue received by the institution from undergraduate tuition and fees for the second year preceding the year for which it is applying for an allocation, and (ii) the institution's enrollment for such second preceding year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The standard living expense described in subparagraph (A)(ii) is equal to 150 percent of the difference between the income protection allowance for a family of five with one in college and the income protection allowance for a family of six with one in college for a single independent student.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The allowance for books and supplies described in subparagraph (A)(iii) is equal to $450.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reallocation of excess allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an institution returns to the Secretary any portion of the sums allocated to such institution under this section for any fiscal year the Secretary shall, in accordance with regulations, reallocate such excess to other institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If under paragraph (1) of this subsection an institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation, the institution's allocation for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount returned. The Secretary may waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that enforcing this paragraph would be contrary to the interest of the program.</p>

The total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount reallotted to a State under this part during a year from funds appropriated pursuant to section 1070c(b)(1) of this title shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Submission and contents of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State which desires to obtain a payment under this subpart for any fiscal year shall submit annually an application therefor through the State agency administering its program under this subpart as of July 1, 1985, unless the Governor of that State so designates, in writing, a different agency to administer the program. The application shall contain such information as may be required by, or pursuant to, regulation for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to make the determinations required under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of Federal share of grants made by qualified program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From a State's allotment under this subpart for any fiscal year the Secretary is authorized to make payments to such State for paying up to 50 percent of the amount of student grants pursuant to a State program which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is administered by a single State agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides that such grants will be in amounts not in excess of $5,000 per academic year (A) for attendance on a full-time basis at an institution of higher education, and (B) for campus-based community service work learning study jobs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provides that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) grants for such jobs be made in accordance with the provisions of section 2753(b)(1) of title 42;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provides for the selection of recipients of such grants or of such State work-study jobs on the basis of substantial financial need determined annually on the basis of criteria established by the State and approved by the Secretary, except that for the purpose of collecting data to make such determination of financial need, no student or parent shall be charged a fee that is payable to an entity other than such State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provides that, effective with respect to any academic year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, all nonprofit institutions of higher education in the State are eligible to participate in the State program, except in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of the constitution of the State or in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of a statute of the State which was enacted prior to October 1, 1978;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provides for the payment of the non-Federal portion of such grants or of such work-study jobs from funds supplied by such State which represent an additional expenditure for such year by such State for grants or work-study jobs for students attending institutions of higher education over the amount expended by such State for such grants or work-study jobs, if any, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such State initially received funds under this subpart;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provides that if the State's allocation under this subpart is based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students who are independent students or attending the institution less than full time, a reasonable proportion of the State's allocation shall be made available to such students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) provides for State expenditures under such program of an amount not less than the average annual aggregate expenditures for the preceding three fiscal years or the average annual expenditure per full-time equivalent student for such years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provides (A) for such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure proper disbursement of and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State agency under this subpart, and (B) for the making of such reports, in such form and containing such information, as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform his functions under this subpart; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) for any academic year beginning after June 30, 1987, provides the non-Federal share of the amount of student grants or work-study jobs under this subpart through a direct appropriation of State funds for the program under this subpart.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon his approval of any application for a payment under this subpart, the Secretary shall reserve from the applicable allotment (including any applicable reallotment) available therefor, the amount of such payment, which (subject to the limits of such allotment or reallotment) shall be equal to the Federal share of the cost of the students&rsquo; incentive grants or work-study jobs covered by such application. The Secretary shall pay such reserved amount, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may amend the reservation of any amount under this section, either upon approval of an amendment of the application or upon revision of the estimated cost of the student grants or work-study jobs with respect to which such reservation was made. If the Secretary approves an upward revision of such estimated cost, the Secretary may reserve the Federal share of the added cost only from the applicable allotment (or reallotment) available at the time of such approval.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose of and authority for advances to reserve funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose; eligible recipients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From sums appropriated pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4)(A) of section 1071(b) of this title, the Secretary is authorized to make advances to any State with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title for the purpose of helping to establish or strengthen the reserve fund of the student loan insurance program covered by that agreement. If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title, and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title in order to enable students in the State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such an agreement. The Secretary may make advances under this subsection both to a State program (with which he has such an agreement) and to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations (with which he has such an agreement) in that State if he determines that such advances are necessary in order that students in each eligible institution have access through such institution to a student loan insurance program which meets the requirements of section 1078(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Matching requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No advance shall be made after June 30, 1968, unless matched by an equal amount from non-Federal sources. Such equal amount may include the unencumbered non-Federal portion of a reserve fund. As used in the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;unencumbered non-Federal <!-- PDFPage:278 -->portion&rdquo; means the amount (determined as of the time immediately preceding the making of the advance) of the reserve fund less the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) advances made under this section prior to July 1, 1968;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an amount equal to twice the amount of advances made under this section after June 30, 1968, and before the advance for purposes of which the determination is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proceeds of earnings on advances made under this section; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount which is required to be maintained in such fund pursuant to State law or regulation, or by agreement with lenders, as a reserve against the insurance of outstanding loans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Except as provided in section 1078(c)(10)(E)<sup><a href="#1072_1_target" name="1072_1">1</a></sup> or (F) of this title, such unencumbered non-Federal portion shall not be subject to recall, repayment, or recovery by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms and conditions; repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Advances pursuant to this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions (including conditions relating to the time or times of payment) consistent with the requirements of section 1078(b) of this title as the Secretary determines will best carry out the purpose of this section. Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate in each case in the light of the maturity and solvency of the reserve fund for which the advance was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on total advances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total of the advances from the sums appropriated pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of section 1071(b) of this title to nonprofit private institutions and organizations for the benefit of students in any State and to such State may not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of such State aged 18 to 22, inclusive, bears to the population of all the States aged 18 to 22 inclusive, but such advances may otherwise be in such amounts as the Secretary determines will best achieve the purposes for which they are made. The amount available for advances to any State shall not be less than $25,000 and any additional funds needed to meet this requirement shall be derived by proportionately reducing (but not below $25,000) the amount available for advances to each of the remaining States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculation of population</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of this subsection, the population aged 18 to 22, inclusive, of each State and of all the States shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available to him.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Advances for insurance obligations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use for payment of insurance obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From sums appropriated pursuant to section 1071(b)(4)(B) of this title, the Secretary shall advance to each State which has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1078(c) of this title with respect to a student loan insurance program, an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection to be used for the purpose of making payments under the State's insurance obligations under such program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount to be advanced to each such State shall be equal to 10 percent of the principal amount of loans made by lenders and insured by such agency on those loans on which the first payment of principal became due during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the advance is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount of any advance determined according to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be reduced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount of any advance or advances made to such State pursuant to this subsection at an earlier date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount of the unspent balance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and the preceding sentence of this subparagraph, but subject to subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, the amount of any advance to a State described in paragraph (5)(A) for the first year of its eligibility under such paragraph, and the amount of any advance to any State described in paragraph (5)(B) for each year of its eligibility under such paragraph, shall not be less than $50,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For the purpose of subparagraph (B), the unspent balance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be that portion of the balance of the State's reserve fund (remaining at the time of the State's first request for an advance pursuant to this subsection) which bears the same ratio to such balance as the Federal advances made and not returned by such State, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, bears to the total of all past contributions to such reserve funds from all sources (other than interest on investment of any portion of the reserve fund) contributed since the date such State executed an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for paying the amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) are not sufficient to pay such amounts in full, then such amounts shall be reduced&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by ratably reducing that portion of the amount allocated to each State which exceeds $50,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if further reduction is required, by equally reducing the $50,000 minimum allocation of each State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If additional sums become available for paying such amounts for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence has been applied, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:279 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of earnings for insurance obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings, if any, on any investments of advances received pursuant to this subsection must be used for making payments under the State's insurance obligations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Repayment of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall, subject to subsection (d) of this section, be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate and shall be deposited in the fund established by section 1081 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on number of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), advances pursuant to this subsection shall be made to a State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a State which is actively carrying on a program under an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title which was entered into before October 12, 1976, upon such date as such State may request, but not before October 1, 1977, and on the same day of each of the 2 succeeding calendar years after the date so requested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a State which enters into an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title on or after October 12, 1976, or which is not actively carrying on a program under an agreement pursuant to such section on such date, upon such date as such State may request, but not before October 1, 1977, and on the same day of each of the 4 succeeding calendar years after the date so requested of the advance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Payment of advances where no State program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title, and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances pursuant to this subsection for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which he has made an agreement pursuant to subsection (c), as well as subsection (b), of section 1078 of this title and subparagraph (B) of this paragraph in order to enable students in that State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such agreements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a private nonprofit institution or organization for the purpose of this paragraph under which such institution or organization&mdash;</p>

However, the Secretary may not require the return of all reserve funds of a guaranty agency to the Secretary unless the Secretary determines that such return is in the best interest of the operation of the program authorized by this part or the program authorized by part C of this subchapter, or to ensure the proper maintenance of such agency's funds or assets or the orderly termination of the guaranty agency's operations and the liquidation of its assets. The reserves shall be maintained by each guaranty agency to pay program expenses and contingent liabilities, as authorized by the Secretary, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary may direct a guaranty agency to return to the Secretary a portion of its reserve fund which the Secretary determines is unnecessary to pay the program expenses and contingent liabilities of the guaranty agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Secretary may direct a guaranty agency, or such agency's officers or directors, to cease any activities involving expenditure, use or transfer of the guaranty agency's reserve funds or assets which the Secretary determines is a misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure of such funds or assets; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any such determination under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be based on standards prescribed by regulations that are developed through negotiated rulemaking and that include procedures for administrative due process.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination provisions in contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To ensure that the funds and assets of the guaranty agency are preserved, any contract with respect to the administration of a guaranty agency's reserve funds, or the administration of any assets purchased or acquired with the reserve funds of the guaranty agency, that is entered into or extended by the guaranty agency, or any other party on behalf of or with the concurrence of the guaranty agency, after August 10, 1993, shall provide that the contract is terminable by the Secretary upon 30 days notice to the contracting parties if the Secretary determines that such contract includes an impermissible transfer of the reserve funds or assets, or is otherwise inconsistent with the terms or purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary may direct a guaranty agency to suspend or cease activities under any contract entered into by or on behalf of such agency after January 1, 1993, if the Secretary determines that the misuse or improper expenditure of such guaranty agency's funds or assets or such contract provides unnecessary or improper benefits to such agency's officers or directors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Violation of any direction issued by the Secretary under this subsection may be subject to <!-- PDFPage:281 -->the penalties described in section 1097 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In connection with the conversion specified in subparagraph (A) for any period prior to such conversion, and subject to paragraphs (C) and (D), a lender or holder shall convert the interest rate to a variable rate on a loan that is made pursuant to this part and is subject to the provisions of this subsection to a variable rate. The interest rates for such period shall be reset on a quarterly basis and the applicable interest rate for any quarter or portion thereof shall equal the sum of (i) the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-Treasury bills auctioned for the preceding 3-month period, and (ii) 3.25 percent in the case of loans described in paragraph (1) or 3.10 percent in the case of loans described in paragraph (3).

The notice shall advise the borrower that such rate shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph and shall provide the borrower with a substantially equivalent benefit as the adjustment otherwise provided for under this subsection. Such notice may be incorporated into the disclosure required under section 1083(b) of this title if such disclosure has not been previously made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The interest rate on a loan converted to a variable rate pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum interest rate applicable to the loan prior to such conversion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Loans on which the interest rate is converted in accordance with subparagraph (A) or (B) shall not be subject to any other provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Lesser rates permitted</h4>

Unless the consolidated loan is obtained by a borrower who is electing to obtain variable interest under paragraph (2) or (3), such consolidated loan shall bear interest at the weighted average of the rates of all included loans.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A borrower who has applied to an original lender for reissuance of a loan under paragraph (2) and who is denied such reissuance may obtain a loan from another lender for the purpose of discharging the loan from such original lender.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Other repayment incentives</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sale of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each guaranty agency shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary which shall provide that upon securing consecutive payments for 12 months of amounts owed on a loan for which the Secretary has made a payment under paragraph (1) of section 1078(c) of this title, the guaranty agency (pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary) or the Secretary shall, if practicable, sell the loan to an eligible lender. Such loan shall not be sold to an eligible lender who has been found by the guaranty agency or the Secretary to have substantially failed to exercise the due diligence required of lenders under this part. Neither the guaranty agency nor the Secretary shall demand from a borrower as monthly payment amounts referred to in this paragraph more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An agreement between the guaranty agency and the Secretary for purposes of this paragraph shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the repayment by the agency to the Secretary of 81.5 percent of the amount of the principal balance outstanding at the time of such sale, multiplied by the reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the guaranty agreement was made with respect to the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for the reinstatement by the Secretary (I) of the obligation to reimburse such agency for the amount expended by it in discharge of its insurance obligation under its loan insurance program, and (II) of the obligation to pay to the holder of such loan a special allowance pursuant to section 1087 1 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A loan which does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) may also be eligible for sale under this paragraph upon a determination that the loan was in default due to clerical or data processing error and would not, in the absence of such error, be in a delinquent status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of proceeds of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts received by the Secretary pursuant to the sale of such loans by a guaranty agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be deducted from the calculations of the amount of reimbursement for which the agency is eligible under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection for the fiscal year in which the amount was received, notwithstanding the fact that the default occurred in a prior fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Borrower eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any borrower whose loan is sold under paragraph (1) shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional loans or grants under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (for which he or she is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such loan sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability of general loan conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan which is sold under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, so long as the borrower continues to make scheduled repayments thereon, be subject to the same terms and conditions and qualify for the same benefits and privileges as other loans made under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each guaranty agency shall establish a program which allows a borrower with a defaulted loan or loans to renew eligibility for all title IV student financial assistance (regardless of whether the defaulted loan has been sold to an eligible lender) upon the borrower's payment of 6 consecutive monthly payments. The guaranty agency shall not demand from a borrower as a monthly payment amount under this subsection more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. A borrower may only obtain the benefit of this subsection with respect to renewed eligibility once.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of amount of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) of this section shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility <!-- PDFPage:325 -->of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loan limits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) $5,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such student is enrolled in a program of undergraduate education, the remainder of which is less than one academic year, the maximum annual loan amount that such student may receive may not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount specified in subclause (I) as such remainder measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours bears to one academic year;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of such a student who is a graduate or professional student attending an eligible institution, $10,000.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of principal and interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commencement of repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Repayment of principal on loans made under this section shall begin at the beginning of the repayment period described in section 1078(b)(7) of this title.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Capitalization of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest on loans made under this section for which payments of principal are not required during the in-school and grace periods or for which payments are deferred under sections 1077(a)(2)(C) and 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title shall, if agreed upon by the borrower and the lender (A) be paid monthly or quarterly, or (B) be added to the principal amount of the loan not more frequently than quarterly by the lender. Such capitalization of interest shall not be deemed to exceed the annual insurable limit on account of the student.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the periodic payment and the repayment schedule for any loan made pursuant to this section shall be established by assuming an interest rate equal to the applicable rate of interest at the time the repayment of the principal amount of the loan commences. At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of calculating the 10-year repayment period under section 1078(b)(1)(D) of this title, such period shall commence at the time the first payment of principal is due from the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Origination fee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of origination fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lender shall charge the borrower an origination fee in the amount of 3.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan, to be deducted proportionately from each installment payment of the proceeds of the loan prior to payment to the borrower.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of origination fee to offset default costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each lender making loans under this section shall transmit all origination fees authorized to be collected from borrowers to the Secretary, who shall use such fees to pay the Federal costs of default claims paid for loans under this section and to reduce the cost of special allowances paid thereon, if any, under section 1087  1(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of origination fee and insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In fiscal year 1995, the Secretary is directed to analyze the risk rates of borrowers who have participated in this program in the 2 previous fiscal years. If the Secretary finds, that as a result of this review, the projected defaults and special allowance costs of the unsubsidized program do not exceed the combined origination fee under this subsection and the insurance premium under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary is directed to lower the origination fee and insurance premium accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Single application form and loan repayment schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A guaranty agency shall use a single application form and a single repayment schedule for subsidized Federal Stafford loans made pursuant to section 1078 of this title and for unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans made pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State or nonprofit private institution or organization having an agreement with the Secretary under section 1078(b)(1) of this title may charge a borrower under this section an insurance premium equal to not more than 1.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan, if such premium will not be used for incentive payments to lenders.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loan-by-loan insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to issue certificates on application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, upon application by an eligible lender, made upon such form, containing such information, and supported by such evidence as the Secretary may require, and otherwise in conformity with this section, the Secretary finds that the applicant has made a loan to an eligible student which is insurable under the provisions of this part, he may issue to the applicant a certificate of insurance covering the loan and setting forth the amount and terms of the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effectiveness of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall become effective upon the date of issuance of the certificate, except that the Secretary is authorized, in accordance with regulations, to issue commitments with respect to proposed loans, or with respect to lines (or proposed lines) of credit, submitted by eligible lenders, and in that event, upon compliance with subsection (a)(1) of this section by the lender, the certificate of insurance may be issued effective as of the date when any loan, or any payment by the lender pursuant to a line of credit, to be covered by such insurance was made. Such insurance shall cease to be effective upon 60 days&rsquo; default by the lender in the payment of any installment of the premiums payable pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contents of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An application submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall contain (A) an agreement by the applicant to pay, in accordance with regulations, the premiums fixed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and (B) an agreement by the applicant that if the loan is covered by insurance the applicant will submit such supplementary reports and statement during the effective period of the loan agreement, upon such forms, at such times, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe by or pursuant to regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Comprehensive insurance coverage certificate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of system by regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of requiring a separate insurance application and issuing a separate certificate of insurance for each student loan made by an eligible lender as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations consistent with section 1074 of this title, issue to any eligible lender applying therefor a certificate of comprehensive in<!-- PDFPage:332 -->surance coverage which shall, without further action by the Secretary, insure all insurable loans made by that lender, on or after the date of the certificate and before a specified cutoff date, within the limits of an aggregate maximum amount stated in the certificate. Such regulations may provide for conditioning such insurance, with respect to any loan, upon compliance by the lender with such requirements (to be stated or incorporated by reference in the certificate) as in the Secretary's judgment will best achieve the purpose of this subsection while protecting the United States from the risk of unreasonable loss and promoting the objectives of this part, including (but not limited to) provisions as to the reporting of such loans and information relevant thereto to the Secretary and as to the payment of initial and other premiums and the effect of default therein, and including provision for confirmation by the Secretary from time to time (through endorsement of the certificate) of the coverage of specific new loans by such certificate, which confirmation shall be incontestable by the Secretary in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation of fact or patent error.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uncovered loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the holder of a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage issued under this subsection grants to a student a line of credit extending beyond the cutoff date specified in that certificate, loans or payments thereon made by the holder after that date pursuant to the line of credit shall not be deemed to be included in the coverage of that certificate except as may be specifically provided therein; but, subject to the limitations of section 1074 of this title, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations, make commitments to insure such future loans or payments, and such commitments may be honored either as provided in subsection (a) of this section or by inclusion of such insurance on comprehensive coverage under the subsection for the period or periods in which such future loans or payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Charges for Federal insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, pursuant to regulations, charge for insurance on each loan under this part a premium in an amount not to exceed one-fourth of 1 percent per year of the unpaid principal amount of such loan (excluding interest added to principal), payable in advance, at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations may provide that such premium shall not be payable, or if paid shall be refundable, with respect to any period after default in the payment of principal or interest or after the borrower has died or becomes totally and permanently disabled, if (1) notice of such default or other event has been duly given, and (2) requests for payment of the loss insured against has been made or the Secretary has made such payment on his own motion pursuant to section 1080(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignability of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rights of an eligible lender arising under insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance issued to it under this section may be assigned as security by such lender only to another eligible lender, and subject to regulation by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consolidation not to affect insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The consolidation of the obligations of two or more federally insured loans obtained by a student borrower in any fiscal year into a single obligation evidenced by a single instrument of indebtedness shall not affect the insurance by the United States. If the loans thus consolidated are covered by separate certificates of insurance issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may upon surrender of the original certificates issue a new certificate of insurance in accordance with that subsection upon the consolidated obligation; if they are covered by a single comprehensive certificate issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may amend that certificate accordingly.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1080. Default of student under Federal loan insurance program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to Secretary and payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon default by the student borrower on any loan covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant to this part, and prior to the commencement of suit or other enforcement proceedings upon security for that loan, the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the Secretary, and the Secretary shall if requested (at that time or after further collection efforts) by the beneficiary, or may on the Secretary's own motion, if the insurance is still in effect, pay to the beneficiary the amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan as soon as that amount has been determined. The &ldquo;amount of the loss&rdquo; on any loan shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the principal amount and accrued interest, including interest accruing from the date of submission of a valid default claim (as determined by the Secretary) to the date on which payment is authorized by the Secretary, reduced to the extent required by section 1075(b) of this title. Such beneficiary shall be required to meet the standards of due diligence in the collection of the loan and shall be required to submit proof that reasonable attempts were made to locate the borrower (when the location of the borrower is unknown) and proof that contact was made with the borrower (when the location is known). The Secretary shall make the determination required to carry out the provisions of this section not later than 90 days after the notification by <!-- PDFPage:333 -->the insurance beneficiary and shall make payment in full on the amount of the beneficiary's loss pending completion of the due diligence investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon payment of the amount of the loss pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated for all of the rights of the holder of the obligation upon the insured loan and shall be entitled to an assignment of the note or other evidence of the insured loan by the insurance beneficiary. If the net recovery made by the Secretary on a loan after deduction of the cost of that recovery (including reasonable administrative costs and collection costs, to the extent set forth in regulations issued by the Secretary) exceeds the amount of the loss, the excess shall be paid over to the insured. The Secretary may, in attempting to make recovery on such loans, contract with private business concerns, State student loan insurance agencies, or State guaranty agencies, for payment for services rendered by such concerns or agencies in assisting the Secretary in making such recovery. Any contract under this subsection entered into by the Secretary shall provide that attempts to make recovery on such loans shall be fair and reasonable, and do not involve harassment, intimidation, false or misleading representations, or unnecessary communications concerning the existence of any such loan to persons other than the student borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forbearance not precluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the student borrower which may be agreed upon by the parties to the insured loan and approved by the Secretary, or to preclude forbearance by the Secretary in the enforcement of the insured obligation after payment on that insurance. Any forbearance which is approved by the Secretary under this subsection with respect to the repayment of a loan, including a forbearance during default, shall not be considered as indicating that a holder of a federally insured loan has failed to exercise reasonable care and due diligence in the collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Care and diligence required of holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to excuse the holder of a federally insured loan from exercising reasonable care and diligence in the making and collection of loans under the provisions of this part. If the Secretary, after a reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to an eligible lender, finds that it has substantially failed to exercise such care and diligence or to make the reports and statements required under section 1078(a)(4) of this title and section 1079(a)(3) of this title, or to pay the required Federal loan insurance premiums, the Secretary shall disqualify that lender for further Federal insurance on loans granted pursuant to this part until the Secretary is satisfied that its failure has ceased and finds that there is reasonable assurance that the lender will in the future exercise necessary care and diligence or comply with such requirements, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Default rate of lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall annually publish a list indicating the cohort default rate (determined in accordance with section 1085(m) of this title) for each originating lender, subsequent holder, and guaranty agency participating in the program assisted under this part and an average cohort default rate for all institutions of higher education within each State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a cohort default rate through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control, or any similar device.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rate establishment and correction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a cohort default rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies (determined consistent with section 1085(m) of this title), except that the rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies shall not reflect any loans issued in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title. The Secretary shall allow institutions, lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies the opportunity to correct such cohort default rate information.</p>

All amounts received by the Secretary as premium charges for insurance and as receipts, earnings, or proceeds derived from any claim or other assets acquired by the Secretary in connection with operations under this part, any excess advances under section 1072 of this title, and any other moneys, property, or assets derived by the Secretary from operations in connection with this section, shall be deposited in the fund. All payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with such guaranty agreements shall be paid from the fund.

Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes and other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter, are extended to include any purchase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treas<!-- PDFPage:336 -->ury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) an explanation of any special options the borrower may have for loan consolidation or other refinancing of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) a statement that the borrower has the right to prepay all or part of the loan, at any time, without penalty, a statement summarizing circumstances in which repayment of the loan or interest that accrues on the loan may be deferred, and a brief notice of the program for repayment of loans, on the basis of military service, pursuant to section 902 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981 (10 U.S.C. 2141, note);<sup><a href="#1083_1_target" name="1083_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) an explanation of any cost the borrower may incur in the making or collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required disclosure before repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each eligible lender shall, at or prior to the start of the repayment period of the student borrower on loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, disclose to the borrower the information required under this subsection. For any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, other than a loan made under section 1078 2 or 1078 3 of this title, such disclosure required by this subsection shall be made not less than 30 days nor more than 240 days before the first payment on the loan is due from the borrower. The disclosure shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the name of the eligible lender, and the address to which communications and payments should be sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the scheduled date upon which the repayment period is to begin;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cost of disclosure and consequences of nondisclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such information shall be available without cost to the borrower. The failure of an eligible lender to provide information as required by this section shall not (1) relieve a borrower of the obligation to repay a loan in accordance with its terms, (2) provide a basis for a claim for civil damages, or (3) be deemed to abrogate the obligation of the Secretary under a contract of insurance or reinsurance, or the obligation of a guaranty agency under a contract of guaranty. Nothing in this section shall be construed as subjecting the lender to the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] with regard to loans made under this part.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of special allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) and paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans shall be computed (i) by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such 3-month period, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rate on such loans from such average, (iii) by adding 3.10 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations, the income from which is exempt from taxation under title 26 shall be one-half the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), except that, in determining the rate for the purpose of this division, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interests or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds. This subparagraph shall not apply to loans which were made or insured prior to October 1, 1980.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Additional documents</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) received a larger amount under this subsection in the second year of participation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">an amount equal to 90 percent of the amount it received under this subsection in its second year of participation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For any fiscal year after a fiscal year in which an institution receives an allocation under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), the Secretary shall allocate to such institution an amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Default reduction and default penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For any fiscal year prior to fiscal year 1994, any institution which has a default rate which equals or exceeds 7.5 percent but does not exceed the maximum default rate applicable to the award year under subsection (g) of this section, the institution's default penalty is a percentage equal to the complement of such default rate. For any institution which has a default rate that does not exceed 7.5 percent, the institution's default penalty is equal to one.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For fiscal year 1994 and any succeeding fiscal year, any institution with a cohort default rate (as defined under subsection (h) of this section) which&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Definitions of default rate and cohort default rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For any award year prior to award year 1994, for the purpose of this section, the default rate is computed by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total principal amount of defaulted loans; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the total principal amount of loans made under this part, less the principal amount of all loans made to borrowers who are eligible <!-- PDFPage:379 -->for deferment under section 1087dd(c)(2)(A)(i) of this title or are in a grace period preceding repayment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(A), the total principal amount of defaulted loans is equal to the total amount borrowed under loans that have reached repayment status and that are in default, minus&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) loans discharged in bankruptcy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) loans referred or assigned to the Secretary for collection under paragraph (5)(A), (5)(B)(i), or (6) of section 1087cc(a) of this title; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For award year 1994 and any succeeding year, the term &ldquo;cohort default rate&rdquo; means, for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter repayment on loans under this part (received for attendance at the institution), the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment on such loans (received for attendance at that institution) in that award year who default before the end of the following award year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining the number of students who default before the end of such award year, the Secretary shall, in calculating the cohort default rate, exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For any award year in which less than 30 of the institution's current and former students enter repayment, the term &ldquo;cohort default rate&rdquo; means the percentage of such current and former students who entered repayment on such loans in any of the three most recent award years and who default before the end of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with such institution, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in default for the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Any loan that is in default but on which the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to resume payment or any loan which has been rehabilitated before the end of such following award year is not considered as in default for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student (and his or her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to the school for attendance at which the student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a default rate determination under this subsection through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control or other means as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A loan shall be considered to be in default&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 240 days (in the case of a loan repayable monthly), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 270 days (in the case of a loan repayable quarterly), after the borrower fails to make an installment payment when due or to comply with other terms of the promissory note,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">after the borrower fails to make an installment payment when due or to comply with other terms of the promissory note.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If an institution of higher education returns to the Secretary any portion of the sums allocated to such institution under this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall reallocate 80 percent of such returned portions to participating institutions in an amount not to exceed such participating institution's excess eligible amounts as determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For the purpose of this subsection, the term &ldquo;participating institution&rdquo; means an institution of higher education that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was a participant in the program assisted under this part in fiscal year 1985; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) did not receive an allocation under subsection (a) of this section in the fiscal year for which the reallocation determination is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Excess eligible amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any participating institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) that institution's eligible amount (as determined under paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of this section), divided by (ii) the sum of the eligible amounts of all participating institutions (as determined under paragraph (3)), multiplied by (iii) the amount of funds available for reallocation under this subsection; exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remainder</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount which bears the same ratio to the balance in such fund at the close of September 30, 1996, as the total amount of the Federal capital contributions to such fund by the Secretary under this part bears to the sum of such Federal contributions and the institution's capital contributions to such fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The remainder of such balance shall be paid to the institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distribution of late collections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After March 31, 2005, each institution with which the Secretary has made an agreement under this part, shall pay to the Secretary the same proportionate share of amounts received by this institution after September 30, 1996, in payment of principal and interest on student loans made from the student loan fund established pursuant to such agreement (which amount shall be determined after deduction of any costs of litigation incurred in collection of the principal or interest on loans from the fund and not already reimbursed from the fund or from such payments of principal or interest), as was determined for the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distribution of excess capital</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to propose modifications in the need analysis methodology required by this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any regulation proposed by the Secretary that (A) updates tables in a manner that does not comply with subsections (b) through (h) of this section, or (B) that proposes modifications under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, shall not be effective unless approved by joint resolution of the Congress by May 1 following the date such regulations are published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title. If the Congress fails to approve such regulations by such May 1, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title updated tables for the applicable award year that are prescribed in accordance with subsections (b) through (h) of this section.</p>

For each age cohort below 40, the allowance shall be computed by decreasing the allowance for age 40, as updated, by one-fifteenth for each year of age below age 40 and rounding the result to the nearest $100. In making such determinations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inflation shall be presumed to be 6 percent per year;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances. However, this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student financial aid administrator in such cases to request and use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting, processing, or delivering such supplementary information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to assets taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in accordance with subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy or an involuntary liquidation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the administrator makes adjustments in the award level of a student with a disability so as to take into consideration the additional costs such student incurs as a result of such student's disability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments for special circumstances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making an adjustment for special circumstances in accordance with subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a dependent student&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such student received a Federal Pell Grant as a dependent student in academic year 1992 1993 and the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1993 1994 is at least $500 less than the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1992  1993; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:407 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the decrease described in clause (i) is the direct result of a change in the determination of such student's need for assistance in accordance with this part that is attributable to the enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a single independent student&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such student received a Federal Pell Grant as a single independent student in academic year 1992  1993 and qualified as an independent student in accordance with section 1087vv(d) of this title for academic year 1993  1994, and the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1993  1994 is at least $500 less than the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1992  1993; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the decrease described in clause (i) is the direct result of a change in the determination of such student's need for assistance in accordance with this part that is attributable to the enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A financial aid administrator shall not make an adjustment for special circumstances pursuant to this subsection in an amount that exceeds one-half of the difference between the amount of a student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1992 1993 and the amount of such student's Federal Pell Grant for academic year 1993 1994.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Academic year limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A financial aid administrator shall make adjustments under this subsection only for Federal Pell Grants awarded for academic years 1993 1994, 1994  1995, and 1995  1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Adjustments under this subsection shall be made in any fiscal year only if an Act that contains an appropriation for such fiscal year to carry out this subsection is enacted on or after December 20, 1993.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Adjustments under this subsection shall not be available for any academic year to any student who, on the basis of the financial circumstances of the student for the current academic year, would not have been eligible for a grant under this section in academic year 1992  1993.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligibility for plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the request of the borrower, a lender described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of sec<!-- PDFPage:436 -->tion 1078 3(a)(1) of this title, or defined in subpart I<sup><a href="#1092a_1_target" name="1092a_1">1</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act may, with respect to a consolidation loan made under section 1078 3 of this title (and section 1087 2(<em>o</em>) of this title as in effect prior to the enactment of section 1078 3 of this title) and loans guaranteed under subpart I<sup><a href="#1092a_1_target" name="1092a_1">1</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (known as Health Education Assistance Loans), offer a combined payment plan under which the lender shall submit one bill to the borrower for the repayment of all such loans for the monthly or other similar period of repayment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applicability of other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A lender offering a combined payment plan shall comply with all provisions of section 1078  3 of this title applicable to loans consolidated or to be consolidated and shall comply with all provisions of subpart I<sup><a href="#1092a_1_target" name="1092a_1">1</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act applicable to loans under that subpart which are made part of the combined payment plan, except that a lender offering a combined payment plan under this section may offer consolidation loans pursuant to section 1078  3(b)(1)(A) of this title if such lender holds any outstanding loan of a borrower which is selected for inclusion in a combined payment plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lender eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such lender may offer a combined payment plan only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the lender holds an outstanding loan of that borrower which is selected by the borrower for incorporation into a combined payment plan pursuant to this section (including loans which are selected by the borrower for consolidation under this section); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower certifies that the borrower has sought and has been unable to obtain a combined payment plan from the holders of the outstanding loans of that borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Borrower selection of competing offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of multiple offers by lenders to administer a combined payment plan for a borrower, the borrower shall select from among them the lender to administer the combined payment plan including its loan consolidation component.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon selection of a lender to administer the combined payment plan, the lender may reissue any Health Education Assistance Loan selected by the borrower for incorporation in the combined payment plan which is not held by such lender and the proceeds of such reissued loan shall be paid by the lender to the holder or holders of the loans so selected to discharge the liability on such loans, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the lender selected to administer the combined payment plan has determined to its satisfaction, in accordance with reasonable and prudent business practices, for each loan being reissued (A) that the loan is a legal, valid, and binding obligation of the borrower; (B) that each such loan was made and serviced in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and (C) the insurance on such loan is in full force and effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the loan being reissued was not in default (as defined in section 733(e)(3)<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act) at the time the request for a combined payment plan is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notes and insurance certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each loan reissued under subsection (e) of this section shall be evidenced by a note executed by the borrower. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall insure such loan under a certificate of comprehensive insurance with no insurance limit, but any such certificate shall only be issued to an authorized holder of loans insured under subpart I<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (including the Student Loan Marketing Association). Such certificates shall provide that all loans reissued under this section shall be fully insured against loss of principal and interest. Any insurance issued with respect to loans reissued under this section shall be excluded from the limitation on maximum insurance authority set forth in section 728(a)<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 729(a)<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act, the reissued loan shall be made in an amount, including outstanding principal, capitalized interest, accrued unpaid interest not yet capitalized, and authorized late charges. The proceeds of each such loan will be paid by the lender to the holder of the original loan being reissued and the borrower's obligation to that holder on that loan shall be discharged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise specifically provided for under the provisions of this section, the terms of any reissued loan shall be the same as the terms of the original loan. The maximum repayment period for a loan reissued under this section shall not exceed the remainder of the period which would have been permitted on the original loan. If the lender holds more than one loan insured under subpart I<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act, the maximum repayment period for all such loans may extend to the latest date permitted for any individual loan. Any reissued loan may be consolidated with any other Health Education Assistance Loan as provided in the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], and, with the concurrence of the borrower, repayment of any such loans during any period may be made in amounts that are less than the interest that accrues on such loans during that period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Termination of borrower eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The status of an individual as an eligible combined payment plan borrower terminates upon receipt of a combined payment plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fees and premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No origination fee or insurance premium shall be charged to the borrower on any combined payment plan, and no origination fee or insurance premium shall be payable by the lender to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Commencement of repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Repayment of a combined payment plan shall commence within 60 days after the later of the <!-- PDFPage:437 -->date of acceptance of the lender's offer to administer a combined payment plan, the making of the consolidation loan or the reissuance of any Health Education Assistance Loans pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No accrediting agency or association may be determined by the Secretary to be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered for the purposes of this chapter or for other Federal purposes, unless the agency or association meets standards established by the Secretary pursuant to this section. The Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, establish standards for such determinations. Such standards shall include an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement. Such standards shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the accrediting agency or association shall be a State, regional, or national agency or association and shall demonstrate the ability and the experience to operate as an accrediting agency or association within the State, region, or nationally, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such agency or association&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) for the purpose of participation in programs under this chapter, has a voluntary membership of institutions of higher education and has as a principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher education; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) and such agency or association has been recognized by the Secretary on or before October 1, 1991, then the Secretary may waive the requirement that such agency or association is separate and independent, both administratively and financially of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization upon a demonstration that the existing relationship has not served to compromise the independence of its accreditation process;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such agency or association consistently applies and enforces standards that ensure that the courses or programs of instruction, training, or study at the institution of higher education are of sufficient quality to achieve, for the duration of the accreditation period, the stated objective for which the courses or the programs are offered;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Operating procedures required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No accrediting agency or association may be approved by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered by an institution seeking to participate in the programs authorized under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, unless the agency or association&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) performs, at regularly established intervals, on-site inspections and reviews of institutions of higher education (at least one of which inspections at each institution that provides vocational education and training shall be unannounced), with particular focus on educational quality and program effectiveness, and ensures that accreditation team members are well-trained and knowledgeable with respect to their responsibilities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action brought by an institution of higher education seeking accreditation from, or accredited by, an accrediting agency or association approved by the Secretary for the purpose of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and involving the denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation of the institution of higher education, shall be brought in the appropriate United States district court.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Change of accrediting agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is in the process of changing its accrediting agency or association, unless the eligible institution submits to the Secretary all materials relating to the prior accreditation, including materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing the accrediting agency or association.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Dual accreditation rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is accredited, as an institution, by <!-- PDFPage:459 -->more than one accrediting agency or association, unless the institution submits to each such agency and association and to the Secretary the reasons for accreditation by more than one such agency or association and demonstrates to the Secretary reasonable cause for its accreditation by more than one agency or association.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is related to the religious mission or affiliation of the institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not related to the accreditation standards provided for in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Limitation, suspension or termination of approval</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may determine that an accrediting agency or association has failed to apply effectively the standards provided in this section if an institution of higher education seeks and receives accreditation from the accrediting agency or association during any period in which the institution is the subject of any interim action by another accrediting agency or association, described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (2)(B), or (2)(C) of subsection (a) of this section, leading to the suspension, revocation, or termination of accreditation or the institution has been notified of the threatened loss of accreditation, and the due process procedures required by such suspension, revocation, termination, or threatened loss have not been completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Limitation on Secretary's authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may only recognize accrediting agencies or associations which accredit institutions of higher education for the purpose of enabling such institutions to establish eligibility to participate in the programs under this chapter or which accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling them to establish eligibility to participate in other programs administered by the Department of Education or other Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Independent evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of the performance of all accrediting agencies or associations which seek recognition by the Secretary in order to determine whether such accrediting agencies or associations meet the standards established by this section. The Secretary shall conduct an independent evaluation of the information provided by such agency or association. Such evaluation shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the solicitation of third-party information concerning the performance of the accrediting agency or association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) site visits, including unannounced site visits as appropriate, at accrediting agencies and associations, and, at the Secretary's discretion, at representative member institutions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall place a priority for review of accrediting agencies or associations on those agencies or associations that accredit institutions of higher education that participate most extensively in the programs authorized by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and on those agencies or associations which have been the subject of the most complaints or legal actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall consider all available relevant information concerning the compliance of the accrediting agency or association with the standards provided for in this section, including any complaints or legal actions against such agency or association. In cases where deficiencies in the performance of an accreditation agency or association with respect to the requirements of this section are noted, the Secretary shall take these deficiencies into account in the approval process. The Secretary shall not, under any circumstances, base decisions on the approval or disapproval of accreditation agencies or associations on standards other than those contained in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall maintain sufficient documentation to support the conclusions reached in the approval process, and, upon disapproval of any accreditation agency or association, shall make publicly available the reason for such disapproval, including reference to the specific standards under this section which have not been fulfilled.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State educational agency receiving funds reserved pursuant to section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title shall use such funds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) first, to conduct a study of teacher education programs within such State, as required under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) secondly, for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the establishment of State Academies for Teachers under section 1102d of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of State Academies for School Leaders under section 1102e of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) activities directly related to the implementation of the teacher education study required under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State educational agency can demonstrate that the amount of funds reserved pursuant to <!-- PDFPage:471 -->section 1102(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this title is insufficient to establish one State academy, then the State educational agency shall distribute such funds to local educational agencies in accordance with section 1102(b)(2)(A) or 1102(c) of this title to carry out the activities described in section 1102b(b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State educational agency receiving funds under this part shall, in consultation with institutions of higher education, local educational agencies, teachers, parents, the State legislature, the State board of education, and business, undertake a study of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) teacher education programs and State teacher professional development requirements, including programs and requirements intended to train preschool and early childhood education specialists; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State laws and regulations relating to such programs and requirements, including any standards or requirements for certification and licensure,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to determine if such programs and requirements are adequately preparing teachers to effectively educate students.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such study shall consider whether such programs or requirements&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) would be improved if teacher education programs were required to coordinate courses with other departments on campus in order to provide prospective teachers with a strong background in their subject matter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) integrate academic and vocational education instruction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) give enough flexibility in order to allow experimentation and innovation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) would be improved if such programs provided preparation for students desiring to become teachers, but who are pursuing a bachelor's degree in an area of study other than education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) would be improved if teacher certification required a bachelor's degree in a subject area and a master's degree in education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) would be improved if institutions of higher education that have developed innovative materials and curricula for inservice training were required to incorporate these improvements into their preservice programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deadlines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Such study shall be completed by two years from the end of the first fiscal year in which funding was made available for this part.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to implement the program and policy changes resulting from the findings of such study; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to assist schools and programs of education throughout the State in meeting any new requirements that result from such study.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) over the past 50 years institutions of higher education have expanded dramatically, while at the same time traditional sources of funding facilities maintenance and repair have declined and even disappeared in some instances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in order to meet the rising cost of educating students, resulting mainly from inflation and the higher costs of research, many colleges and universities made the choice to defer renovations and improvements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) overall, the need for capital investment by institutions of higher education has been estimated to exceed $60,000,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the deterioration of facilities has caused valuable research experiments and programs to be postponed, delayed or canceled; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the United States&rsquo; competitive position within the world economy is vulnerable if the necessary research facilities are not available to provide advanced training in the fields of science and technology.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in section 1132c 3 of this title, the Secretary is authorized to enter into insurance agreements to provide financial insurance to guarantee the full payment of principal and interest on qualified bonds upon the conditions set forth in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Responsibilities of designated bonding authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not enter into an insurance agreement described in subsection (a) of this section unless the Secretary designates a qualified bonding authority in accordance with sections 1132c 4(1) and 1132c  5 of this title and the designated bonding authority agrees in such agreement to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use the proceeds of the qualified bonds, less costs of issuance not to exceed 2 percent of the principal amount thereof, to make loans to eligible institutions or for deposit into an escrow account for repayment of the bonds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that not less than 95 percent of the proceeds of the loan will be used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to finance the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, construction or acquisition, of a capital project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refinance an obligation the proceeds of which were used to finance the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, construction or acquisition, of a capital project;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) charge such interest on loans, and provide for such a schedule of repayments of loans, as will, upon the timely repayment of the loans, provide adequate and timely funds for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require that any payment on a loan expected to be necessary to make a payment of principal and interest on the bonds be due not less than 60 days prior to the date of the payment on the bonds for which such loan payment is expected to be needed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) prior to the making of any loan, provide for a credit review of the institution receiving the loan and assure the Secretary that, on the basis of such credit review, it is reasonable to anticipate that the institution receiving the loan will be able to repay the loan in a timely manner pursuant to the terms thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that, if a delinquency on such loan results in a funding under the insurance agreement, the institution obligated on such loan shall repay the Secretary, upon terms to be determined by the Secretary, for such funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) assign any loans to the Secretary, upon the demand of the Secretary, if a delinquency on such loan has required a funding under the insurance agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in the event of a delinquency on a loan, engage in such collection efforts as the Secretary shall require for a period of not less than 45 days prior to requesting a funding under the insurance agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) establish an escrow account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) into which each eligible institution shall deposit 10 percent of the proceeds of any loan made under this part, with each eligible institution required to maintain in the escrow account an amount equal to 10 percent of the outstanding principal of all loans made to such institution under this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the balance of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be available to the Secretary to pay principal and interest on the bonds in the event of delinquency in loan repayment; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that, if a delinquency on such loan results in amounts being withdrawn from the escrow account to pay principal and interest on bonds, subsequent payments on such loan shall be available to replenish such escrow account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) comply with the limitations set forth in section 1132c 3 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) make loans only to eligible institutions under this part in accordance with conditions prescribed by the Secretary to ensure that loans are fairly allocated among as many eligible institutions as possible, consistent with making loans of amounts that will permit capital projects of sufficient size and scope to significantly contribute to the educational program of the eligible institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional agreement provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any insurance agreement described in subsection (a) of this section shall provide as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal liability for delinquencies and default for bonds guaranteed under this part shall only become effective upon the exhaustion of all the funds held in the escrow account described in subsection (b)(8) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary shall create a letter of credit authorizing the Department of the Treasury to disburse funds to the designated bonding authority or its assignee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The letter of credit shall be drawn upon in the amount determined by paragraph (5) of this subsection upon the certification of the designated bonding authority to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee that there is a delinquency on 1 or more loans and there are insufficient funds available from loan repayments and the escrow account to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest on the bonds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Upon receipt by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee of the certification described <!-- PDFPage:538 -->in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the designated bonding authority may draw a funding under the letter of credit in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount required to make the next scheduled payment of principal and interest on the bonds, less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount available to the designated bonding authority from loan repayments and the escrow account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) All funds provided under the letter of credit shall be paid to the designated bonding authority within 2 business days following receipt of the certification described in paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Full faith and credit provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (c)(1) of this section the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all funds which may be required to be paid under the provisions of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Public benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that, if a facility constructed with the aid of a grant under part A of this subchapter, or part B of this subchapter as such part was in effect prior to July 23, 1992, is used as an academic facility for 20 years following completion of such construction, the public benefit accruing to the United States will equal in value the amount of the grant. The period of 20 years after completion of such construction shall therefore be deemed to be the period of Federal interest in such facility for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recovery upon cessation of public benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, within 20 years after completion of construction of an academic facility which has been constructed, in part with a grant under part A of this subchapter, or part B of this subchapter as such part was in effect prior to July 23, 1992&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the facility ceases to be used as an academic facility, or the facility is used as a facility excluded from the term &ldquo;academic facility&rdquo;, unless the Secretary determines that there is good cause for releasing the institution from its obligation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the United States shall be entitled to recover from such applicant (or successor) an amount which bears to the value of the facility at that time (or so much thereof as constituted an approved project or projects) the same ratio as the amount of Federal grant bore to the cost of the facility financed with the aid of such grant. The value shall be determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in the United States district court for the district in which such facility is situated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibition on use for religion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, no project assisted with funds under this subchapter shall ever be used for religious worship or a sectarian activity or for a school or department of divinity.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reservations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reserve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 50 percent of the amount appropriated pursuant to the authority of section 1134g of this title to award grants to institutions of higher education to enable such institutions to make awards for master's level and professional study; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 50 percent of such amount to award grants to such institutions to enable such institutions to make awards for doctoral study.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) take into account present and projected needs for highly trained individuals in academic career fields of high national priority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider the need to prepare a larger number of women and individuals from minority groups, especially from among such groups which have been traditionally underrepresented in professional and academic careers requiring master's level, professional, or doctoral degrees, but nothing contained in this paragraph shall be interpreted to require any institution to grant preference or disparate treatment to the members of one minority group on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of individuals of such group participating in or receiving the benefits of the program authorized in this section, in comparison with the total number or percentage of individuals of such group in any community, State, section, or other area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) take into account the need to expand access by women and minority groups to careers heretofore lacking adequate representation of women and minority groups; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Priorities for fellowships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall assure that, in making grants under this part, a priority for awards is accorded to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) individuals from minority groups and women who are pursuing master's level or professional study in fields in which they are underrepresented;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to individuals who first receive fellowships during or after academic year 1993  1994&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) $9,000 for the academic year 1993 1994; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for succeeding academic years, $9,000 adjusted annually thereafter in accordance with inflation as determined by the Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for the previous calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Over 150,000 youth offenders age 21 and younger are incarcerated in the Nation's jails, juvenile facilities, and prisons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Most youth offenders who are incarcerated have been sentenced as first-time adult felons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Approximately 75 percent of youth offenders are high school dropouts who lack basic literacy and life skills, have little or no job experience, and lack marketable skills.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The average incarcerated youth has attended school only through grade 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Most of these youths can be diverted from a life of crime into productive citizenship with available educational, vocational, work skills, and related service programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) If not involved with educational programs while incarcerated, almost all of these youths will return to a life of crime upon release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The average length of sentence for a youth offender is about 3 years. Time spent in prison provides a unique opportunity for education and training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Even with quality education and training provided during incarceration, a period of intense supervision, support, and counseling is needed upon release to ensure effective reintegration of youth offenders into society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Research consistently shows that the vast majority of incarcerated youths will not return to the public schools to complete their education.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:584 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) There is a need for alternative educational opportunities during incarceration and after release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Youth offender&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;youth offender&rdquo; means a male or female offender under the age of 25, who is incarcerated in a State prison, including a prerelease facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Grant program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a program in accordance with this section to provide grants to the State correctional education agencies to assist and encourage incarcerated youths to acquire functional literacy, life, and job skills, through the pursuit of a postsecondary education certificate, or an associate of arts or bachelor's degree while in prison, and employment counseling and other related services which start during incarceration and continue through prerelease and while on parole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State correctional education agency shall submit to the Secretary a proposal for a youth offender program that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) lists the accredited public or private educational institution or institutions that will provide postsecondary educational services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) lists the cooperating agencies, public and private, or businesses that will provide related services, such as counseling in the areas of career development, substance abuse, health, and parenting skills;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) describes the evaluation methods and performance measures that the State correctional education agency will employ, provided that such methods and measures are appropriate to meet the goals and objectives of the proposal, and that such methods and measures include measures of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) program completion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) student academic and vocational skill attainment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) success in job placement and retention; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) recidivism;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) describes how the proposed programs are to be integrated with existing State correctional education programs (such as adult education, graduate education degree programs, and vocational training) and State industry programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) addresses the educational needs of youth offenders who are in alternative programs (such as boot camps); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) describes how students will be selected so that only youth offenders eligible under subsection (f) of this section will be enrolled in postsecondary programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Program requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State correctional education agency receiving a grant under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) integrate activities carried out under the grant with the objectives and activities of the school-to-work programs of such State, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) work experience or apprenticeship programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) transitional worksite job training for vocational education students that is related to the occupational goals of such students and closely linked to classroom and laboratory instruction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) placement services in occupations that the students are preparing to enter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) employment-based learning programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) programs that address State and local labor shortages;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) annually report to the Secretary and the Attorney General on the results of the evaluations conducted using the methods and performance measures contained in the proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide to each State for each student eligible under subsection (f) of this section not more than $1,500 annually for tuition, books, and essential materials, and not more than $300 annually for related services such as career development, substance abuse counseling, parenting skills training, and health education, for each eligible incarcerated youth.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Student eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A youth offender shall be eligible for participation in a program receiving a grant under this section if the youth offender&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is eligible to be released within five years (including a youth offender who is eligible for parole within such time); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is 25 years of age or younger.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Length of participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State correctional education agency receiving a grant under this section shall provide educational and related services to each participating youth offender for a period not to exceed 5 years, 1 year of which may be devoted to study in a graduate education degree program or to remedial education services for students who have obtained a secondary school diploma. Educational and related services shall start during the period of incarceration in prison or prerelease and may continue during the period of parole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Education delivery systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">State correctional education agencies and cooperating institutions shall, to the extent practicable, use high-tech applications in developing programs to meet the requirements and goals of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Allocation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From the amounts appropriated pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, the Secretary shall allot to each State an amount that bears the same relationship to such funds as the total number of students eligible under subsection (f) of this section in such State bears to the total number of such students in all States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1995 and such sums as may be necessary for fis<!-- PDFPage:585 -->cal year 1996 and each of the four succeeding fiscal years.</p>
