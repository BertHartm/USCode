<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may also make grants to such departments and programs and to other units of institutions of higher education granting graduate degrees which submit joint proposals involving nondegree granting institutions which have formal arrangements for the support of doctoral dissertation research with degree-granting institutions. Nondegree granting institutions eligible for awards as part of such joint proposals include any organization which&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Award and duration of grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Awards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The principal criterion for the allocation of awards shall be the relative quality of the graduate programs presented in competing applications.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duration</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preference to continuing grant recipients</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
