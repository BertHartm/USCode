<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Consistency with State policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agency, in providing for the education of children with disabilities within its jurisdiction, has in effect policies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with the State policies and procedures established under section 1412 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be used to supplement State, local, and other Federal funds and not to supplant such funds; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:663 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not be used, except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), to reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with disabilities made by the local educational agency from local funds below the level of those expenditures for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the restriction in subparagraph (A)(iii), a local educational agency may reduce the level of expenditures where such reduction is attributable to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with this subchapter, to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the State educational agency, because the child&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide a free appropriate public education to the child has terminated; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if a State educational agency determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the requirements of this subchapter, the State educational agency may prohibit the local educational agency from treating funds received under this subchapter as local funds under clause (i) for any fiscal year, only if it is authorized to do so by the State constitution or a State statute.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Charter school exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State educational agency may not require a charter school that is a local educational agency to jointly establish its eligibility under subparagraph (A) unless it is explicitly permitted to do so under the State's charter school statute.</p>
