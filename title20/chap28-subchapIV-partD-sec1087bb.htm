<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this part in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year preceding fiscal year 2000, any institution with a cohort default rate that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) equals or exceeds 15 percent, shall establish a default reduction plan pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, except that such plan shall not be required with respect to an institution that has a default rate of less than 20 percent and that has less than 100 students who have loans under this part in such academic year;</p>

The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal within 45 days after the submission of the appeal. Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the calculation of the institution's cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce the institution's cohort default rate for any of the 3 fiscal years below 50 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, such a small number of borrowers entering repayment that the application of this subparagraph would be inequitable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount which bears the same ratio to such balance (as of the date of such distribution) as the total amount of Federal capital contributions to such fund by the Secretary under this part bears to the sum of such Federal capital contributions and the capital contributions to such fund made by the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The remainder of such student loan fund shall be paid to the institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For any award year in which less than 30 of the institution's current and former students enter repayment, the term &ldquo;cohort default rate&rdquo; means the percentage of such current and former students who entered repayment on such loans in any of the three most recent award years and who default before the end of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with such institution, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in default for the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student (and his or her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to the school for attendance at which the student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a cohort default rate determination under this subsection through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control or other means as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under this subsection, a loan shall be considered to be in default&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 240 days (in the case of a loan repayable monthly), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 270 days (in the case of a loan repayable quarterly),</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Excess eligible amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any participating institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) that institution's eligible amount (as determined under subsection (b)(3) of this section), divided by (ii) the sum of the eligible amounts of all participating institutions (as determined under paragraph (3)), multiplied by (iii) the amount of funds available for reallocation under this subsection; exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remainder</h4>

The Secretary may waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that enforcing it is contrary to the interest of the program.</p>
