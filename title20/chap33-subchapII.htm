<p class="statutory-body">A State is eligible for assistance under this subchapter for a fiscal year if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets each of the following conditions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Free appropriate public education</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities residing in the State between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The obligation to make a free appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities does not apply with respect to children:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) aged 3 through 5 and 18 through 21 in a State to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, respecting the provision of public education to children in those age ranges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) aged 18 through 21 to the extent that State law does not require that special education and related services under this subchapter be provided to children with disabilities who, in the educational placement prior to their incarceration in an adult correctional facility:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) were not actually identified as being a child with a disability under section 1401(3) of this title; or</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this chapter requires that children be classified by their disability so long as each child who has a disability listed in section 1401 of this title and who, by reason of that disability, needs special education and related services is regarded as a child with a disability under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Individualized education program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individualized education program, or an individualized family service plan that meets the requirements of section 1436(d) of this title, is developed, reviewed, and revised for each child with a disability in accordance with section 1414(d) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional requirement</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the State uses a funding mechanism by which the State distributes State funds on the basis of the type of setting in which a child is served, the funding mechanism does not result in placements that violate the requirements of subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the State does not have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with clause (i), the State shall provide the Secretary an assurance that it will revise the funding mechanism as soon as feasible to ensure that such mechanism does not result in such placements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Procedural safeguards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Procedures to ensure that testing and evaluation materials and procedures utilized for the purposes of evaluation and placement of children with disabilities will be selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory. Such materials or procedures shall be provided and administered in the child's native language or mode of communication, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, and no single procedure shall be the sole criterion for determining an appropriate educational program for a child.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Children with disabilities are evaluated in accordance with subsections (a) through (c) of section 1414 of this title.</p>

By the third birthday of such a child, an individualized education program or, if consistent with sections 1414(d)(2)(B) and 1436(d) of this title, an individualized family service plan, has been developed and is being implemented for the child. The local educational agency will participate in transition planning conferences arranged by the designated lead agency under section 1437(a)(8) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Child-find requirement</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Reimbursement for private school placement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private elementary or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Children with disabilities are included in general State and district-wide assessment programs, with appropriate accommodations, where necessary. As appropriate, the State or local educational agency&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with this subchapter, to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the State educational agency, because the child&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if a State educational agency determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the requirements of this subchapter, the State educational agency may prohibit the local educational agency from treating funds received under this subchapter as local funds under clause (i) for any fiscal year, only if it is authorized to do so by the State constitution or a State statute.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Withholding of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State educational agency involved (and to any local educational agency or State agency affected by any failure described in subparagraph (B)), finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that there has been a failure by the State to comply substantially with any provision of this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that there is a failure to comply with any condition of a local educational agency's or State agency's eligibility under this subchapter, including the terms of any agreement to achieve compliance with this subchapter within the timelines specified in the agreement;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary shall, after notifying the State educational agency, withhold, in whole or in part, any further payments to the State under this subchapter, or refer the matter for appropriate enforcement action, which may include referral to the Department of Justice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nature of withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary withholds further payments under paragraph (1), the Secretary may determine that such withholding will be limited to programs or projects, or portions thereof, affected by the failure, or that the State educational agency shall not make further payments under this subchapter to specified local educational agencies or State agencies affected by the failure. Until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any failure to comply with the provisions of this subchapter, as specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), payments to the State under this subchapter shall be withheld in whole or in part, or payments by the State educational agency under this subchapter shall be limited to local educational agencies and State agencies whose actions did not cause or were not involved in the failure, as the case may be. Any State educational agency, State agency, or local educational agency that has received notice under paragraph (1) shall, by means of a public notice, take such measures as may be necessary to bring the pendency of an action pursuant to this subsection to the attention of the public within the jurisdiction of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any State is dissatisfied with the Secretary's final action with respect to the eligibility of the State under section 1412 of this title, such State may, not later than 60 days after notice of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of that action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings upon which the Secretary's action was based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction; review by United States Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:674 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Standard of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Divided State agency responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, where responsibility for ensuring that the requirements of this subchapter are met with respect to children with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons is assigned to a public agency other than the State educational agency pursuant to section 1412(a)(11)(C) of this title, the Secretary, in instances where the Secretary finds that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of this subchapter are related to a failure by the public agency, shall take appropriate corrective action to ensure compliance with this subchapter, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any reduction or withholding of payments to the State is proportionate to the total funds allotted under section 1411 of this title to the State as the number of eligible children with disabilities in adult prisons under the supervision of the other public agency is proportionate to the number of eligible individuals with disabilities in the State under the supervision of the State educational agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any withholding of funds under paragraph (1) shall be limited to the specific agency responsible for the failure to comply with this subchapter.</p>
