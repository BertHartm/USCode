<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term &ldquo;average per pupil expenditure&rdquo;, in the United States, means the aggregate current expenditures, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the computation is made (or, if satisfactory data for such year are not available at the time of computation, then during the most recent preceding fiscal year for which satisfactory data are available) of all local educational agencies in the United States (which, for purposes of this subsection, means the fifty States and the District of Columbia), as the case may be, plus any direct expenditures by the State for operation of such agencies (without regard to the source of funds from which either of such expenditures are made), divided by the aggregate number of children in average daily attendance to whom such agencies provided free public education during such preceding year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive; but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Upon the filing of a petition under subparagraph (B), the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) procedures designed to assure that the notice required by clause (C) fully informs the parents or guardian, in the parents&rsquo; or guardian's native language, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, of all procedures available pursuant to this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) an opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of local decision by State educational agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the hearing required in paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section is conducted by a local educational agency or an intermediate educational unit, any party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing may appeal to the State educational agency which shall conduct an impartial review of such hearing.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Civil action; jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A decision made in a hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section shall be final, except that any party involved in such hearing may appeal such decision under the provisions of subsection (c) and paragraph (2) of this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under subsection (b) of this section who does not have the right to an appeal under subsection (c) of this section, and any party aggrieved by the findings and decision under subsection (c) of this section, shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented pursuant to this section, which action may be brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy. In any action brought under this paragraph the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its decision on the preponderance of the <!-- PDFPage:691 -->evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency and the parents or guardian otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child, or, if applying for initial admission to a public school, shall, with the consent of the parents or guardian, be placed in the public school program until all such proceedings have been completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (iii), if the proceedings conducted pursuant to this section involve a child with a disability who is determined to have brought a weapon to school under the jurisdiction of such agency, then the child may be placed in an interim alternative educational setting, in accordance with State law, for not more than 45 days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any action or proceeding brought under this subsection, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees as part of the costs to the parents or guardian of a child or youth with a disability who is the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purpose of this subsection, fees awarded under this subsection shall be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished. No bonus or multiplier may be used in calculating the fees awarded under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) No award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and related costs may be made in any action or proceeding under this subsection for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent or guardian, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the offer is made within the time prescribed by Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, in the case of an administrative proceeding, at any time more than ten days before the proceeding begins;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the offer is not accepted within ten days; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the court or administrative officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the parents or guardian is not more favorable to the parents or guardian than the offer of settlement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (D), an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and related costs may be made to a parent or guardian who is the prevailing party and who was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Whenever the court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the parent or guardian, during the course of the action or proceeding, unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of the attorneys&rsquo; fees otherwise authorized to be awarded unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the time spent and legal services furnished were excessive considering the nature of the action or proceeding,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the court shall reduce, accordingly, the amount of the attorneys&rsquo; fees awarded under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) The provisions of subparagraph (F) shall not apply in any action or proceeding if the court finds that the State or local educational agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding or there was a violation of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect on other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 790 et seq.], or other Federal statutes protecting the rights of children and youth with disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter, the procedures under subsections (b)(2) and (c) of this section shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.</p>
