<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8352. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Physical education is essential to the development of growing children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Physical education helps improve the overall health of children by improving their cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and power, and flexibility, and by enhancing weight regulation, bone development, posture, skillful moving, active lifestyle habits, and constructive use of leisure time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Physical education helps improve the self esteem, interpersonal relationships, responsible behavior, and independence of children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be more healthy and physically fit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The percentage of young people who are overweight has more than doubled in the 30 years preceding 1999.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Low levels of activity contribute to the high prevalence of obesity among children in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Obesity related diseases cost the United States economy more than $100,000,000,000 every year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Inactivity and poor diet cause at least 300,000 deaths a year in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Physically fit adults have significantly reduced risk factors for heart attacks and stroke.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Children are not as active as they should be and fewer than one in four children get 20 minutes of vigorous activity every day of the week.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The Surgeon General's 1996 Report on Physical Activity and Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommend daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Twelve years after Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 97, 100th Congress, agreed to December 11, 1987, encouraging State and local governments and local educational agencies to provide high quality daily physical education programs for all children in kindergarten through grade 12, little progress has been made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Every student in our Nation's schools, from kindergarten through grade 12, should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education. It is the unique role of quality physical education programs to develop the health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for all students so that the students can adopt healthy and physically active lifestyles.</p>
