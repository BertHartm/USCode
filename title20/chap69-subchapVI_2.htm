<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that chapter 2 of title I of this Act (as such chapter was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) has been successful in achieving the goals of increasing local flexibility, reducing administrative burden, providing services for private school students, encouraging innovation, and contributing to the improvement of elementary and secondary educational programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1237 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of programs under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to support local education reform efforts which are consistent with and support statewide reform efforts under Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to support State and local efforts to accomplish the National Education Goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide funding to enable State and local educational agencies to implement promising educational reform programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide a continuing source of innovation, and educational improvement, including support for library services and instructional and media materials; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to meet the special educational needs of at risk and high cost students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State and local responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basic responsibility for the administration of funds made available under this subchapter is within the State educational agencies, but it is the intent of Congress that the responsibility be carried out with a minimum of paperwork and that the responsibility for the design and implementation of programs assisted under this subchapter will be mainly that of local educational agencies, school superintendents and principals, and classroom teachers and supporting personnel, because such agencies and individuals have the most direct contact with students and are most likely to be able to design programs to meet the educational needs of students in their own school districts.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maintenance of effort</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a State is entitled to receive its full allocation of funds under this part for any fiscal year if the Secretary finds that either the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures within the State with respect to the provision of free public education for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made was not less than 90 percent of such combined fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduction of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allocation of funds under this part in any fiscal year in the exact proportion to which the State fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) by falling below 90 percent of both the fiscal effort per student and aggregate expenditures (using the measure most favorable to the State), and no such lesser amount shall be used for computing the effort required under paragraph (1) for subsequent years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Waivers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may waive, for one fiscal year only, the requirements of this section if the Secretary determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Federal funds supplementary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State or local educational agency may use and allocate funds received under this part only so as to supplement and, to the extent practical, increase the level of funds that would, in the absence of Federal funds made available under this part, be made available from non-Federal sources, and in no case may such funds be used so as to supplant funds from non-Federal sources.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Participation on equitable basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent consistent with the number of children in the school district of a local educational agency which is eligible to receive funds under this subchapter or which serves the area in which a program or project assisted under this subchapter is located who are enrolled in private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools, or with respect to instructional or personnel training programs funded by the State educational agency from funds made available for State use, such agency, after consultation with appropriate private school officials, shall provide for the benefit of such children in such schools secular, neutral, and nonideological services, materials, and equipment, including the participation of the teachers of such children (and other educational personnel serving such children) in training programs, and the repair, minor remodeling, or construction of public facilities as may be necessary for their provision (consistent with subsection (c) of this section), or, if such services, materials, and equipment are not feasible or necessary in one or more such private schools as determined by the local <!-- PDFPage:1241 -->educational agency after consultation with the appropriate private school officials, shall provide such other arrangements as will assure equitable participation of such children in the purposes and benefits of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other provisions for services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no program or project is carried out under paragraph (1) in the school district of a local educational agency, the State educational agency shall make arrangements, such as through contracts with nonprofit agencies or organizations, under which children in private schools in such district are provided with services and materials to the extent that would have occurred if the local educational agency had received funds under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of this section relating to the participation of children, teachers, and other personnel serving such children shall apply to programs and projects carried out under this subchapter by a State or local educational agency, whether directly or through grants to or contracts with other public or private agencies, institutions, or organizations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Equal expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Expenditures for programs pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be equal (consistent with the number of children to be served) to expenditures for programs under this subchapter for children enrolled in the public schools of the local educational agency, taking into account the needs of the individual children and other factors which relate to such expenditures, and when funds available to a local educational agency under this subchapter are used to concentrate programs or projects on a particular group, attendance area, or grade or age level, children enrolled in private schools who are included within the group, attendance area, or grade or age level selected for such concentration shall, after consultation with the appropriate private school officials, be assured equitable participation in the purposes and benefits of such programs or projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Administration of funds and property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The control of funds provided under this subchapter, and title to materials, equipment, and property repaired, remodeled, or constructed with such funds, shall be in a public agency for the uses and purposes provided in this subchapter, and a public agency shall administer such funds and property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Provision of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provision of services pursuant to this subchapter shall be provided by employees of a public agency or through contract by such public agency with a person, an association, agency, or corporation who or which, in the provision of such services, is independent of such private school and of any religious organizations, and such employment or contract shall be under the control and supervision of such public agency, and the funds provided under this subchapter shall not be commingled with State or local funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State prohibition waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If by reason of any provision of law a State or local educational agency is prohibited from providing for the participation in programs of children enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools, as required by this section, the Secretary shall waive such requirements and shall arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements which shall be subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver and provision of services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a State or a local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling to provide for the participation on an equitable basis of children enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools as required by this section, the Secretary may waive such requirements and shall arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements which shall be subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withholding of allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pending final resolution of any investigation or complaint that could result in a determination under this subsection or subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary may withhold from the allocation of the affected State or local educational agency the amount estimated by the Secretary to be necessary to pay the cost of those services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any determination by the Secretary under this section shall continue in effect until the Secretary determines that there will no longer be any failure or inability on the part of the State or local educational agency to meet the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment from State allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the Secretary arranges for services pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall, after consultation with the appropriate public and private school officials, pay the cost of such services, including the administrative costs of arranging for those services, from the appropriate allotment of the State under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Written objections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall not take any final action under this section until the State educational agency and the local educational agency affected by such action have had an opportunity, for not less than 45 days after receiving written notice thereof, to submit written objections and to appear before the Secretary or the Secretary's designee to show cause why that action should not be taken.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Court action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State or local educational agency is dissatisfied with the Secretary's final action after a proceeding under paragraph (1), such agency may, not later than 60 days after notice of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such <!-- PDFPage:1242 -->State is located a petition for review of that action. A copy of the petition shall be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which the Secretary based this action, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remand to Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive; but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence and the Secretary may make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Court review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set such action aside, in whole or in part.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Prior determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any bypass determination by the Secretary under chapter 2 of title I of this Act (as such chapter was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) shall, to the extent consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, apply to programs under this subchapter.</p>
