<p class="note-body">Section 7111 of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(1), was in the original &ldquo;section 4111&rdquo;, meaning section 4111 of Pub. L. 89&ndash;10, which was translated as reading section 4011 of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 89&ndash;10 does not contain a section 4111, but does contain a section 4011 which relates to State allotments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Goals 2000: Educate America Act, referred to in subsec. (a)(1), is Pub. L. 103&ndash;227, Mar. 31, 1994, 108 Stat. 125 (except titles V and IX), as amended, which is classified principally to chapter 68 (&sect;5801 et seq.) of this title (except subchapters V (&sect;5931 et seq.) and IX (&sect;6001 et seq.)).
