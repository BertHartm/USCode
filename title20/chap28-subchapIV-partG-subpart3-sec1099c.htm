<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provides, at the option of the institution, for participation in one or more of the programs under part B or C of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Financial responsibility standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall determine whether an institution has the financial responsibility required by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 on the basis of whether the institution is able&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if an institution fails to meet criteria prescribed by the Secretary regarding ratios that demonstrate financial responsibility, then the institution shall provide the Secretary with satisfactory evidence of its financial responsibility in accordance with paragraph (3). Such criteria shall take into account any differences in generally accepted accounting principles, and the financial statements required thereunder, that are applicable to for profit, public, and nonprofit institutions. The Secretary shall take into account an institution's total financial circumstances in making a determination of its ability to meet the standards herein required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall determine an institution to be financially responsible, notwithstanding the institution's failure to meet the criteria under paragraphs (1) and (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such institution submits to the Secretary third-party financial guarantees that the Secretary determines are reasonable, such as performance bonds or letters of credit payable to the Secretary, which third-party financial guarantees shall equal not less than one-half of the annual potential liabilities of such institution to the Secretary for funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, including loan obligations discharged pursuant to section 1087 of this title, and to students for refunds of institutional charges, including funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an institution of higher education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction for which the institution awards an associate or baccalaureate degree fails to meet the criteria imposed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall waive that particular requirement for that institution if the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there is no reasonable doubt as to its continued solvency and ability to deliver quality educational services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is current in its payment of all current liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and withholding taxes; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The determination as to whether an institution has met the standards of financial responsibility provided for in paragraphs (2) and (3)(C) shall be based on an audited and certified financial statement of the institution. Such audit shall be conducted by a qualified independent organization or person in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Such statement shall be submitted to the Secretary at the time such institution is considered for certification or recertification under this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall provide for a process under which the Secretary shall exempt an institution of higher education from the requirements described in subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that the institution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is located in a State that has a tuition recovery fund that ensures that the institution meets the requirements of subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) contributes to the fund; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the assumption of personal liability, by one or more individuals who exercise substantial control over such institution, as determined by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2), for financial losses to the Federal Government, student assistance recipients, and other program participants for funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, and civil and criminal monetary penalties authorized under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, an ownership interest is defined as a share of the legal or beneficial ownership or control of, or a right to share in the proceeds of the operation of, an institution or institution's parent corporation. An ownership interest may include, but is not limited to&mdash;</p>
