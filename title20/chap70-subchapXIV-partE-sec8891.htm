<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A local educational agency may receive funds under a covered program for any fiscal year only if the State educational agency finds that either the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of such agency and the State with respect to the provision of free public education by such agency for the preceding fiscal year was not less than 90 percent of such combined fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the second preceding fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
