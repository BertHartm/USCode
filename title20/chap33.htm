<p class="statutory-body">This chapter may be cited as the &ldquo;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are more than eight million children with disabilities in the United States today;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the special educational needs of such children are not being fully met;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) more than half of the children with disabilities in the United States do not receive appropriate educational services which would enable them to have full equality of opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) one million of the children with disabilities in the United States are excluded entirely from the public school system and will not go through the educational process with their peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there are many children with disabilities throughout the United States participating in regular school programs whose disabilities prevent them from having a successful educational experience because their disabilities are undetected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) because of the lack of adequate services within the public school system, families are often forced to find services outside the public school system, often at great distance from their residence and at their own expense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) developments in the training of teachers and in diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods have advanced to the point that, given appropriate funding, State and local educational agencies can and will provide effective special education and related services to meet the needs of children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) State and local educational agencies have a responsibility to provide education for all children with disabilities, but present finan<!-- PDFPage:682 -->cial resources are inadequate to meet the special educational needs of children with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) it is in the national interest that the Federal Government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities in order to assure equal protection of the law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them, within the time periods specified in section 1412(2)(B) of this title, a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Plan for implementation of authorized programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall maintain a process for developing a program plan for the implementation of each of the programs authorized under section 1418 of this title and subchapters III through VII of this chapter.

The Secretary shall require their delivery, as appropriate, to the Regional and Federal Resource Centers, the Clearinghouses, and the Technical Assistance to Parents Programs (TAPP) assisted under subchapters III and IV of this chapter, as well as the National Diffusion Network, the ERIC Clearinghouse on the Handicapped and Gifted, and the Child and Adolescent Service Systems Program (CASSP) under the National Institute of Mental Health, appropriate parent and professional organizations, organizations representing individuals with disabilities, and such other networks as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Evaluation panels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall convene, in accordance with paragraph (2), panels of experts who are competent, by virtue of their training or experience, to evaluate proposals under section 1418 of this title and subchapters III through VII of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may use funds available under section 1418 of this title and subchapters III through VII of this chapter to pay expenses and fees of non-Federal members of the panels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Site visits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct at least 1 site visit for each grant, contract, and cooperative agreement receiving $300,000 or more annually under subchapters III through VII of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Discretionary program findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to the discretionary programs authorized by subchapters III through VII of this chapter, the Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The Federal Government must be responsive to the growing needs of an increasingly more diverse society. A more equitable allocation of resources is essential for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) America's racial profile is rapidly changing. While the rate of increase for white Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Hispanics, 14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1 percent for Asians and other ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) By the year 2000, this Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three of whom will be either African-American, Hispanic, or Asian-American.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Taken together as a group, it is a more frequent phenomenon for minorities to comprise the majority of public school students. Large city school populations are overwhelmingly minority, e.g., Miami, 71 percent; Philadelphia, 73 percent; Baltimore, 80 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Recruitment efforts within special education at the level of preservice, continuing education, and practice must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) The limited English proficient population is the fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in many parts of our Nation. In the Nation's 2 largest school districts, limited-English students make up almost half of all students initially entering school at the kindergarten level. Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the levels of referral and placement of limited-English proficient children in special education. The Department of Education has found that services provided to limited-English proficient students often do not respond primarily to the pupil's academic needs. These trends pose special challenges for special education in the referral, assessment, and services for our Nation's students from non-English language backgrounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the intensification of problems connected with <!-- PDFPage:692 -->mislabeling and high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) More minority children continue to be served in special education than would be expected from the percentage of minority students in the general school population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Poor African-American children are 3.5 times more likely to be identified by their teacher as mentally retarded than their white counterpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Although African-Americans represent 12 percent of elementary and secondary enrollments, they constitute 28 percent of total enrollments in special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) The drop out rate is 68 percent higher for minorities than for whites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) More than 50 percent of minority students in large cities drop out of school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) The opportunity for full participation in awards for grants and contracts; boards of organizations receiving funds under this chapter; and peer review panels; and training of professionals in the area of special education by minority individuals, organizations, and historically Black colleges and universities is essential if we are to obtain greater success in the education of minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) In 1989, of the 661,000 college and university professors, 4.6 percent were African-American and 3.1 percent were Hispanic. Of the 3,600,000 teachers, prekindergarten through high school, 9.4 percent were African-American and 3.9 percent were Hispanic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Students from minority groups comprise more than 50 percent of K  12 public school enrollment in seven States yet minority enrollment in teacher training programs is less than 15 percent in all but six States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) As the number of African-American and Hispanic students in special education increases, the number of minority teachers and related service personnel produced in our colleges and universities continues to decrease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Ten years ago, 12.5 percent of the United States teaching force in public elementary and secondary schools were members of a minority group. Minorities comprised 21.3 percent of the national population at that time and were clearly underrepresented then among employed teachers. Today, the elementary and secondary teaching force is 3 to 5 percent minority, while one-third of the students in public schools are minority children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) As recently as 1984  85, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) supplied nearly half of the African-American teachers in the Nation. However, in 1988, HBCUs received only 2 percent of the discretionary funds for special education and related services personnel training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) While African-American students constitute 28 percent of total enrollment in special education, only 11.2 percent of individuals enrolled in preservice training programs for special education are African-American.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) In 1986  87, of the degrees conferred in education at the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D levels, only 6, 8, and 8 percent, respectively, were awarded to African-American or Hispanic students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Minorities and underserved persons are socially disadvantaged because of the lack of opportunities in training and educational programs, undergirded by the practices in the private sector that impede their full participation in the mainstream of society.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress further finds that these conditions can be greatly improved by providing opportunities for the full participation of minorities through the implementation of the following recommendations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Implementation of a policy to mobilize the Nation's resources to prepare minorities for careers in special education and related services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) This policy should focus on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the recruitment of minorities into teaching; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) financially assisting HBCUs and other institutions of higher education (whose minority student enrollment is at least 25 percent) to prepare students for special education and related service careers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) The Secretary shall develop a plan for providing outreach services to the entities described in clause (ii) in order to increase the participation of such entities in competitions for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under any of subchapters III through VII of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The entities referred to in clause (i) are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions of higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 25 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) eligible institutions as defined in section 1058 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) nonprofit and for-profit agencies at least 51 percent owned or controlled by one or more minority individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) underrepresented populations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) For the purpose of implementing the plan required in clause (i), the Secretary shall, for each of the fiscal years 1991 through 1994, expend 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year involved for carrying out subchapters III through VII of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall exercise his/her utmost authority, resourcefulness, and diligence to meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Not later than January 31 of each year, starting with fiscal year 1991, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a final report on the progress toward meeting the goals of this subsection during the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a full explanation of any progress toward meeting the goals of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a plan to meet the goals, if necessary.</p>

Each such amended plan shall set forth in detail the policies and procedures which the State will undertake or has undertaken in order to assure that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) policies and procedures are established in accordance with detailed criteria prescribed under section 1417(c) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any amendment to the plan submitted by the State required by this section shall be available to parents, guardians, and other members of the general public at least thirty days prior to the date of submission of the amendment to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The State has established priorities for providing a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities, which priorities shall meet the timetables set forth in clause (B) of paragraph (2) of this section, first with respect to children with disabilities who are not receiving an education, and second with respect to children with disabilities, within each disability category, with the most severe disabilities who are receiving an inadequate education, and has made adequate progress in meeting the timetables set forth in clause (B) of paragraph (2) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under subsection (b) of this section who does not have the right to an appeal under subsection (c) of this section, and any party aggrieved by the findings and decision under subsection (c) of this section, shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented pursuant to this section, which action may be brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy. In any action brought under this paragraph the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency and the parents or guardian otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child, or, if applying for initial admission to a public school, shall, with the consent of the parents or guardian, be placed in the public school program until all such proceedings have been completed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purpose of this subsection, fees awarded under this subsection shall be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished. No bonus or multiplier may be used in calculating the fees awarded under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) No award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and related costs may be made in any action or proceeding under this subsection for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent or guardian, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the offer is not accepted within ten days; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the court or administrative officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the parents or guardian is not more favorable to the parents or guardian than the offer of settlement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (D), an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and related costs may be made to a parent or guardian who is the prevailing party and who was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Whenever the court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the parent or guardian, during the course of the action or proceeding, unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of the attorneys&rsquo; fees otherwise authorized to be awarded unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the time spent and legal services furnished were excessive considering the nature of the action or proceeding,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the court shall reduce, accordingly, the amount of the attorneys&rsquo; fees awarded under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) The provisions of subparagraph (F) shall not apply in any action or proceeding if the court finds that the State or local educational agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding or there was a violation of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect on other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 790 et seq.], or other Federal statutes protecting the rights of children and youth with disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter, the procedures under subsections (b)(2) and (c) of this section shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Failure to comply with this subchapter; limitations; public notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State educational agency involved (and to any local educational agency or intermediate educational unit affected by any failure described in clause (2)), finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that there has been a failure to comply substantially with any provision of section 1412 or section 1413 of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that in the administration of the State plan there is a failure to comply with any provision of this subchapter or with any requirements set forth in the application of a local educational agency or intermediate educational unit approved by the State educational agency pursuant to the State plan, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall, after notifying the State educational agency, withhold any further payments to the State under this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may, after notifying the State educational agency, withhold further payments to the State under the Federal programs specified in section 1413(a)(2) of this title within the Secretary's jurisdiction, to the extent that funds under such programs are available for the provision of assistance for the education of children with disabilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Secretary withholds further payments under clause (A) or clause (B) the Secretary may determine that such withholding will be limited to programs or projects under the State plan, or portions thereof, affected by the failure, or that the State educational agency shall not make further payments under this subchapter to specified local educational agencies or intermediate educational units affected by the failure. Until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any failure to comply with the provisions of this subchapter, as specified in clause (1) or clause (2), no further payments shall be made to the State under this subchapter or under the Federal programs specified in section 1413(a)(2) of this title within the Secretary's jurisdiction to the extent that funds under such programs are available for the provision of assistance for the education of children with disabilities, or payments by the State educational agency under this subchapter shall be limited to local educational agencies and intermediate educational units whose actions did not cause or were not involved in the failure, as the case may be. Any State educational agency, local educational agency, or intermediate educational unit in receipt of a notice pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection shall, by means of a public notice, take such measures as may be necessary to bring the pendency of an action pursuant to this subsection to the attention of the public within the jurisdiction of such agency or unit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If any State is dissatisfied with the Secretary's final action with respect to its State plan submitted under section 1413 of this title, such State may, within sixty days after notice of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of that action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings upon which the Secretary's action was based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive; but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that there is an urgent and substantial need&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities and to minimize their potential for developmental delay,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to minimize the likelihood of institutionalization of individuals with disabilities and maximize the potential for their independent living in society,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to enhance the capacity of State and local agencies and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs of historically underrepresented populations, particularly minority, low-income, inner-city, and rural populations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore the policy of the United States to provide financial assistance to States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency program of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to enhance their capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing early intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The timely administrative resolution of complaints by parents. Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision regarding an administrative complaint shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint, which action may be brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The right to confidentiality of personally identifiable information, including the right of parents or guardians to written notice of and written consent to the exchange of such information among agencies consistent with Federal and State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The right of the parents or guardian to determine whether they, their infant or toddler, or other family members will accept or decline any early intervention service under this subchapter in accordance with State law without jeopardizing other early intervention services under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The opportunity for parents or a guardian to examine records relating to assessment, screening, eligibility determinations, and the development and implementation of the individualized family service plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Procedures to protect the rights of the infant or toddler with a disability whenever the parents or guardian of the child are not known or unavailable or the child is a ward of the State, including the assignment of an individual (who shall not be an employee of the State agency providing services) to act as a surrogate for the parents or guardian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Written prior notice to the parents or guardian of the infant or toddler with a disability whenever the State agency or service provider proposes to initiate or change or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, placement, or the provision of appropriate early intervention services to the infant or toddler with a disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Procedures designed to assure that the notice required by paragraph (6) fully informs the parents or guardian, in the parents&rsquo; or guardian's native language, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, of all procedures available pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) During the pendency of any proceeding or action involving a complaint, unless the State agency and the parents or guardian otherwise agree, the child shall continue to receive the appropriate early intervention services currently being provided or, if applying for initial services, shall receive the services not in dispute.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Families of children with disabilities enrich the lives of all citizens through the contributions of such families to the economic, health, and social fabric of their community, State, and Nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A growing number of families are searching for ways to empower themselves to raise their children with disabilities at home and in their communities.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Most families of children with disabilities do not have access to family-centered and family-directed services to support such families in their efforts to care for their children with disabilities at home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) There is a need in each State for a comprehensive, coordinated, interagency system of family support for families of children with disabilities that is family-centered and family-directed, is easily accessible, avoids duplication, uses existing resources more efficiently, and prevents gaps in services to families in all areas of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The goals of the Nation properly include the goal of providing families of children with disabilities the family support necessary to accomplish the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) To support the family.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) To enable families of children with disabilities to nurture and enjoy their children at home.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) increase and promote interagency coordination among State agencies, and between State agencies and private entities that are involved in carrying out activities under section 1491g of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Family support for families of children with disabilities must focus on the needs of the entire family.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Families of children with disabilities should be supported in determining their needs and in making decisions concerning necessary, desirable, and appropriate services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Family needs change over time and family support for families of children with disabilities must offer options that are flexible and responsive to the unique needs and strengths and cultural values of individual families.</p>
