<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This chapter may be cited as the &ldquo;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to participate in or contribute to society. Improving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Before the date of the enactment of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94&ndash;142)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the special educational needs of children with disabilities were not being fully met;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more than one-half of the children with disabilities in the United States did not receive appropriate educational services that would enable such children to have full equality of opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) 1,000,000 of the children with disabilities in the United States were excluded entirely from the public school system and did not go through the educational process with their peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) there were many children with disabilities throughout the United States participating in regular school programs whose dis<!-- PDFPage:646 -->abilities prevented such children from having a successful educational experience because their disabilities were undetected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) because of the lack of adequate services within the public school system, families were often forced to find services outside the public school system, often at great distance from their residence and at their own expense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this chapter has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education and in improving educational results for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) However, the implementation of this chapter has been impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching and learning for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Over 20 years of research and experience has demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) having high expectations for such children and ensuring their access in the general curriculum to the maximum extent possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) strengthening the role of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) coordinating this chapter with other local, educational service agency, State, and Federal school improvement efforts in order to ensure that such children benefit from such efforts and that special education can become a service for such children rather than a place where they are sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) providing appropriate special education and related services and aids and supports in the regular classroom to such children, whenever appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) supporting high-quality, intensive professional development for all personnel who work with such children in order to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to enable them&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to meet developmental goals and, to the maximum extent possible, those challenging expectations that have been established for all children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to be prepared to lead productive, independent, adult lives, to the maximum extent possible;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) providing incentives for whole-school approaches and pre-referral intervention to reduce the need to label children as disabled in order to address their learning needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) focusing resources on teaching and learning while reducing paperwork and requirements that do not assist in improving educational results.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) While States, local educational agencies, and educational service agencies are responsible for providing an education for all children with disabilities, it is in the national interest that the Federal Government have a role in assisting State and local efforts to educate children with disabilities in order to improve results for such children and to ensure equal protection of the law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the growing needs of an increasingly more diverse society. A more equitable allocation of resources is essential for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) America's racial profile is rapidly changing. Between 1980 and 1990, the rate of increase in the population for white Americans was 6 percent, while the rate of increase for racial and ethnic minorities was much higher: 53 percent for Hispanics, 13.2 percent for African-Americans, and 107.8 percent for Asians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) By the year 2000, this Nation will have 275,000,000 people, nearly one of every three of whom will be either African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American, or American Indian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Taken together as a group, minority children are comprising an ever larger percentage of public school students. Large-city school populations are overwhelmingly minority, for example: for fall 1993, the figure for Miami was 84 percent; Chicago, 89 percent; Philadelphia, 78 percent; Baltimore, 84 percent; Houston, 88 percent; and Los Angeles, 88 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Recruitment efforts within special education must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The limited English proficient population is the fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in many parts of our Nation. In the Nation's 2 largest school districts, limited English proficient students make up almost half of all students initially entering school at the kindergarten level. Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the levels of referral and placement of limited English proficient children in special education. The Department of Education has found that services provided to limited English proficient students often do not respond primarily to the pupil's academic needs. These trends pose special challenges for special education in the referral, assessment, and services for our Nation's students from non-English language backgrounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) More minority children continue to be served in special education than would be expected from the percentage of minority students in the general school population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Poor African-American children are 2.3 times more likely to be identified by their teacher as having mental retardation than their white counterpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Although African-Americans represent 16 percent of elementary and secondary enroll<!-- PDFPage:647 -->ments, they constitute 21 percent of total enrollments in special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The drop-out rate is 68 percent higher for minorities than for whites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) More than 50 percent of minority students in large cities drop out of school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9)(A) The opportunity for full participation in awards for grants and contracts; boards of organizations receiving funds under this chapter; and peer review panels; and training of professionals in the area of special education by minority individuals, organizations, and historically black colleges and universities is essential if we are to obtain greater success in the education of minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In 1993, of the 915,000 college and university professors, 4.9 percent were African-American and 2.4 percent were Hispanic. Of the 2,940,000 teachers, prekindergarten through high school, 6.8 percent were African-American and 4.1 percent were Hispanic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Students from minority groups comprise more than 50 percent of K&ndash;12 public school enrollment in seven States yet minority enrollment in teacher training programs is less than 15 percent in all but six States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) As the number of African-American and Hispanic students in special education increases, the number of minority teachers and related service personnel produced in our colleges and universities continues to decrease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Ten years ago, 12 percent of the United States teaching force in public elementary and secondary schools were members of a minority group. Minorities comprised 21 percent of the national population at that time and were clearly underrepresented then among employed teachers. Today, the elementary and secondary teaching force is 13 percent minority, while one-third of the students in public schools are minority children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) As recently as 1991, historically black colleges and universities enrolled 44 percent of the African-American teacher trainees in the Nation. However, in 1993, historically black colleges and universities received only 4 percent of the discretionary funds for special education and related services personnel training under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) While African-American students constitute 28 percent of total enrollment in special education, only 11.2 percent of individuals enrolled in preservice training programs for special education are African-American.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) In 1986&ndash;87, of the degrees conferred in education at the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. levels, only 6, 8, and 8 percent, respectively, were awarded to African-American or Hispanic students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Minorities and underserved persons are socially disadvantaged because of the lack of opportunities in training and educational programs, undergirded by the practices in the private sector that impede their full participation in the mainstream of society.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to assist States, localities, educational service agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education of all children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist States in the implementation of a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ensure that educators and parents have the necessary tools to improve educational results for children with disabilities by supporting systemic-change activities; coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and technology development and media services; and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State is eligible for assistance under this subchapter for a fiscal year if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets each of the following conditions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Free appropriate public education</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities residing in the State between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The obligation to make a free appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities does not apply with respect to children:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) aged 3 through 5 and 18 through 21 in a State to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, respecting the provision of public education to children in those age ranges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) aged 18 through 21 to the extent that State law does not require that special education and related services under this subchapter be provided to children with disabilities who, in the educational placement prior to their incarceration in an adult correctional facility:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) were not actually identified as being a child with a disability under section 1401(3) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) did not have an individualized education program under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Full educational opportunity goal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State has established a goal of providing full educational opportunity to all children with disabilities and a detailed timetable for accomplishing that goal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Child find</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All children with disabilities residing in the State, including children with disabilities attending private schools, regardless of the severity of their disabilities, and who are in need of special education and related services, are identified, located, and evaluated and a practical method is developed and implemented to determine which children with disabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this chapter requires that children be classified by their disability so long as each child who has a disability listed in section 1401 of this title and who, by reason of that disability, needs special education and related services is regarded as a child with a disability under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Individualized education program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individualized education program, or an individualized family service plan that meets the requirements of section 1436(d) of this title, is developed, reviewed, and revised for each child with a disability in accordance with section 1414(d) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Least restrictive environment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional requirement</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A local educational agency is eligible for assistance under this subchapter for a fiscal year if such agency demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State educational agency that it meets each of the following conditions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Consistency with State policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agency, in providing for the education of children with disabilities within its jurisdiction, has in effect policies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with the State policies and procedures established under section 1412 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of amounts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Amounts provided to the local educational agency under this subchapter shall be expended in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subchapter and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be used only to pay the excess costs of providing special education and related services to children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be used to supplement State, local, and other Federal funds and not to supplant such funds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not be used, except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), to reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with disabilities made by the local educational agency from local funds below the level of those expenditures for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the restriction in subparagraph (A)(iii), a local educational agency may reduce the level of expenditures where such reduction is attributable to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with this subchapter, to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the State educational agency, because the child&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) has left the jurisdiction of the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide a free appropriate public education to the child has terminated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) no longer needs such program of special education; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as the acquisition of equipment or the construction of school facilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if a State educational agency determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the requirements of this subchapter, the State educational agency may prohibit the local <!-- PDFPage:668 -->educational agency from treating funds received under this subchapter as local funds under clause (i) for any fiscal year, only if it is authorized to do so by the State constitution or a State statute.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Schoolwide programs under title I of the ESEA</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) the amount received by the local educational agency under this subchapter for that fiscal year; divided by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the number of children with disabilities in the jurisdiction of that agency.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Services and aids that also benefit nondisabled children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the costs of special education and related services and supplementary aids and services provided in a regular class or other education-related setting to a child with a disability in accordance with the individualized education program of the child, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from such services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides funds under this subchapter to those schools in the same manner as it provides those funds to its other schools.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that there has been a failure by the State to comply substantially with any provision of this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that there is a failure to comply with any condition of a local educational agency's or State agency's eligibility under this subchapter, including the terms of any agreement to achieve compliance with this subchapter within the timelines specified in the agreement;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary shall, after notifying the State educational agency, withhold, in whole or in part, any further payments to the State under this subchapter, or refer the matter for appropriate enforcement action, which may include referral to the Department of Justice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nature of withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary withholds further payments under paragraph (1), the Secretary may determine that such withholding will be limited to programs or projects, or portions thereof, affected by the failure, or that the State educational agency shall not make further payments under this subchapter to specified local educational agencies or State agencies affected by the failure. Until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any failure to comply with the provisions of this subchapter, as specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), payments to the State under this subchapter shall be withheld in whole or in part, or payments by the State educational agency under this subchapter shall be limited to local educational agencies and State agencies whose actions did not cause or were not involved in the failure, as the case may be. Any State educational agency, State agency, or local educational agency that has received notice under paragraph (1) shall, by means of a public notice, take such measures as may be necessary to bring the pendency of an action pursuant to this subsection to the attention of the public within the jurisdiction of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any State is dissatisfied with the Secretary's final action with respect to the eligibility of the State under section 1412 of this title, such State may, not later than 60 days after notice of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of that action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings upon which the Secretary's action was based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:683 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction; review by United States Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Standard of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary's previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Divided State agency responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, where responsibility for ensuring that the requirements of this subchapter are met with respect to children with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons is assigned to a public agency other than the State educational agency pursuant to section 1412(a)(11)(C) of this title, the Secretary, in instances where the Secretary finds that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of this subchapter are related to a failure by the public agency, shall take appropriate corrective action to ensure compliance with this subchapter, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any reduction or withholding of payments to the State is proportionate to the total funds allotted under section 1411 of this title to the State as the number of eligible children with disabilities in adult prisons under the supervision of the other public agency is proportionate to the number of eligible individuals with disabilities in the State under the supervision of the State educational agency; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that there is an urgent and substantial need&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities and to minimize their potential for developmental delay;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to minimize the likelihood of institutionalization of individuals with disabilities and maximize the potential for their independently living in society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to enhance the capacity of State and local agencies and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs of historically underrepresented populations, particularly minority, low-income, inner-city, and rural populations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore the policy of the United States to provide financial assistance to States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system that provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to enhance their capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing early intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to encourage States to expand opportunities for children under 3 years of age who would be at risk of having substantial developmental delay if they did not receive early intervention services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Written prior notice to the parents of the infant or toddler with a disability whenever the State agency or service provider proposes to initiate or change or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or placement of the infant or toddler with a disability, or the provision of appropriate early intervention services to the infant or toddler.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Procedures designed to ensure that the notice required by paragraph (6) fully informs the parents, in the parents&rsquo; native language, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, of all procedures available pursuant to this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) States are responding with some success to multiple pressures to improve educational and transitional services and results for children with disabilities in response to growing demands imposed by ever-changing factors, such as demographics, social policies, and labor and economic markets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In order for States to address such demands and to facilitate lasting systemic change that is of benefit to all students, including children with disabilities, States must involve local educational agencies, parents, individuals with disabilities and their families, teachers and other service providers, and other interested individuals and organizations in carrying out comprehensive strategies to improve educational results for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Targeted Federal financial resources are needed to assist States, working in partner<!-- PDFPage:699 -->ship with others, to identify and make needed changes to address the needs of children with disabilities into the next century.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) State educational agencies, in partnership with local educational agencies and other individuals and organizations, are in the best position to identify and design ways to meet emerging and expanding demands to improve education for children with disabilities and to address their special needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Research, demonstration, and practice over the past 20 years in special education and related disciplines have built a foundation of knowledge on which State and local systemic-change activities can now be based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Such research, demonstration, and practice in special education and related disciplines have demonstrated that an effective educational system now and in the future must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) maintain high academic standards and clear performance goals for children with disabilities, consistent with the standards and expectations for all students in the educational system, and provide for appropriate and effective strategies and methods to ensure that students who are children with disabilities have maximum opportunities to achieve those standards and goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) create a system that fully addresses the needs of all students, including children with disabilities, by addressing the needs of children with disabilities in carrying out educational reform activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) clearly define, in measurable terms, the school and post-school results that children with disabilities are expected to achieve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) promote service integration, and the coordination of State and local education, social, health, mental health, and other services, in addressing the full range of student needs, particularly the needs of children with disabilities who require significant levels of support to maximize their participation and learning in school and the community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) ensure that children with disabilities are provided assistance and support in making transitions as described in section 1474(b)(3)(C) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) promote comprehensive programs of professional development to ensure that the persons responsible for the education or a transition of children with disabilities possess the skills and knowledge necessary to address the educational and related needs of those children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) disseminate to teachers and other personnel serving children with disabilities research-based knowledge about successful teaching practices and models and provide technical assistance to local educational agencies and schools on how to improve results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) create school-based disciplinary strategies that will be used to reduce or eliminate the need to use suspension and expulsion as disciplinary options for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) establish placement-neutral funding formulas and cost-effective strategies for meeting the needs of children with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) involve individuals with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities in planning, implementing, and evaluating systemic-change activities and educational reforms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this part is to assist State educational agencies, and their partners referred to in section 1452(b) of this title, in reforming and improving their systems for providing educational, early intervention, and transitional services, including their systems for professional development, technical assistance, and dissemination of knowledge about best practices, to improve results for children with disabilities.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Federal Government has an ongoing obligation to support programs, projects, and activities that contribute to positive results for children with disabilities, enabling them&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to meet their early intervention, educational, and transitional goals and, to the maximum extent possible, educational standards that have been established for all children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to acquire the skills that will empower them to lead productive and independent adult lives.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) As a result of more than 20 years of Federal support for research, demonstration projects, and personnel preparation, there is an important knowledge base for improving results for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such knowledge should be used by States and local educational agencies to design and implement state-of-the-art educational systems that consider the needs of, and include, children with disabilities, especially in environments in which they can learn along with their peers and achieve results measured by the same standards as the results of their peers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Continued Federal support is essential for the development and maintenance of a coordinated and high-quality program of research, demonstration projects, dissemination of information, and personnel preparation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Parent training and information activities have taken on increased importance in efforts to assist parents of a child with a disability in dealing with the multiple pressures of rearing such a child and are of particular importance in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensuring the involvement of such parents in planning and decisionmaking with respect to early intervention, educational, and transitional services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) achieving quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) providing such parents information on their rights and protections under this chapter to ensure improved early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) assisting such parents in the development of skills to participate effectively in the education and development of their children and in the transitions described in section 1474(b)(3)(C) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) supporting the roles of such parents as participants within partnerships seeking to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Providers of parent training and information activities need to ensure that such parents who have limited access to services and supports, due to economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers, are provided with access to appropriate parent training and information activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Parents of children with disabilities need information that helps the parents to understand the rights and responsibilities of their children under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The provision of coordinated technical assistance and dissemination of information to State and local agencies, institutions of higher education, and other providers of services to children with disabilities is essential in&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal support for carrying out technology research, technology development, and educational media services and activities has resulted in major innovations that have significantly improved early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Such Federal support is needed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to stimulate the development of software, interactive learning tools, and devices to address early intervention, educational, and transitional needs of children with disabilities who have certain disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to make information available on technology research, technology development, and educational media services and activities to individuals involved in the provision of early intervention, educational, and transitional services to children with disabilities;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:714 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to promote the integration of technology into curricula to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
