<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This chapter may be cited as the &ldquo;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to participate in or contribute to society. Improving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Before the date of enactment of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94&ndash;142), the educational needs of millions of children with disabilities were not being fully met because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the children did not receive appropriate educational services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the children were excluded entirely from the public school system and from being educated with their peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the children from having a successful educational experience; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a lack of adequate resources within the public school system forced families to find services outside the public school system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this chapter has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education and in improving educational results for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) However, the implementation of this chapter has been impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching and learning for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Almost 30 years of research and experience has demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) having high expectations for such children and ensuring their access to the general education curriculum in the regular classroom, to the maximum extent possible, in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) meet developmental goals and, to the maximum extent possible, the challenging expectations that have been established for all children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) be prepared to lead productive and independent adult lives, to the maximum extent possible;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) coordinating this chapter with other local, educational service agency, State, and Federal school improvement efforts, including improvement efforts under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.], in order to ensure that such children benefit from such efforts and that special education can become a service for such children rather than a place where such children are sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) providing appropriate special education and related services, and aids and supports in the regular classroom, to such children, whenever appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) supporting high-quality, intensive preservice preparation and professional development for all personnel who work with children with disabilities in order to ensure that such personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary to improve the academic achievement and functional performance of children with disabilities, including the use of scientifically based instructional practices, to the maximum extent possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) providing incentives for whole-school approaches, scientifically based early reading programs, positive behavioral interventions and supports, and early intervening services to reduce the need to label children as disabled in order to address the learning and behavioral needs of such children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) focusing resources on teaching and learning while reducing paperwork and requirements that do not assist in improving educational results; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) supporting the development and use of technology, including assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, to maximize accessibility for children with disabilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) While States, local educational agencies, and educational service agencies are primarily responsible for providing an education for all children with disabilities, it is in the national interest that the Federal Government have a supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to educate children with disabilities in order to improve results for such children and to ensure equal protection of the law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A more equitable allocation of resources is essential for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Parents and schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and constructive ways.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:851 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Teachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational outcomes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the growing needs of an increasingly diverse society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) America's ethnic profile is rapidly changing. In 2000, 1 of every 3 persons in the United States was a member of a minority group or was limited English proficient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Minority children comprise an increasing percentage of public school students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) With such changing demographics, recruitment efforts for special education personnel should focus on increasing the participation of minorities in the teaching profession in order to provide appropriate role models with sufficient knowledge to address the special education needs of these students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11)(A) The limited English proficient population is the fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in many parts of our Nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the levels of referral and placement of limited English proficient children in special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Such discrepancies pose a special challenge for special education in the referral of, assessment of, and provision of services for, our Nation's students from non-English language backgrounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) More minority children continue to be served in special education than would be expected from the percentage of minority students in the general school population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) African-American children are identified as having intellectual disabilities and emotional disturbance at rates greater than their White counterparts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) In the 1998&ndash;1999 school year, African-American children represented just 14.8 percent of the population aged 6 through 21, but comprised 20.2 percent of all children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Studies have found that schools with predominately White students and teachers have placed disproportionately high numbers of their minority students into special education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13)(A) As the number of minority students in special education increases, the number of minority teachers and related services personnel produced in colleges and universities continues to decrease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The opportunity for full participation by minority individuals, minority organizations, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities in awards for grants and contracts, boards of organizations receiving assistance under this chapter, peer review panels, and training of professionals in the area of special education is essential to obtain greater success in the education of minority children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) As the graduation rates for children with disabilities continue to climb, providing effective transition services to promote successful post-school employment or education is an important measure of accountability for children with disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to assist States, localities, educational service agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education of all children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist States in the implementation of a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ensure that educators and parents have the necessary tools to improve educational results for children with disabilities by supporting system improvement activities; coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and technology development and media services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to assess, and ensure the effectiveness of, efforts to educate children with disabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) aged 3 through 5 and 18 through 21 in a State to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, respecting the provision of public education to children in those age ranges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) aged 18 through 21 to the extent that State law does not require that special education and related services under this subchapter be provided to children with disabilities who, in the educational placement prior to their incarceration in an adult correctional facility&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) were not actually identified as being a child with a disability under section 1401 of this title; or</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) State flexibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State that provides early intervention services in accordance with subchapter III to a child who is eligible for services under section 1419 of this title, is not required to provide such child with a free appropriate public education.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this chapter requires that children be classified by their disability so long as each child who has a disability listed in section 1401 of this title and who, by reason of that disability, needs special education and related services is regarded as a child with a disability under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Individualized education program</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional requirement</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A State funding mechanism shall not result in placements that violate the requirements of subparagraph (A), and a State shall not use a funding mechanism by which the State distributes funds on the basis of the type of setting in which a child is served that will result in the failure to provide a child with a disability a free appropriate public education according to the unique needs of the child as described in the child's IEP.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Assurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the State does not have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with clause (i), the State shall provide the Secretary an assurance that the State will revise the funding mechanism as soon as feasible to ensure that such mechanism does not result in such placements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Procedural safeguards</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional procedural safeguards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Procedures to ensure that testing and evaluation materials and procedures utilized for the purposes of evaluation and placement of children with disabilities for services under this chapter will be selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory. Such materials or procedures shall be provided and administered in the child's native language or mode of communication, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, and no single procedure shall be the sole criterion for determining an appropriate educational program for a child.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:870 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Evaluation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) In calculating the proportionate amount of Federal funds, the local educational agency, after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of private schools as described in clause (iii), shall conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of parentally placed children with disabilities attending private schools located in the local educational agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) Such services to parentally placed private school children with disabilities may be provided to the children on the premises of private, including religious, schools, to the extent consistent with law.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Consistency with State policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agency, in providing for the education of children with disabilities within its jurisdiction, has in effect policies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with the State policies and procedures established under section 1412 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of amounts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the restriction in subparagraph (A)(iii), a local educational agency may reduce the level of expenditures where such reduction is attributable to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with this subchapter, to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the State educational agency, because the child&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the number of children with disabilities in the jurisdiction of that agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that there is an urgent and substantial need&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities, to minimize their potential for developmental delay, and to recognize the significant brain development that occurs during a child's first 3 years of life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to maximize the potential for individuals with disabilities to live independently in society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to enhance the capacity of State and local agencies and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs of all children, particularly minority, low-income, inner <!-- PDFPage:908 -->city, and rural children, and infants and toddlers in foster care.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States to provide financial assistance to States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system that provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to enhance State capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing early intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to encourage States to expand opportunities for children under 3 years of age who would be at risk of having substantial developmental delay if they did not receive early intervention services.</p>

The amount of such payment for any fiscal year shall be 1.25 percent of the aggregate of the amount available to all States under this subchapter for such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Interior shall distribute the entire payment received under paragraph (1) by providing to each tribe, tribal organization, or consortium an amount based on the number of infants and toddlers residing on the reservation, as determined annually, divided by the total of such children served by all tribes, tribal organizations, or consortia.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To receive a payment under this subsection, the tribe, tribal organization, or consortium shall submit such information to the Secretary of the Interior as is needed to determine the amounts to be distributed under paragraph (2).</p>

Such activities may be carried out directly or through contracts or cooperative agreements with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, local educational agencies, and other public or private nonprofit organizations. The tribe, tribal organization, or consortium is encouraged to involve Indian parents in the development and implementation of these activities.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) $500,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Ratable reduction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the sums made available under this subchapter for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that all States are eligible to receive under this subsection for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce the allotments to such States for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If additional funds become available for making payments under this subsection for a fiscal year, allotments that were reduced under subparagraph (A) shall be increased on the same basis the allotments were reduced.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Federal Government has an ongoing obligation to support activities that contribute to positive results for children with disabilities, enabling those children to lead productive and independent adult lives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Systemic change benefiting all students, including children with disabilities, requires the involvement of States, local educational agencies, parents, individuals with disabilities and their families, teachers and other service providers, and other interested individuals and organizations to develop and implement comprehensive strategies that improve educational results for children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) State educational agencies, in partnership with local educational agencies, parents of children with disabilities, and other individuals and organizations, are in the best position to improve education for children with disabilities and to address their special needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) An effective educational system serving students with disabilities should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) maintain high academic achievement standards and clear performance goals for children with disabilities, consistent with the standards and expectations for all students in the educational system, and provide for appropriate and effective strategies and methods to ensure that all children with disabilities have the opportunity to achieve those standards and goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) clearly define, in objective, measurable terms, the school and post-school results that children with disabilities are expected to achieve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promote transition services and coordinate State and local education, social, health, mental health, and other services, in addressing the full range of student needs, particularly the needs of children with disabilities who need significant levels of support to participate and learn in school and the community.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The availability of an adequate number of qualified personnel is critical&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to serve effectively children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to assume leadership positions in administration and direct services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to provide teacher training; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to conduct high quality research to improve special education.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) High quality, comprehensive professional development programs are essential to ensure that the persons responsible for the education or transition of children with disabilities possess the skills and knowledge necessary to address the educational and related needs of those children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Models of professional development should be scientifically based and reflect successful practices, including strategies for recruiting, preparing, and retaining personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Continued support is essential for the development and maintenance of a coordinated and high quality program of research to inform successful teaching practices and model curricula for educating children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Training, technical assistance, support, and dissemination activities are necessary to ensure that subchapters II and III are fully implemented and achieve high quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Parents, teachers, administrators, and related services personnel need technical assistance and information in a timely, coordinated, and accessible manner in order to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results at the State and local levels for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Parent training and information activities assist parents of a child with a disability in dealing with the multiple pressures of parenting such a child and are of particular importance in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) playing a vital role in creating and preserving constructive relationships between parents of children with disabilities and schools by facilitating open communication between the parents and schools; encouraging dispute resolution at the earliest possible point in time; and discouraging the escalation of an adversarial process between the parents and schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ensuring the involvement of parents in planning and decisionmaking with respect to early intervention, educational, and transitional services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) achieving high quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) providing such parents information on their rights, protections, and responsibilities under this chapter to ensure improved early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) assisting such parents in the development of skills to participate effectively in the education and development of their children and in the transitions described in section 1473(b)(6) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) supporting the roles of such parents as participants within partnerships seeking to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) supporting such parents who may have limited access to services and supports, due to economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Support is needed to improve technological resources and integrate technology, including universally designed technologies, into the lives of children with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, school per<!-- PDFPage:921 -->sonnel, and others through curricula, services, and assistive technologies.</p>
