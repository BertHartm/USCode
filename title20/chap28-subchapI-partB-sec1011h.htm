<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;Collegiate Initiative To Reduce Binge Drinking and Illegal Alcohol Consumption&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that, in an effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on college campuses, all institutions of higher education should carry out the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The president of the institution should appoint a task force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students, Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full examination of student and academic life at the institution. The task force should make recommendations for a broad range of policy and program changes that would serve to reduce alcohol and other drug-related problems. The institution should provide resources to assist the task force in promoting the campus policies and proposed environmental changes that have been identified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The institution should enforce a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by students at the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The institution should vigorously enforce the institution's code of disciplinary sanctions for those who violate campus alcohol policies. Students with alcohol or other drug-related problems should be referred for assistance, including on-campus counseling programs if appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The institution should adopt a policy to discourage alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus activities. It should adopt policies limiting the advertisement and promotion of alcoholic beverages on campus.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:182 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The institution should work with the local community, including local businesses, in a &ldquo;Town/Gown&rdquo; alliance to encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and to address illegal alcohol use by students.</p>
