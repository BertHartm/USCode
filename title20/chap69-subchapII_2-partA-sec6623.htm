<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title; findings; definitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;National Teacher Training Project Act of 1994&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) teachers must be major players in educational reform in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) teachers are isolated from their peers and have virtually no time during the school day to consult with other teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) there is a shortage of sustained, year-round professional development programs for teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) successful teaching methods are not adequately shared among teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) teachers are the best teachers of other teachers because practicing classroom teachers have experience that no outside consultant can match;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) it is important for universities and schools to collaborate on teacher development programs if teaching and learning are to be improved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) pertinent research is not shared among teachers in a professional setting;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) exemplary teachers should be recognized for their abilities and contributions and encouraged to refine their teaching methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) each State should support a nationally based teacher training program, that is modeled after the National Writing Project, for teachers of early childhood education, and for teachers of core academic subjects including teachers of mathematics, science, English, civics and government, foreign languages, and arts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) the National Writing Project is a nationally recognized and honored nonprofit organization that recognizes there are teachers in every region of the United States who have developed successful methods for teaching writing and that such teachers can be trained and encouraged to train other teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) the National Writing Project is a collaborative university-school program which offers summer and school year inservice teacher training programs and a dissemination network to inform and teach teachers regarding developments in the field of writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) each year, over 125,000 teachers voluntarily seek training in National Writing Project intensive summer institutes and workshops and school year inservice programs through one of the 155 sites located within the United States, and in 18 sites located outside of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(M) in the 20 years of its existence, over 1,100,000 teachers, administrators, and parents have participated in National Writing Project programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(N) less than $16 per teacher was the average cost in Federal dollars for all teacher training at writing projects in academic year 1991&ndash;1992;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(O) for every dollar in Federal support, the National Writing Project provides over $5 in matching funds from States, local universities and schools, and the private sector;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(P) private foundation resources, although generous in the past concerning National Writing Project programs, are inadequate to fund all of the National Teacher Training Project sites needed, and the future of the program is in jeopardy without secure financial support;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1181 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(Q) the National Writing Project has become a model for programs in other fields, such as science, mathematics, history, literature, foreign languages, and the performing arts, and the development of programs in other fields should continue with the support of Federal funds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(R) each of the 50 States should participate in the National Teacher Training Project by establishing regional teacher training sites in early childhood development, mathematics, science, English, civics and government, foreign languages, and arts to serve all teachers within the State.</p>
