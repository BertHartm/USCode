<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Waivers and modifications</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to this <!-- PDFPage:653 -->section, the Secretary of Education (referred to in this part as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs under title IV of the Act [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency to provide the waivers or modifications authorized by paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Actions authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary is authorized to waive or modify any provision described in paragraph (1) as may be necessary to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) recipients of student financial assistance under title IV of the Act who are affected individuals are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance because of their status as affected individuals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) administrative requirements placed on affected individuals who are recipients of student financial assistance are minimized, to the extent possible without impairing the integrity of the student financial assistance programs, to ease the burden on such students and avoid inadvertent, technical violations or defaults;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the calculation of &ldquo;annual adjusted family income&rdquo; and &ldquo;available income&rdquo;, as used in the determination of need for student financial assistance under title IV of the Act for any such affected individual (and the determination of such need for his or her spouse and dependents, if applicable), may be modified to mean the sums received in the first calendar year of the award year for which such determination is made, in order to reflect more accurately the financial condition of such affected individual and his or her family;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the calculation under section 484B(b)(2) of the Act (20 U.S.C. 1091b(b)(2)) of the amount a student is required to return in the case of an affected individual may be modified so that no overpayment will be required to be returned or repaid if the institution has documented (i) the student's status as an affected individual in the student's file, and (ii) the amount of any overpayment discharged; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) institutions of higher education, eligible lenders, guaranty agencies, and other entities participating in the student assistance programs under title IV of the Act that are located in areas that are declared disaster areas by any Federal, State or local official in connection with a national emergency, or whose operations are significantly affected by such a disaster, may be granted temporary relief from requirements that are rendered infeasible or unreasonable by a national emergency, including due diligence requirements and reporting deadlines.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice of waivers or modifications</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1232 of this title and section 553 of title 5, the Secretary shall, by notice in the Federal Register, publish the waivers or modifications of statutory and regulatory provisions the Secretary deems necessary to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notice under paragraph (1) shall include the terms and conditions to be applied in lieu of such statutory and regulatory provisions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Case-by-case basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary is not required to exercise the waiver or modification authority under this section on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Impact report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, not later than 15 months after first exercising any authority to issue a waiver or modification under subsection (a), report to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate on the impact of any waivers or modifications issued pursuant to subsection (a) on affected individuals and the programs under title IV of the Act [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.], and the basis for such determination, and include in such report the Secretary's recommendations for changes to the statutory or regulatory provisions that were the subject of such waiver or modification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) No delay in waivers and modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Sections 482(c) and 492 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1089(c), 1098a) shall not apply to the waivers and modifications authorized or required by this part.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:654 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if affected individuals withdraw from a course of study as a result of such active duty or active service, such institutions should make every effort to minimize deferral of enrollment or reapplication requirements and should provide the greatest flexibility possible with administrative deadlines related to those applications.</p>
