<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Subjects of Study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In performing the study, the Advisory Committee shall, at a minimum, examine the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) whether the methodology used to calculate the expected family contribution can be simplified without significant adverse effects on program intent, costs, integrity, delivery, and distribution of awards;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) whether the number of data elements, and, accordingly, the number and complexity of questions asked of students and families, used to calculate the expected family contribution can be reduced without such adverse effects;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) whether the procedures for determining such data elements, including determining and updating offsets and allowances, is the most efficient, effective, and fair means to determine a family's available income and assets;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) whether the methodology used to calculate the expected family contribution, specifically the consideration of income earned by a dependent student and its effect on Pell grant eligibility, is an effective and fair means to determine a family's available income and a student's need;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) whether the nature and timing of the application required in section 483 (a)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1090(a)(1)), eligibility and award determination, financial aid processing, and funds delivery can be streamlined further for students and families, institutions, and States;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) whether a widely disseminated printed form, or the use of an Internet or other electronic means, can be developed to notify individuals of an estimation of their approximate eligibility for grant, work-study, and loan assistance upon completion and verification of the simplified application form;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) whether information provided on other Federal forms (such as the form applying for supplemental security income under title XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.], the form for applying for food stamps under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 [7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], and the schedule for applying for the earned income tax credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 32]) that are designed to determine eligibility for various Federal need-based assistance programs could be used to qualify potential students for the simplified needs test; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) whether any proposed changes to data elements collected, in addition to those used to calculate expected family contribution, or any proposed changes to the form's design or the process of applying for aid, may have adverse effects on program costs, integrity, delivery, or distribution of awards, as well as, application development or application processing.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Additional Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In conducting the feasibility study, the Advisory Committee's primary objective under this subsection shall be simplifying the financial aid application forms and process and obtaining a substantial reduction in the number of required data items.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Forms design expert</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With the goal of making significant changes to the form to make the questions more easily understandable, the Advisory Committee shall consult a forms design expert to ensure that its recommendations for revision of the application form would assist in making the form easily readable and understood by parents, students, and other members of the public.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Congressional consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Advisory Committee shall consult on a regular basis with the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate in carrying out the feasibility study required by this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Departmental consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Education shall provide such assistance to the Advisory Committee as is requested and practicable in conducting the study required by this subsection.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Final report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Advisory Committee shall, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, prepare and submit a full final report on the study, including recommendations for regulatory and administrative changes required by this section, to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, and the Secretary of Education.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) <cap-smallcap>Implementation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Education shall consult with the Committee on Education and the <!-- PDFPage:451 -->Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and shall subsequently initiate a redesign of the form required by section 483 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1090). Such redesign shall include the testing of alternative simplified versions of the free Federal form.

Such revised table shall be developed by increasing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table in each such section by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 1992 and the December next preceding the beginning of such academic year, and rounding the result to the nearest $10.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1087tt. Discretion of student financial aid administrators</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances. However, this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special circumstances may include tuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school, medical or dental expenses not covered by insurance, unusually high child care costs, recent unemployment of a family member, the number of parents enrolled at least half-time in a degree, certificate, or other program leading to a recognized educational credential at an institution with a program participation agreement under section 1094 of this title, or other changes in a family's income, a family's assets, or a student's status. Special circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student financial aid administrator in such cases to request and use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting, processing, or delivering such supplementary information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to assets taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in accordance with subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy or an involuntary liquidation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the administrator makes adjustments in the award level of a student with a disability so as to take into consideration the additional costs such student incurs as a result of such student's disability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Refusal or adjustment of loan certifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On a case-by-case basis, an eligible institution may refuse to certify a statement that permits a student to receive a loan under part B or C of this subchapter, or may certify a loan amount or make a loan that is less than the student's determination of need (as determined under this part), if the reason for the action is documented and provided in written form to the student. No eligible institution shall discriminate against any borrower or applicant in obtaining a loan on the basis of race, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, age, or disability status.</p>
