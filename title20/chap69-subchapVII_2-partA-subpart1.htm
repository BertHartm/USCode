<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in designing the program for which application is made, the needs of children in nonprofit private elementary and secondary schools have been taken into account through consultation with appropriate private school officials and, consistent with the number of such children enrolled in such schools in the area to be served whose educational needs are of the type and whose language and grade levels are of a similar type to those which the program is intended to address, after consultation with appropriate private school officials, provision has been made for the participation of such children on a basis comparable to that provided for public school children;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Federal funds made available for the project or activity will be used so as to supplement the level of State and local funds that, in the absence of such Federal funds, would have been expended for special programs for children of limited English proficient individuals and in no case to supplant such State and local funds, except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to preclude a local educational agency from using funds under this subchapter for activities carried out under an order of a court of the United States or of any State respecting services to be provided such children, or to carry out a plan approved by the Secretary as adequate under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.] with respect to services to be provided such children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the assistance provided under the application will contribute toward building the capacity of the applicant to provide a program on a regular basis, similar to that proposed for assistance, which will be of sufficient size, scope, and quality to promise significant improvement in the education of students of limited-English proficiency, and that the applicant will have the resources and commitment to continue the program when assistance under this subpart is reduced or no longer available; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the applicant provides for utilization of the State and national dissemination sources for program design and in dissemination of results and products.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the Secretary may award grants under this subpart for special alternative instructional programs if an applicant has demonstrated that the applicant cannot develop and implement a bilingual education program for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Where the diversity of the limited English proficient students&rsquo; native languages and the small number of students speaking each respective language makes bilingual education impractical.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Where, despite documented efforts, the applicant has not been able to hire qualified instructional personnel who are able to communicate in the students&rsquo; native language.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In approving applications under this subpart, the Secretary shall give consideration to the degree to which the program for which assistance is sought involves the collaborative efforts of institutions of higher education, community-based organizations, the appropriate local and State educational agency, or businesses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Due consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall give due consideration to applications providing training for personnel participating in or preparing to participate in the program which will assist such personnel in meeting State and local certification requirements and that, to the extent possible, describe how college or university credit will be awarded for such training.</p>
