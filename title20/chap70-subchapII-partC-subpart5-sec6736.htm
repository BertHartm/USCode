<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A State law that makes the school or governmental entity liable for the acts or omissions of its teachers to the same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or omissions of its employees.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) does not create a cause of action for punitive damages and does not preempt or supersede any Federal or State law to the extent that such law would further limit the award of punitive damages.</p>
