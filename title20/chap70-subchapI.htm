<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to ensure that all children have a fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards and state&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6301_1_target" name="6301_1">1</a></sup> academic assessments. This purpose can be accomplished by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensuring that high-quality academic assessments, accountability systems, teacher preparation and training, curriculum, and instructional materials are aligned with challenging State academic standards so that students, teachers, parents, and administrators can measure progress against common expectations for student academic achievement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) meeting the educational needs of low-achieving children in our Nation's highest-poverty schools, limited English proficient children, migratory children, children with disabilities, Indian children, neglected or delinquent children, and young children in need of reading assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) closing the achievement gap between high- and low-performing children, especially the achievement gaps between minority and nonminority students, and between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) holding schools, local educational agencies, and States accountable for improving the academic achievement of all students, and identifying and turning around low-performing schools that have failed to provide a high-quality education to their students, while providing alternatives to students in such schools to enable the students to receive a high-quality education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) distributing and targeting resources sufficiently to make a difference to local educational agencies and schools where needs are greatest;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1191 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) improving and strengthening accountability, teaching, and learning by using State assessment systems designed to ensure that students are meeting challenging State academic achievement and content standards and increasing achievement overall, but especially for the disadvantaged;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) providing greater decisionmaking authority and flexibility to schools and teachers in exchange for greater responsibility for student performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) providing children an enriched and accelerated educational program, including the use of schoolwide programs or additional services that increase the amount and quality of instructional time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) promoting schoolwide reform and ensuring the access of children to effective, scientifically based instructional strategies and challenging academic content;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) significantly elevating the quality of instruction by providing staff in participating schools with substantial opportunities for professional development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) coordinating services under all parts of this subchapter with each other, with other educational services, and, to the extent feasible, with other agencies providing services to youth, children, and families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) affording parents substantial and meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13153, May 3, 2000, 65 F.R. 26475, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.], the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2000 (as contained in Public Law 106&ndash;113) [Pub. L. 106&ndash;113, div. B, &sect;1000(a)(4) [title III], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1535, 1501A&ndash;242, see Tables for classification], and in order to take actions to improve low-performing schools, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Since 1993, this Administration has sought to raise standards for students and to increase accountability in public education while investing more resources in elementary and secondary schools. While much has been accomplished&mdash;there has been progress in math and reading achievement, particularly for low-achieving students and students in our highest poverty schools&mdash;much more can be done, especially for low-performing schools.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Technical Assistance and Capacity Building</em>. (a) The Secretary of Education (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall work with State and local educational agencies (&ldquo;LEAs&rdquo;) to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for providing technical assistance and other assistance to States and LEAs to strengthen their capacity to improve the performance of schools identified as low performing. This comprehensive strategy shall include a number of steps, such as:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) providing States, school districts, and schools receiving funds from the school improvement fund established by Public Law 106&ndash;113, as well as other districts and schools identified for school improvement or corrective action under Title I of the ESEA [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.], with access to the latest research and information on best practices, including research on instruction and educator professional development, and with the opportunity to learn from exemplary schools and exemplary State and local intervention strategies and from each other, in order to improve achievement for all students in the low-performing schools;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) determining effective ways of providing low-performing schools with access to resources from other Department of Education programs, such as funds from the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration Program, the Reading Excellence Act [Pub. L. 105&ndash;277, div. A, &sect;101(f) [title VIII], Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2681&ndash;337, 2681&ndash;391, see Tables for classification], the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, the Class Size Reduction Program, and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program, and to make effective use of these funds and Title I funds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) providing States and LEAs with information on effective strategies to improve the quality of the teaching force, including strategies for recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers in high-poverty schools, and implementing research-based professional development programs aligned with challenging standards;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) helping States and school districts build partnerships with technical assistance providers, including, but not limited to, federally funded laboratories and centers, foundations, businesses, community-based organizations, institutions of higher education, reform model providers, and other organizations that can help local schools improve;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) identifying previously low-performing schools that have made significant achievement gains, and States and school districts that have been effective in improving the achievement of all students in low-performing schools, which can serve as models and resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(6) providing assistance and information on how to effectively involve parents in the school-improvement process, including effectively involving and informing parents at the beginning of the school year about improvement goals for their school as well as the goals for their own children, and reporting on progress made in achieving these goals;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(7) providing States and LEAs with information on effective approaches to school accountability, including the effectiveness of such strategies as school reconstitution, peer review teams, and financial rewards and incentives;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(8) providing LEAs with information and assistance on the design and implementation of approaches to choice among public schools that create incentives for improvement throughout the local educational agency, especially in the lowest-performing schools, and that maximize the opportunity of students in low-performing schools to attend a higher-performing public school;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(9) exploring the use of well-trained tutors to raise student achievement through initiatives such as &ldquo;America Reads,&rdquo; &ldquo;America Counts,&rdquo; and other work-study opportunities to help low-performing schools;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(10) using a full range of strategies for disseminating information about effective practices, including interactive electronic communications;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(11) working with the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), to provide technical assistance to BIA-funded low-performing schools; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(12) taking other steps that can help improve the quality of teaching and instruction in low-performing schools.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, take whatever steps the Secretary finds necessary and appropriate to redirect the resources and technical assistance capability of the Department of Education (&ldquo;Department&rdquo;) to assist States and localities in improving low-performing schools, and to ensure that the dissemination of research to help turn around low-performing schools is a priority of the Department.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>School Improvement Report</em>. To monitor the progress of LEAs and schools in turning around failing schools, including those receiving grants from the School Improvement Fund, the Secretary shall prepare an annual School Improvement Report, to be published in September of each year, beginning in 2000. The report shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) describe trends in the numbers of LEAs and schools identified as needing improvement and subse<!-- PDFPage:1194 -->quent changes in the academic performance of their students;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) identify best practices and significant research findings that can be used to help turn around low-performing LEAs and schools; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) document ongoing efforts as a result of this order and other Federal efforts to assist States and local school districts in intervening in low-performing schools, including improving teacher quality. This report shall be publicly accessible.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Compliance Monitoring System</em>. Consistent with the implementation of the School Improvement Fund, the Secretary shall strengthen the Department's monitoring of ESEA requirements for identifying and turning around low-performing schools, as well as any new requirements established for the School Improvement Fund by Public Law 106&ndash;113. The Secretary shall give priority to provisions that have the greatest bearing on identifying and turning around low-performing schools, including sections 1116 and 1117 of the ESEA [20 U.S.C. 6316, 6317], and to developing an ongoing, focused, and systematic process for monitoring these provisions. This improved compliance monitoring shall be designed to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) ensure that States and LEAs comply with ESEA requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) assist States and LEAs in implementing effective procedures and strategies that reflect the best research available, as well as the experience of successful schools, school districts, and States as they address similar objectives and challenges; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) assist States, LEAs, and schools in making the most effective use of available Federal resources.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Consultation</em>. The Secretary shall, where appropriate, consult with executive agencies, State and local education officials, educators, community-based groups, and others in carrying out this Executive order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the subjects in which students will be served under this part, but for which a State is not required by subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to develop, and has not otherwise developed, such academic standards, the State plan shall describe a strategy for ensuring that students are taught the same knowledge and skills in such subjects and held to the same expectations as are all children.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Existing standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this part shall prohibit a State from revising, consistent with this section, any standard adopted under this part before or after January 8, 2002.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Accountability</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State has developed and is implementing a single, statewide State accountability system that will be effective in ensuring that all local educational agencies, public elementary schools, and public secondary schools make adequate yearly progress as defined under this paragraph. Each State accountability system shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) be based on the academic standards and academic assessments adopted under paragraphs (1) and (3), and other academic indicators consistent with subparagraph (C)(vi) and (vii), and shall take into account the achievement of all public elementary school and secondary school students;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) include sanctions and rewards, such as bonuses and recognition, the State will use to hold local educational agencies and public elementary schools and secondary schools accountable for student achievement and for ensuring that they make adequate yearly progress in accordance with the State's definition under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adequate yearly progress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State plan shall demonstrate, based on academic assessments described in paragraph (3), and in accordance with this paragraph, what constitutes adequate yearly progress of the State, and of all public elementary schools, secondary schools, and local educational agencies in the State, toward enabling all public elementary school and secondary school students to meet the State's student academic achievement standards, while working toward the goal of narrowing the achievement gaps in the State, local educational agencies, and schools.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) in accordance with subparagraph (D), includes graduation rates for public secondary school students (defined as the percentage of students who graduate from secondary school with a regular diploma in the standard number of years) and at least one other academic indicator, as determined by the State for all public elementary school students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) in accordance with subparagraph (D), at the State's discretion, may also include other academic indicators, as determined by the State for all public school students, measured separately for each group described in clause (v), such as achievement on additional State or locally administered assessments, decreases in grade-to-grade retention rates, attendance rates, and changes in the percentages of students completing gifted and talented, advanced placement, and college preparatory courses.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Requirements for other indicators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In carrying out subparagraph (C)(vi) and (vii), the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall ensure that the indicators described in those provisions are valid and reliable, and are consistent with relevant, nationally recognized professional and technical standards, if any; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (I)(i), may not use those indicators to reduce the number of, or change, the schools that would otherwise be subject to school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under section 6316 of this title if those additional indicators were not used, but may use them to identify additional schools for school improvement or in need of corrective action or restructuring.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Starting point</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State, using data for the 2001&ndash;2002 school year, shall establish the starting point for measuring, under subparagraphs (G) and (H), the percentage of students meeting or exceeding the State's proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments under paragraph (3) and pursuant to the timeline described in subparagraph (F). The starting point shall be, at a minimum, based on the higher of the percentage of students at the proficient level who are in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the State's lowest achieving group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v)(II); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the school at the 20th percentile in the State, based on enrollment, among all schools ranked by the percentage of students at the proficient level.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Timeline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall establish a timeline for adequate yearly progress. The timeline shall ensure that not later than 12 years after the end of the 2001&ndash;2002 school year, all students in each group described in subparagraph (C)(v) will meet or exceed the State's proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Measurable objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall establish statewide annual measurable objectives, pursuant to subparagraph (C)(v), for meeting the requirements of this paragraph, and which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be set separately for the assessments of mathematics and reading or language arts under subsection (a)(3) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be the same for all schools and local educational agencies in the State;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) shall ensure that all students will meet or exceed the State's proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments within the State's timeline under subparagraph (F); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) may be the same for more than 1 year, subject to the requirements of subparagraph (H).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Intermediate goals for annual yearly progress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall establish intermediate goals for meeting the requirements, including the measurable objectives in subparagraph (G), of this paragraph and that shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each year, for a school to make adequate yearly progress under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) each group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v) must meet or exceed the objectives set by the State under subparagraph (G), except that if any group de<!-- PDFPage:1199 -->scribed in subparagraph (C)(v) does not meet those objectives in any particular year, the school shall be considered to have made adequate yearly progress if the percentage of students in that group who did not meet or exceed the proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments under paragraph (3) for that year decreased by 10 percent of that percentage from the preceding school year and that group made progress on one or more of the academic indicators described in subparagraph (C)(vi) or (vii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not less than 95 percent of each group of students described in subparagraph (C)(v) who are enrolled in the school are required to take the assessments, consistent with paragraph (3)(C)(xi) and with accommodations, guidelines, and alternative assessments provided in the same manner as those provided under section 612(a)(16)(A) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(16)(A)] and paragraph (3), on which adequate yearly progress is based (except that the 95 percent requirement described in this clause shall not apply in a case in which the number of students in a category is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(J) Uniform averaging procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of determining whether schools are making adequate yearly progress, the State may establish a uniform procedure for averaging data which includes one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The State may average data from the school year for which the determination is made with data from one or two school years immediately preceding that school year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Until the assessments described in paragraph (3) are administered in such manner and time to allow for the implementation of the uniform procedure for averaging data described in clause (i), the State may use the academic assessments that were required under paragraph (3) as that paragraph was in effect on the day preceding January 8, 2002, provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed to undermine or delay the determination of adequate yearly progress, the requirements of section 6316 of this title, or the implementation of assessments under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The State may use data across grades in a school.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(K) Accountability for charter schools</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State educational agency, in consultation with local educational agencies, has implemented a set of high-quality, yearly student academic assessments that include, at a minimum, academic assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and science that will be used as the primary means of determining the yearly performance of the State and of each local educational agency and school in the State in enabling all children to meet the State's challenging student academic achievement standards, except that no State shall be required to meet the requirements of this part relating to science assessments until the beginning of the 2007&ndash;2008 school year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State educational agency may incorporate the data from the assessments under this paragraph into a State-developed longitudinal data system that links student test scores, length of enrollment, and graduation records over time.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such assessments shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) be the same academic assessments used to measure the achievement of all children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) be aligned with the State's challenging academic content and student academic achievement standards, and provide coherent information about student attainment of such standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) be used for purposes for which such assessments are valid and reliable, and be consistent with relevant, nationally recognized professional and technical standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) be used only if the State educational agency provides to the Secretary evidence from the test publisher or other relevant sources that the assessments used are of adequate technical quality for each purpose required under this chapter and are consistent with the requirements of this section, and such evidence is made public by the Secretary upon request;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) grades 3 through 5;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) grades 6 through 9; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(cc) grades 10 through 12;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) beginning not later than school year 2005&ndash;2006, measure the achievement of students against the challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards in each of grades 3 <!-- PDFPage:1200 -->through 8 in, at a minimum, mathematics, and reading or language arts, except that the Secretary may provide the State 1 additional year if the State demonstrates that exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State, prevented full implementation of the academic assessments by that deadline and that the State will complete implementation within the additional 1-year period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) at the discretion of the State, measure the proficiency of students in academic subjects not described in clauses (v), (vi), (vii) in which the State has adopted challenging academic content and academic achievement standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participation in such assessments of all students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the reasonable adaptations and accommodations for students with disabilities (as defined under section 602(3) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1401(3)]) necessary to measure the academic achievement of such students relative to State academic content and State student academic achievement standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the inclusion of limited English proficient students, who shall be assessed in a valid and reliable manner and provided reasonable accommodations on assessments administered to such students under this paragraph, including, to the extent practicable, assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate data on what such students know and can do in academic content areas, until such students have achieved English language proficiency as determined under paragraph (7);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(x) notwithstanding subclause (III), the academic assessment (using tests written in English) of reading or language arts of any student who has attended school in the United States (not including Puerto Rico) for three or more consecutive school years, except that if the local educational agency determines, on a case-by-case individual basis, that academic assessments in another language or form would likely yield more accurate and reliable information on what such student knows and can do, the local educational agency may make a determination to assess such student in the appropriate language other than English for a period that does not exceed two additional consecutive years, provided that such student has not yet reached a level of English language proficiency sufficient to yield valid and reliable information on what such student knows and can do on tests (written in English) of reading or language arts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xi) include students who have attended schools in a local educational agency for a full academic year but have not attended a single school for a full academic year, except that the performance of students who have attended more than 1 school in the local educational agency in any academic year shall be used only in determining the progress of the local educational agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xii) produce individual student interpretive, descriptive, and diagnostic reports, consistent with clause (iii) that allow parents, teachers, and principals to understand and address the specific academic needs of students, and include information regarding achievement on academic assessments aligned with State academic achievement standards, and that are provided to parents, teachers, and principals, as soon as is practicably possible after the assessment is given, in an understandable and uniform format, and to the extent practicable, in a language that parents can understand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xiii) enable results to be disaggregated within each State, local educational agency, and school by gender, by each major racial and ethnic group, by English proficiency status, by migrant status, by students with disabilities as compared to nondisabled students, and by economically disadvantaged students as compared to students who are not economically disadvantaged, except that, in the case of a local educational agency or a school, such disaggregation shall not be required in a case in which the number of students in a category is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xiv) be consistent with widely accepted professional testing standards, objectively measure academic achievement, knowledge, and skills, and be tests that do not evaluate or assess personal or family beliefs and attitudes, or publicly disclose personally identifiable information; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xv) enable itemized score analyses to be produced and reported, consistent with clause (iii), to local educational agencies and schools, so that parents, teachers, principals, and administrators can interpret and address the specific academic needs of students as indicated by the students&rsquo; achievement on assessment items.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Deferral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State may defer the commencement, or suspend the administration, but not cease the development, of the assessments described in this paragraph, that were not required prior to January 8, 2002, for 1 year for each year for which the amount appropriated for grants under section 7301b(a)(2) of this title is less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) $370,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) $400,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2007.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Academic assessment measures in addition to those in paragraph (3) that do not meet the requirements of such paragraph may be included in the assessment under paragraph (3) <!-- PDFPage:1201 -->as additional measures, but may not be used in lieu of the academic assessments required under paragraph (3). Such additional assessment measures may not be used to reduce the number of or change, the schools that would otherwise be subject to school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under section 6316 of this title if such additional indicators were not used, but may be used to identify additional schools for school improvement or in need of corrective action or restructuring except as provided in paragraph (2)(I)(i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) State authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State educational agency provides evidence, which is satisfactory to the Secretary, that neither the State educational agency nor any other State government official, agency, or entity has sufficient authority, under State law, to adopt curriculum content and student academic achievement standards, and academic assessments aligned with such academic standards, which will be applicable to all students enrolled in the State's public elementary schools and secondary schools, then the State educational agency may meet the requirements of this subsection by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) adopting academic standards and academic assessments that meet the requirements of this subsection, on a statewide basis, and limiting their applicability to students served under this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adopting and implementing policies that ensure that each local educational agency in the State that receives grants under this part will adopt curriculum content and student academic achievement standards, and academic assessments aligned with such standards, which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) meet all of the criteria in this subsection and any regulations regarding such standards and assessments that the Secretary may publish; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are applicable to all students served by each such local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Language assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State plan shall identify the languages other than English that are present in the participating student population and indicate the languages for which yearly student academic assessments are not available and are needed. The State shall make every effort to develop such assessments and may request assistance from the Secretary if linguistically accessible academic assessment measures are needed.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall use funds received under this part only in eligible school attendance areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible school attendance areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the term &ldquo;school attendance area&rdquo; means, in relation to a particular school, the geographical area in which the children who are normally served by that school reside; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the term &ldquo;eligible school attendance area&rdquo; means a school attendance area in which the percentage of children from low-income families is at least as high as the percentage of children from low-income families served by the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Ranking order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds allocated in accordance with subsection (c) of this section are insufficient to serve all eligible school attendance areas, a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank, without regard to grade spans, such agency's eligible school attendance areas in which the concentration of children from low-income families exceeds 75 percent from highest to lowest according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Remaining funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds remain after serving all eligible school attendance areas under paragraph (3), a local educational agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually rank such agency's remaining eligible school attendance areas from highest to lowest either by grade span or for the entire local educational agency according to the percentage of children from low-income families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serve such eligible school attendance areas in rank order either within each grade-span grouping or within the local educational agency as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agency shall use the same measure of poverty, which measure shall be the number of children ages 5 through 17 in poverty counted in the most recent census data approved by the Secretary, the number of children eligible for free and reduced priced lunches under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], the number of children in families receiving assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], or the number of children eligible to receive medical assistance under the Medicaid program, or a composite of such indicators, with respect to all school attendance areas in the local educational agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to identify eligible school attendance areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to determine the ranking of each area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to determine allocations under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver for desegregation plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a local educational agency's written request for a waiver of the requirements of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, and permit such agency to treat as eligible, and serve, any school that children attend with a State-ordered, court-ordered school desegregation plan or a plan that continues to be implemented in accordance with a State-ordered or court-ordered desegregation plan, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of economically disadvantaged children enrolled in the school is at least 25 percent of the school's total enrollment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines on the basis of a written request from such agency and in accordance with such criteria as the Secretary establishes, that approval of that request would further the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Local educational agency discretion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, a local educational agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designate as eligible any school attendance area or school in which at least 35 percent of the children are from low-income families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) use funds received under this part in a school that is not in an eligible school attendance area, if the percentage of children from low-income families enrolled in the school is equal to or greater than the percentage of such children in a participating school attendance area of such agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) designate and serve a school attendance area or school that is not eligible under this section, but that was eligible and that was served in the preceding fiscal year, but only for 1 additional fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) elect not to serve an eligible school attendance area or eligible school that has a higher percentage of children from low-income families if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the school meets the comparability requirements of section 6321(c) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the school is receiving supplemental funds from other State or local sources that are spent according to the requirements of section 6314 or 6315 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the funds expended from such other sources equal or exceed the amount that would be provided under this part.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1212 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(D), the number of children attending private elementary schools and secondary schools who are to receive services, and the assistance such children are to receive under this part, shall be determined without regard to whether the public school attendance area in which such children reside is assisted under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall allocate funds received under this part to eligible school attendance areas or eligible schools, identified under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, in rank order, on the basis of the total number of children from low-income families in each area or school.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency shall reserve such funds as are necessary under this part to provide services comparable to those provided to children in schools funded under this part to serve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) homeless children who do not attend participating schools, including providing educationally related support services to children in shelters and other locations where children may live;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) children in local institutions for neglected children; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Standards for a bypass</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a local educational agency is prohibited by law from providing for the participation in programs on an equitable basis of eligible children enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools, or if the Secretary determines that a local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling, to provide for such participation, as required by this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grants for local educational agencies and Puerto Rico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (4) and in section 6338 of this title, the grant that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this section for a fiscal year is the amount determined by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in the State, except that the amount determined under this subparagraph shall not be less than 32 percent, or more than 48 percent, of the average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculation of grants</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Allocations to local educational agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall calculate grants under this section on the basis of the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for local educational agencies, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of those data are unreliable or that their use would be otherwise inappropriate, in which case&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the two Secretaries shall publicly disclose the reasons for their determination in detail; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) paragraph (3) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocations to large and small local educational agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For any fiscal year to which this paragraph applies, the Secretary shall calculate grants under this section for each local educational agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The amount of a grant under this section for each large local educational agency shall be the amount determined under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For small local educational agencies, the State educational agency may either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) distribute grants under this section in amounts determined by the Secretary under clause (i); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) use an alternative method approved by the Secretary to distribute the portion of the State's total grants under this section that is based on those small agencies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) An alternative method under clause (iii)(II) shall be based on population data that the State educational agency determines best reflect the current distribution of children in poor families among the State's small local educational agencies that meet the eligibility criteria of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) If a small local educational agency is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State educational agency under clause (iii)(II), it may appeal that determination to the Secretary, who shall respond not later than 45 days after receipt of such appeal.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Direct allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, or for which the State believes it has data that would better target funds than allocating them by county, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority to make the allocations under this subpart for a particular fiscal year directly to local educational agencies without regard to counties.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1240 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Allocations to local educational agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary approves the State educational agency's application under subparagraph (B), the State educational agency shall provide the Secretary an assurance that such allocations shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this subpart; or</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Appeal</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the application of subparagraph (B) would result in any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia receiving less under this subpart than it received under this subpart for the preceding fiscal year, the percentage in subparagraph (A) shall be the greater of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for the preceding fiscal year; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum number of children to qualify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A local educational agency is eligible for a basic grant under this section for any fiscal year only if the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for that agency is both&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency from families above the poverty level as determined under paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of number of children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data, described in paragraph (3), available from the Department of Commerce. The District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be treated as individual local educational agencies. If a local educational agency contains two or more counties in their entirety, then each county will be treated as if such county were a separate local educational agency for purposes of calculating grants under this part. The total of grants for such counties shall be allocated to such a local educational agency, which local educational agency shall distribute to schools in each county within such agency a share of the local educational agency's total grant that is no less than the county's share of the population counts used to calculate the local educational agency's grant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Population updates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In fiscal year 2002 and each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall use updated data on the number of children, aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level for counties or local educational agencies, published by the Department of Commerce, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that the use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable. If appropriate and reliable data are not available annually, the Secretary shall use data which are updated every 2 years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Inappropriate or unreliable data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data <!-- PDFPage:1241 -->referred to in subparagraph (A) are inappropriate or unreliable, the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce shall publicly disclose their reasons.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Criteria of poverty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the families that are below the poverty level, the Secretary shall use the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census, as the criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other children to be counted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For the purpose of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families above the poverty level on the basis of the number of such children from families receiving an annual income, in excess of the current criteria of poverty, from payments under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]; and in making such determinations, the Secretary shall use the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census for a family of four in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall determine the number of such children and the number of children aged 5 through 17 living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, or being supported in foster homes with public funds, on the basis of the caseload data for the month of October of the preceding fiscal year (using, in the case of children described in the preceding sentence, the criteria of poverty and the form of such criteria required by such sentence which were determined for the calendar year preceding such month of October) or, to the extent that such data are not available to the Secretary before January of the calendar year in which the Secretary's determination is made, then on the basis of the most recent reliable data available to the Secretary at the time of such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Except for the data on children living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall collect and transmit the information required by this subparagraph to the Secretary not later than January 1 of each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For the purpose of this section, the Secretary shall consider all children who are in correctional institutions to be living in institutions for delinquent children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Estimate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When requested by the Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce shall make a special updated estimate of the number of children of such ages who are from families below the poverty level (as determined under paragraph (1)(A)) in each school district, and the Secretary is authorized to pay (either in advance or by way of reimbursement) the Secretary of Commerce the cost of making this special estimate. The Secretary of Commerce shall give consideration to any request of the chief executive of a State for the collection of additional census information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State minimum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 6332 of this title, the aggregate amount allotted for all local educational agencies within a State may not be less than the lesser of&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6336. Adequacy of funding of targeted grants to local educational agencies in fiscal years after fiscal year 2001</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The current Basic Grant Formula for the distribution of funds under this part often does not provide funds for the economically disadvantaged students for which such funds are targeted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any school district in which more than 2 percent of the students live below the poverty level qualifies for funding under the Basic Grant Formula. As a result, 9 out of every 10 school districts in the country receive some form of aid under the Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Fifty-eight percent of all schools receive at least some funding under this part, including many suburban schools with predominantly well-off students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) One out of every 5 schools with concentrations of poor students between 50 and 75 percent receive no funding at all under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In passing the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, Congress declared that grants under this part would more sharply target high poverty schools by using the Targeted Grant Formula, but annual appropriation Acts have prevented the use of that Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The advantage of the Targeted Grant Formula over other funding formulas under this part is that the Targeted Grant Formula provides increased grants per poor child as the percentage of economically disadvantaged children in a school district increases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Studies have found that the poverty of a child's family is much more likely to be associated with educational disadvantage if the family lives in an area with large concentrations of poor families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) States with large populations of high poverty students would receive significantly more funding if more funds under this part were allocated through the Targeted Grant Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Congress has an obligation to allocate funds under this part so that such funds will positively affect the largest number of economically disadvantaged students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on allocation of subchapter I funds contingent on adequate funding of targeted grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to section 6332 of this title, the total amount allocated in any fiscal year after fiscal year 2001 for programs and activities under this part shall not exceed the amount allocated in fiscal year 2001 for such programs and activities unless the amount available for targeted grants to local educational agencies under section 6335 of this title in the applicable fiscal year meets the requirements of section 6332(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) adjust the full-time equivalent number of migratory children who reside in each State to take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the special needs of those children participating in special programs provided under this part that operate during the summer and intersession periods; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to support State and local efforts to raise academic standards through advanced placement programs, and thus further increase the number of students who participate and succeed in advanced placement programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage more of the 600,000 students who take advanced placement courses each year but do not take advanced placement exams each year, to demonstrate their achievements through taking the exams;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to build on the many benefits of advanced placement programs for students, which benefits may include the acquisition of skills that are important to many employers, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores that are 100 points above the national averages, and the achievement of better grades in secondary school and in college than the grades of students who have not participated in the programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to increase the availability and broaden the range of schools, including middle schools, that have advanced placement and pre-advanced placement programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to demonstrate that larger and more diverse groups of students can participate and succeed in advanced placement programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to provide greater access to advanced placement and pre-advanced placement courses and highly trained teachers for low-income and other disadvantaged students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to provide access to advanced placement courses for secondary school students at schools that do not offer advanced placement programs, increase the rate at which secondary school students participate in advanced placement courses, and increase the numbers of students who receive advanced placement test scores for which college academic credit is awarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to increase the participation of low-income individuals in taking advanced placement tests through the payment or partial payment of the costs of the advanced placement test fees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) to increase the number of individuals that achieve a baccalaureate or advanced degree, and to decrease the amount of time such individuals require to attain such degrees.</p>
