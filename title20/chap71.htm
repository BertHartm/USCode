<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a Department of Education was established in 1867 &ldquo;for the purpose of collecting such statistics and facts as shall show the condition and progress of education in the several States and territories, and of diffusing such information respecting the organization and management of schools and school systems and methods of teaching as shall aid the people of the United States in the establishment and maintenance of efficient school systems, and otherwise promote the cause of education throughout the United States&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) today, while the role of the current Department of Education is much broader, the National Center for Education Statistics within the Office of Educational Research and Improvement continues to perform those crucial original purposes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) looking to the 21st century, the National Center for Education Statistics must be able to design and undertake, effectively and efficiently, statistical activities that will aid in the reform of the Nation's educational systems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure the continuation of an effective mechanism for collecting and reporting statistics and information showing the condition and progress of education in the United States and other nations in order to promote and accelerate the improvement of American education.</p>
