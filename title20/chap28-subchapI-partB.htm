<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that, in an effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on college campuses, all institutions of higher education should carry out the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The president of the institution should appoint a task force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students, Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full examination of student and academic life at the institution. The task force should make recommendations for a broad range of policy and program changes that would serve to reduce alcohol and other drug-related problems. The institution should provide resources to assist the task force in promoting the campus policies and proposed environmental changes that have been identified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The institution should enforce a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by students at the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The institution should vigorously enforce the institution's code of disciplinary sanctions for those who violate campus alcohol policies. Students with alcohol or other drug-related problems should be referred for assistance, including on-campus counseling programs if appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The institution should adopt a policy to discourage alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus activities. It should adopt policies limiting the advertisement and promotion of alcoholic beverages on campus.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:189 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The institution should work with the local community, including local businesses, in a &ldquo;Town/Gown&rdquo; alliance to encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and to address illegal alcohol use by students.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Public benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress declares that, if a facility constructed with the aid of a grant under part A of subchapter VII of this chapter as such part A was in effect prior to October 7, 1998, or part B of such subchapter as part B was in effect prior to July 23, 1992, is used as an academic facility for 20 years following completion of such construction, the public benefit accruing to the United States will equal in value the amount of the grant. The period of 20 years after completion of such construction shall therefore be deemed to be the period of Federal interest in such facility for the purposes of such subchapter as so in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recovery upon cessation of public benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, within 20 years after completion of construction of an academic facility which has been constructed, in part with a grant under part A of subchapter VII of this chapter as such part A was in effect prior to October 7, 1998, or part B of subchapter VII of this chapter as such part B was in effect prior to July 23, 1992&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the facility ceases to be used as an academic facility, or the facility is used as a facility excluded from the term &ldquo;academic facility&rdquo; (as such term was defined under subchapter VII of this chapter, as so in effect), unless the Secretary determines that there is good cause for releasing the institution from its obligation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the United States shall be entitled to recover from such applicant (or successor) an amount which bears to the value of the facility at that time (or so much thereof as constituted an approved project or projects) the same ratio as the amount of Federal grant bore to the cost of the facility financed with the aid of such grant. The value shall be determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in the United States district court for the district in which such facility is situated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibition on use for religion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, no project assisted with funds under subchapter VII of this chapter (as in effect prior to October 7, 1998) shall ever be used for religious worship or a sectarian activity or for a school or department of divinity.</p>
