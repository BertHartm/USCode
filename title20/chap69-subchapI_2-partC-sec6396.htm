<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provides that migratory children will have an opportunity to meet the same challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards, set out in such plans, that all children are expected to meet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) specifies measurable program goals and outcomes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) encompasses the full range of services that are available for migratory children from appropriate local, State, and Federal educational programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) is the product of joint planning among such local, State, and Federal programs, including programs under part A of this subchapter, early childhood programs, and bilingual education programs under part A of subchapter VII of this chapter; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) before funds under this part are used to provide services described in subparagraph (B), such funds shall be used to meet the identified needs of migratory children that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) result from the effects of their migratory lifestyle, or are needed to permit migratory children to participate effectively in school; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are not addressed by services provided under other programs, including programs under part A of this subchapter; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
