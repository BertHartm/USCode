<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reservations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reserve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 50 percent of the amount appropriated pursuant to the authority of section 1134g of this title to award grants to institutions of higher education to enable such institutions to make awards for master's level and professional study; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applications</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider the need to prepare a larger number of women and individuals from minority groups, especially from among such groups which have been traditionally underrepresented in professional and academic careers requiring master's level, professional, or doctoral degrees, but nothing contained in this paragraph shall be interpreted to require any institution to grant preference or disparate treatment to the members of one minority group on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of individuals of such group participating in or receiving the benefits of the program authorized in this section, in comparison with the total number or percentage of individuals of such group in any community, State, section, or other area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) take into account the need to expand access by women and minority groups to careers heretofore lacking adequate representation of women and minority groups; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall assure that, in making grants under this part, a priority for awards is accorded to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) individuals from minority groups and women who are pursuing master's level or professional study in fields in which they are underrepresented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) individuals from minority groups and women who are pursuing master's level study leading to careers that serve the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) women and individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups undertaking doctoral study, including those interested in entering the fields of science and mathematics.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to individuals who first receive fellowships during or after academic year 1993&ndash;1994&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) $9,000 for the academic year 1993&ndash;1994; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for succeeding academic years, $9,000 adjusted annually thereafter in accordance with inflation as determined by the Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for the previous calendar year.</p>
