<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term &ldquo;average per pupil expenditure&rdquo;, in the United States, means the aggregate current expenditures, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the computation is made (or, if satisfactory data for such year are not available at the time of computation, then during the most recent preceding fiscal year for which satisfactory data are available) of all local educational agencies in the United States (which, for purposes of this subsection, means the fifty States and the District of Columbia), as the case may be, plus any direct expenditures by the State for operation of such agencies (without regard to the source of funds from which either of such expenditures are made), divided by the aggregate number of children in average daily attendance to whom such agencies provided free public education during such preceding year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In determining the allotment of each State under paragraph (1), the Secretary may not count&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) children with disabilities aged three to seventeen, inclusive, in such State under paragraph (1)(A) to the extent the number of such children is greater than 12 percent of the number of all children aged three to seventeen, inclusive, in such State, or the combined percentage of such children counted by the Secretary for the purpose of making fiscal year 1994 allocations under this section and under subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such subpart was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994), whichever is greater, if the State serves all children with disabilities aged three to five, inclusive, in the State pursuant to State law or practice or the order of any court, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, for fiscal year 1998 or 1999, the number of children determined under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any State is less than the total number of children with disabilities, aged 3 through 21, counted for that State's fiscal year 1994 grants under this section and under subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such subpart was in effect on October 20, 1994), then the amount determined under paragraph (1) for that State shall be reduced by the same percentage by which the number of those children so declined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the sums made available under this subchapter for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that all States are eligible to receive under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce the allocations to such States for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If additional funds become available for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such fiscal year, allocations that were re<!-- PDFPage:694 -->duced under subparagraph (A) shall be increased on the same basis as such allocations were reduced.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) From the total amount of funds available for any fiscal year under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section, the State shall provide to each local educational agency or intermediate educational unit an amount that bears the same ratio to such total amount as the number of children, aged 3 through 21, determined under subsection (a)(3) of this section for such agency or unit bears to the total number of such children determined for all such agencies and units that apply for such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) To the extent necessary, the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall use funds available under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section to ensure that each State agency that received funds for fiscal year 1994 under subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as such subpart was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) receives, from the sum of such funds and funds provided under paragraph (1), an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purpose of subparagraph (A), the number of children determined under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any State agency or local educational agency shall not exceed the number of children aged 3 through 21 for whom such agency received funds under such subpart for such fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reductions or increases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) If the sums appropriated under subsection (h) of this section for any fiscal year are not sufficient to pay in full the total of the amounts that all States are eligible to receive under subsection (a) of this section, each such amount shall be ratably reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If additional funds become available for making such payments for any fiscal year, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any State that receives any such additional funds shall distribute such funds in accordance with this section, except that any State that has used funds available under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section for the purposes described in subsection (d)(2) of this section may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) deduct, from the amount that the State would otherwise be required to make available to local educational agencies and intermediate educational units, the same amount of such additional funds as the State so used; and</p>
