<p class="statutory-body">From the funds made available pursuant to section 7111(a)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7118_1_target" name="7118_1">1</a></sup> of this title to carry out this section, the Secretary shall make grants to or enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with organizations primarily serving and representing Native Hawaiians which are recognized by the Governor of the State of Hawaii to plan, conduct, and administer programs, or portions thereof, which are authorized by and consistent with the provisions of this subchapter for the benefit of Native Hawaiians.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Native Hawaiian&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Native Hawaiian&rdquo; means any individual any of whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area which now comprises the State of Hawaii.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 7111(a)(4) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original &ldquo;section 4111(a)(4)&rdquo;, meaning section 4111(a)(4) of Pub. L. 89&ndash;10, which was translated as reading section 4011(a)(4) of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 89&ndash;10 does not contain a section 4111, but does contain a section 4011(a)(4) which makes funds available to carry out programs under this section.</p>
