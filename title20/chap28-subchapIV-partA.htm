<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program authority and method of distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For each fiscal year through fiscal year 2017, the Secretary shall pay to each eligible institution such sums as may be necessary to pay to each eligible student (defined in accordance with section 1091 of this title) for each academic year during which that student is in attendance at an institution of higher education, as an undergraduate, a Federal Pell Grant in the amount for which that student is eligible, as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Not less than 85 percent of such sums shall be advanced to eligible institutions prior to the start of each payment period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the institution as needed to pay eligible students until such time as the Secretary determines and publishes in the Federal Register with an opportunity for comment, an alternative payment system that provides payments to institutions in an accurate and timely manner, except that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to place an institution on a reimbursement system of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to students, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an amount for which they are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Grants made under this subpart shall be known as &ldquo;Federal Pell Grants&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose and amount of grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of this subpart is to provide a Federal Pell Grant that in combination with reasonable family and student contribution and supplemented by the programs authorized under subparts 3 and 4 of this part, will meet at least 75 percent of a student's cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title), unless the institution determines that a greater amount of assistance would better serve the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the Federal Pell Grant for a student eligible under this part shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $6,000 for academic year 2009&ndash;2010;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $6,400 for academic year 2010&ndash;2011;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) $6,800 for academic year 2011&ndash;2012;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) $7,200 for academic year 2012&ndash;2013;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) $7,600 for academic year 2013&ndash;2014; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) $8,000 for academic year 2014&ndash;2015,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the expected family contribution with respect to that student for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where a student attends an institution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (including a student who attends an institution of higher education on less than a half-time basis) during any academic year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant to which that student is entitled shall be reduced in proportion to the degree to which that student is not so attending on a full-time basis, in accordance with a schedule of reductions established by the Secretary for the purposes of this division, computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No Federal Pell Grant under this subpart shall exceed the difference between the expected family contribution for a student and the cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title) at the institution at which that student is in attendance. If, with respect to any student, it is determined that the amount of a Federal Pell Grant plus the amount of the expected family contribution for that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant shall be reduced until the combination of expected family contribution and the amount of the Federal Pell Grant does not exceed the cost of attendance at such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No Federal Pell Grant shall be awarded to a student under this subpart if the amount of <!-- PDFPage:297 -->that grant for that student as determined under this subsection for any academic year is less than ten percent of the maximum basic grant level specified in the appropriate appropriation Act for such academic year, except that a student who is eligible for a Federal Pell Grant in an amount that is equal to or greater than five percent of such level but less than ten percent of such level shall be awarded a Federal Pell grant in the amount of ten percent of such level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary shall award a student not more than two Federal Pell Grants during a single award year to permit such student to accelerate the student's progress toward a degree or certificate if the student is enrolled&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on at least a half-time basis for a period of more than one academic year, or more than two semesters or an equivalent period of time, during a single award year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in a program of instruction at an institution of higher education for which the institution awards an associate or baccalaureate degree or a certificate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a student receiving more than one Federal Pell Grant in a single award year under subparagraph (A), the total amount of Federal Pell Grants awarded to such student for the award year may exceed the maximum basic grant level specified in the appropriate appropriations Act for such award year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the Secretary shall allow the amount of the Federal Pell Grant to be exceeded for students participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the institution at which the student is enrolled when the reasonable costs of such program are greater than the cost of attendance at the student's home institution, except that the amount of such Federal Pell Grant in any fiscal year shall not exceed the grant level specified in the appropriate Appropriation Act for this subpart for such year. If the preceding sentence applies, the financial aid administrator at the home institution may use the cost of the study abroad program, rather than the home institution's cost, to determine the cost of attendance of the student.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) No Federal Pell Grant shall be awarded under this subpart to any individual who is incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution or who is subject to an involuntary civil commitment upon completion of a period of incarceration for a forcible or nonforcible sexual offense (as determined in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) <cap-smallcap>Additional funds.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(x) $4,900,000,000 for fiscal year 2017.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Increase in federal pell grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The amounts made available pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be used to increase the amount of the maximum Federal Pell Grant for which a student shall be eligible during an award year, as specified in the last enacted appropriation Act applicable to that award year, by&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall only award an increased amount of a Federal Pell Grant under this section for any award year pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph to students who qualify for a Federal Pell Grant award under the maximum grant award enacted in the annual appropriation Act for such award year without regard to the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Program requirements and operations otherwise unaffected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to alter the requirements and operations of the Federal Pell Grant Program as authorized under this section, or authorize the imposition of additional requirements or operations for the determination and allocation of Federal Pell Grants under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period of eligibility for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The period during which a student may receive Federal Pell Grants shall be the period required for the completion of the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study being pursued by that student at the institution at which the student is in attendance except that any period during which the student is enrolled in a noncredit or remedial course of study as defined in paragraph (2) shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility courses of study which are noncredit or remedial in nature (including courses in English language instruction) which are determined by the institution to be necessary to help the student be prepared for the pursuit of a first undergraduate baccalaureate degree or certificate or, in the case of courses in English language instruction, to be necessary to enable the student to utilize already existing knowledge, <!-- PDFPage:298 -->training, or skills. Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the student is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No student is entitled to receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one institution or from the Secretary and an institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive a Federal Pell Grant if the student&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is carrying at least one-half the normal full-time work load for the course of study the student is pursuing, as determined by the institution of higher education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in a postbaccalaureate program that does not lead to a graduate degree, and in courses required by a State in order for the student to receive a professional certification or licensing credential that is required for employment as a teacher in an elementary school or secondary school in that State,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that this paragraph shall not apply to a student who is enrolled in an institution of higher education that offers a baccalaureate degree in education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The period during which a student may receive Federal Pell Grants shall not exceed 18 semesters, or the equivalent of 18 semesters, as determined by the Secretary by regulation. Such regulations shall provide, with respect to a student who received a Federal Pell Grant for a term but was enrolled at a fraction of full-time, that only that same fraction of such semester or equivalent shall count towards such duration limits. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only to a student who receives a Federal Pell Grant for the first time on or after July 1, 2008.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applications for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall from time to time set dates by which students shall file applications for Federal Pell Grants under this subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each student desiring a Federal Pell Grant for any year shall file an application therefor containing such information and assurances as the Secretary may deem necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out the functions and responsibilities of this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distribution of grants to students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments under this section shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary for such purpose, in such manner as will best accomplish the purpose of this section. Any disbursement allowed to be made by crediting the student's account shall be limited to tuition and fees and, in the case of institutionally owned housing, room and board. The student may elect to have the institution provide other such goods and services by crediting the student's account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Calculation of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart (including a central processor, if any, designated by the Secretary) shall, in a timely manner, furnish to the student financial aid administrator (at each institution of higher education which a student awarded a Federal Pell Grant under this subpart is attending), as a part of its regular output document, the expected family contribution for each such student. Each such student financial aid administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) examine and assess the data used to calculate the expected family contribution of the student furnished pursuant to this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recalculate the expected family contribution of the student if there has been a change in circumstances of the student or in the data submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make the award to the student in the correct amount; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) after making such award report the corrected data to such contractor and to a central processor (if any) designated by the Secretary for a confirmation of the correct computation of amount of the expected family contribution for each such student.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a student receives an award under this subpart that, due to recalculation errors by the institution of higher education, is in excess of the amount which the student is entitled to receive under this subpart, such institution of higher education shall pay to the Secretary the amount of such excess unless such excess can be resolved in a subsequent disbursement to the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart shall for each academic year after academic year 1986&ndash;1987 prepare and submit a report to the Secretary on the correctness of the computations of amount of the expected family contribution, and on the accuracy of the questions on the application form under this subpart for the previous academic year for which the contractor is responsible. The Secretary shall transmit the report, together with the comments and recommendations of the Secretary, to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and the authorizing committees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Insufficient appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, for any fiscal year, the funds appropriated for payments under this subpart are insufficient to satisfy fully all entitlements, as calculated under subsection (b) of this section (but at the maximum grant level specified in such appropriation), the Secretary shall promptly transmit a notice of such insufficiency to each House of the Congress, and identify in such notice the additional amount that would be required to be appropriated to satisfy fully all entitlements (as so calculated at such maximum grant level).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Use of excess funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by 15 percent or less, then all of the excess funds shall remain available for making payments under this subpart during the next succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the <!-- PDFPage:299 -->payments required under this subpart to eligible students by more than 15 percent, then all of such funds shall remain available for making such payments but payments may be made under this paragraph only with respect to entitlements for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Treatment of institutions and students under other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any institution of higher education which enters into an agreement with the Secretary to disburse to students attending that institution the amounts those students are eligible to receive under this subpart shall not be deemed, by virtue of such agreement, a contractor maintaining a system of records to accomplish a function of the Secretary. Recipients of Pell Grants shall not be considered to be individual grantees for purposes of subtitle D of title V of Public Law 100&ndash;690 [41 U.S.C. 701 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Institutional ineligibility based on default rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No institution of higher education shall be an eligible institution for purposes of this subpart if such institution of higher education is ineligible to participate in a loan program under part B or C of this subchapter as a result of a final default rate determination made by the Secretary under part B or C of this subchapter after the final publication of cohort default rates for fiscal year 1996 or a succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sanctions subject to appeal opportunity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No institution may be subject to the terms of this subsection unless the institution has had the opportunity to appeal the institution's default rate determination under regulations issued by the Secretary for the loan program authorized under part B or C of this subchapter, as applicable. This subsection shall not apply to an institution that was not participating in the loan program authorized under part B or C of this subchapter on October 7, 1998, unless the institution subsequently participates in the loan programs.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) From the sums appropriated pursuant to section 1070c(b)(1) of this title and not reserved under section 1070c(b)(2) of this title for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the number of students who are deemed eligible in such State for participation in the grant program authorized by this subpart bears to the total number of such students in all the States, except that no State shall receive less than the State received for fiscal year 1979.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of this subsection, the number of students who are deemed eligible in a State for participation in the grant program authorized by this subpart, and the number of such students in all the States, shall be determined for the most recent year for which satisfactory data are available.</p>

The total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount reallotted to a State under this part during a year from funds appropriated pursuant to section 1070c(b)(1) of this title shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provides that if the State's allocation under this subpart is based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students who are independent students or attending the institution less than full time, a reasonable proportion of the State's allocation shall be made available to such students;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reservation and disbursement of allotments and reallotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon his approval of any application for a payment under this subpart, the Secretary shall reserve from the applicable allotment (including any applicable reallotment) available therefor, the amount of such payment, which (subject to the limits of such allotment or reallotment) shall be equal to the Federal share of the cost of the students&rsquo; incentive grants or work-study jobs covered by such application. The Secretary shall pay such reserved amount, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may amend the reservation of any amount under this section, either upon approval of an amendment of the application or upon revision of the estimated cost of the student grants or work-study jobs with respect to which such reservation was made. If the Secretary approves an upward revision of such estimated cost, the Secretary may reserve the Federal share of the added cost only from the applicable allotment (or reallotment) available at the time of such approval.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Direct payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to teacher candidates, in advance of the begin<!-- PDFPage:353 -->ning of the academic term, an amount for which teacher candidates are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).</p>

Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No exceeding cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of a grant awarded under this subpart, in combination with Federal assistance and other assistance the student may receive, shall not exceed the cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title) at the eligible institution at which that teacher candidate is in attendance.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial course; study abroad</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude from eligibility courses of study which are noncredit or remedial in nature (including courses in English language acquisition) which are determined by the eligible institution to be necessary to help the teacher candidate be prepared for the pursuit of a first undergraduate baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate degree or certificate or, in the case of courses in English language instruction, to be necessary to enable the teacher candidate to utilize already existing knowledge, training, or skills. Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the teacher candidate is enrolled.</p>
