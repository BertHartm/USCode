<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program authority and method of distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, during the period beginning July 1, 1972, and ending September 30, 1998, pay to each eligible institution such sums as may be necessary to pay to each eligible student (defined in accordance with section 1091 of this title) for each academic year during which that student is in attendance at an institution of higher education, as an undergraduate, a basic grant in the amount for which that student is eligible, as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Not less than 85 percent of such sums shall be advanced to eligible institutions prior to the start of each payment period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the institution as needed to pay eligible students, except that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to place an institution on a reimbursement system of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to students, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an amount for which they are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:209 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Basic grants made under this subpart shall be known as &ldquo;Federal Pell Grants&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose and amount of grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of this subpart is to provide a basic grant that in combination with reasonable family and student contribution and supplemented by the programs authorized under subparts 3 and 4 of this part, will meet at least 75 percent of a student's cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title), unless the institution determines that a greater amount of assistance would better serve the purposes of section 1070&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1070a_1_target" name="1070a_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the basic grant for a student eligible under this part shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $3,700 for academic year 1993&ndash;1994,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $3,900 for academic year 1994&ndash;1995,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) $4,100 for academic year 1995&ndash;1996,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) $4,300 for academic year 1996&ndash;1997, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) $4,500 for academic year 1997&ndash;1998,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the expected family contribution with respect to that student for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where a student attends an institution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (including a student who attends an institution of higher education on less than a half-time basis) during any academic year, the amount of the basic grant to which that student is entitled shall be reduced in proportion to the degree to which that student is not so attending on a full-time basis, in accordance with a schedule of reductions established by the Secretary for the purposes of this division, computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For any academic year for which an appropriation Act provides a maximum basic grant in an amount in excess of $2,400, the amount of a student's basic grant shall equal $2,400 plus&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) one-half of the amount by which such maximum basic grant exceeds $2,400; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the remaining one-half of such excess; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the sum of the student's tuition and the student's allowance determined under subparagraph (B), if applicable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), a student's allowance is $750 if the student has dependent care expenses (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em>(8) of this title) or disability related expenses (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em>(9) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No basic grant under this subpart shall exceed the difference between the expected family contribution for a student and the cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title) at the institution at which that student is in attendance. If, with respect to any student, it is determined that the amount of a basic grant plus the amount of the expected family contribution for that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year, the amount of the basic grant shall be reduced until the combination of expected family contribution and the amount of the basic grant does not exceed the cost of attendance at such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No basic grant shall be awarded to a student under this subpart if the amount of that grant for that student as determined under this subsection for any academic year is less than $400, except that a student who is eligible for a basic grant that is equal to or greater than $200 but less than $400 shall be awarded a basic grant of $400.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive 2 Pell grants during a single award year, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the student is enrolled full-time in an associate or baccalaureate degree program of study that is 2 years or longer at an eligible institution that is computed in credit hours; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the student completes course work toward completion of an associate or baccalaureate degree that exceeds the requirements for a full academic year as defined by the institution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the Secretary shall allow the amount of the basic grant to be exceeded for students participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the institution at which the student is enrolled when the reasonable costs of such program are greater than the cost of attendance at the student's home institution, except that the amount of such basic grant in any fiscal year shall not exceed the grant level specified in the appropriate Appropriation Act for this subpart for such year. If the preceding sentence applies, the financial aid administrator at the home institution may use the cost of the study abroad program, rather than the home institution's cost, to determine the cost of attendance of the student.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) No basic grant shall be awarded under this subpart to any individual who is incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period of eligibility for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The period during which a student may receive basic grants shall be the period required for the completion of the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study being pursued by that student at the institution at which the student is in attendance except that any period during which the student is enrolled in a noncredit or remedial course of study as defined in paragraph (2) shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility courses of study which are noncredit or remedial in nature (including courses in English language instruction) which are determined by the institution to be necessary to help the student be prepared for the pursuit of a first undergraduate baccalaureate degree or certificate or, in the case of courses in English language instruction, to be necessary to enable the student to utilize already existing knowledge, training, or skills. Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the student is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No student is entitled to receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one in<!-- PDFPage:210 -->stitution or from the Secretary and an institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applications for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall from time to time set dates by which students shall file applications for basic grants under this subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each student desiring a basic grant for any year shall file an application therefor containing such information and assurances as the Secretary may deem necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out the functions and responsibilities of this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distribution of grants to students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments under this section shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary for such purpose, in such manner as will best accomplish the purpose of this section. Any disbursement allowed to be made by crediting the student's account shall be limited to tuition and fees and, in the case of institutionally owned housing, room and board. The student may elect to have the institution provide other such goods and services by crediting the student's account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Calculation of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart (including a central processor, if any, designated by the Secretary) shall, in a timely manner, furnish to the student financial aid administrator (at each institution of higher education which a student awarded a basic grant under this subpart is attending), as a part of its regular output document, the expected family contribution for each such student. Each such student financial aid administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) examine and assess the data used to calculate the expected family contribution of the student furnished pursuant to this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recalculate the expected family contribution of the student if there has been a change in circumstances of the student or in the data submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make the award to the student in the correct amount; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) after making such award report the corrected data to such contractor and to a central processor (if any) designated by the Secretary for a confirmation of the correct computation of amount of the expected family contribution for each such student.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a student receives an award under this subpart that, due to recalculation errors by the institution of higher education, is in excess of the amount which the student is entitled to receive under this subpart, such institution of higher education shall pay to the Secretary the amount of such excess unless such excess can be resolved in a subsequent disbursement to the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart shall for each academic year after academic year 1986&ndash;1987 prepare and submit a report to the Secretary on the correctness of the computations of amount of the expected family contribution, and on the accuracy of the questions on the application form under this subpart for the previous academic year for which the contractor is responsible. The Secretary shall transmit the report, together with the comments and recommendations of the Secretary, to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Insufficient appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, for any fiscal year, the funds appropriated for payments under this subpart are insufficient to satisfy fully all entitlements, as calculated under subsection (b) of this section (but at the maximum grant level specified in such appropriation), the Secretary shall promptly transmit a notice of such insufficiency to each House of the Congress, and identify in such notice the additional amount that would be required to be appropriated to satisfy fully all entitlements (as so calculated at such maximum grant level).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Use of excess funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by 15 percent or less, then all of the excess funds shall remain available for making payments under this subpart during the next succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by more than 15 percent, then all of such funds shall remain available for making such payments but payments may be made under this paragraph only with respect to entitlements for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Treatment of institutions and students under other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any institution of higher education which enters into an agreement with the Secretary to disburse to students attending that institution the amounts those students are eligible to receive under this subpart shall not be deemed, by virtue of such agreement, a contractor maintaining a system of records to accomplish a function of the Secretary. Recipients of Pell Grants shall not be considered to be individual grantees for purposes of subtitle D of title V of Public Law 100&ndash;690 [41 U.S.C. 701 et seq.].</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $5,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this subpart in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">an amount equal to 90 percent of the amount it received under this subsection in its second year of participation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) of this subsection, then the amount of the allocation to each such institution shall be ratably reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is more than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) but less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (2), then&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">From one-quarter of the remainder of the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1070b(b) of this title for any fiscal year (after making the allocations required by subsection (a) of this section), the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution an amount which bears the same ratio to such one-quarter as the amount the eligible institution receives for such fiscal year under subsection (a) of this section bears to the amount all such institutions receive under such subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of excess based on fair share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From three-quarters of the remainder of the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1070b(b) of this title for each year (after making the allocations required by subsection (a) of this section), the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which has an excess eligible amount an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as such excess eligible amount bears to the sum of the excess eligible amounts of all such eligible institutions (having such excess eligible amounts).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For any eligible institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the amount of that institution's need (as determined under subsection (d) of this section), divided by (ii) the sum of the need of all institutions (as so determined), multiplied by (iii) the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1070b(b) of this title of the fiscal year; exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of institution's need</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To determine the need of an institution's eligible undergraduate students, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish various income categories for dependent and independent undergraduate students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish an expected family contribution for each income category of dependent and independent undergraduate students, determined on the basis of the average expected family contribution (computed in accordance with part E of this subchapter) of a representative sample within each income category for the second preceding fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) compute 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) multiply the number of eligible dependent students in each income category by 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C), minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) for each income category of dependent students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) multiply the number of eligible independent students in each income category by 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C), minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (F) for each income category of independent students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) add the amounts determined under subparagraphs (E) and (G).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;average cost of attendance&rdquo; means the average of the attendance costs for undergraduate students, which shall include (i) tuition and fees determined in accordance with subparagraph (B), (ii) standard living expenses determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), and (iii) books and supplies determined in accordance with subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The average undergraduate tuition and fees described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be <!-- PDFPage:233 -->computed on the basis of information reported by the institution to the Secretary, which shall include (i) total revenue received by the institution from undergraduate tuition and fees for the second year preceding the year for which it is applying for an allocation, and (ii) the institution's enrollment for such second preceding year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The standard living expense described in subparagraph (A)(ii) is equal to 150 percent of the difference between the income protection allowance for a family of five with one in college and the income protection allowance for a family of six with one in college for a single independent student.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The allowance for books and supplies described in subparagraph (A)(iii) is equal to $450.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reallocation of excess allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an institution returns to the Secretary any portion of the sums allocated to such institution under this section for any fiscal year the Secretary shall, in accordance with regulations, reallocate such excess to other institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If under paragraph (1) of this subsection an institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation, the institution's allocation for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount returned. The Secretary may waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that enforcing this paragraph would be contrary to the interest of the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Filing deadlines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, from time to time, set dates before which institutions must file applications for allocations under this part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of this subsection, the number of students who are deemed eligible in a State for participation in the grant program authorized by this subpart, and the number of such students in all the States, shall be determined for the most recent year for which satisfactory data are available.</p>

The total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount reallotted to a State under this part during a year from funds appropriated pursuant to section 1070c(b)(1) of this title shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such year.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Submission and contents of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State which desires to obtain a payment under this subpart for any fiscal year shall submit annually an application therefor through the State agency administering its program under this subpart as of July 1, 1985, unless the Governor of that State so designates, in writing, a different agency to administer the program. The application shall contain such information as may be required by, or pursuant to, regulation for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to make the determinations required under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of Federal share of grants made by qualified program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From a State's allotment under this subpart for any fiscal year the Secretary is authorized to make payments to such State for paying up <!-- PDFPage:235 -->to 50 percent of the amount of student grants pursuant to a State program which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is administered by a single State agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides that such grants will be in amounts not in excess of $5,000 per academic year (A) for attendance on a full-time basis at an institution of higher education, and (B) for campus-based community service work learning study jobs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not more than 20 percent of the allotment to the State for each fiscal year may be used for the purpose described in paragraph (2)(B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) grants for the campus-based community work learning study jobs may be made only to students who are otherwise eligible for assistance under this subpart; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) grants for such jobs be made in accordance with the provisions of section 2753(b)(1) of title 42;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provides for the selection of recipients of such grants or of such State work-study jobs on the basis of substantial financial need determined annually on the basis of criteria established by the State and approved by the Secretary, except that for the purpose of collecting data to make such determination of financial need, no student or parent shall be charged a fee that is payable to an entity other than such State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provides that, effective with respect to any academic year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, all nonprofit institutions of higher education in the State are eligible to participate in the State program, except in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of the constitution of the State or in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of a statute of the State which was enacted prior to October 1, 1978;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provides for the payment of the non-Federal portion of such grants or of such work-study jobs from funds supplied by such State which represent an additional expenditure for such year by such State for grants or work-study jobs for students attending institutions of higher education over the amount expended by such State for such grants or work-study jobs, if any, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such State initially received funds under this subpart;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provides that if the State's allocation under this subpart is based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students who are independent students or attending the institution less than full time, a reasonable proportion of the State's allocation shall be made available to such students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) provides for State expenditures under such program of an amount not less than the average annual aggregate expenditures for the preceding three fiscal years or the average annual expenditure per full-time equivalent student for such years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provides (A) for such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure proper disbursement of and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State agency under this subpart, and (B) for the making of such reports, in such form and containing such information, as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform his functions under this subpart; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) for any academic year beginning after June 30, 1987, provides the non-Federal share of the amount of student grants or work-study jobs under this subpart through a direct appropriation of State funds for the program under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reservation and disbursement of allotments and reallotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon his approval of any application for a payment under this subpart, the Secretary shall reserve from the applicable allotment (including any applicable reallotment) available therefor, the amount of such payment, which (subject to the limits of such allotment or reallotment) shall be equal to the Federal share of the cost of the students&rsquo; incentive grants or work-study jobs covered by such application. The Secretary shall pay such reserved amount, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may amend the reservation of any amount under this section, either upon approval of an amendment of the application or upon revision of the estimated cost of the student grants or work-study jobs with respect to which such reservation was made. If the Secretary approves an upward revision of such estimated cost, the Secretary may reserve the Federal share of the added cost only from the applicable allotment (or reallotment) available at the time of such approval.</p>
