<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) language-minority Americans speak virtually all world languages plus many that are indigenous to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there are large and growing numbers of children and youth of limited-English proficiency, many of whom have a cultural heritage that differs from that of their English-proficient peers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the presence of language-minority Americans is related in part to Federal immigration policies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) many language-minority Americans are limited in their English proficiency, and many have limited education and income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) limited English proficient children and youth face a number of challenges in receiving an education that will enable such children and youth to participate fully in American society, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) segregated education programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) disproportionate and improper placement in special education and other special programs due to the use of inappropriate evaluation procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the limited-English proficiency of their own parents, which hinders the parents&rsquo; ability to fully participate in the education of their children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a shortage of teachers and other staff who are professionally trained and qualified to serve such children and youth;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Native Americans and Native American languages (as such terms are defined in section 2902 of title 25), including native residents of the outlying areas, have a unique status under Federal law that requires special policies within the broad purposes of this chapter to serve the education needs of language minority students in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) institutions of higher education can assist in preparing teachers, administrators and other school personnel to understand and build upon the educational strengths and needs of language-minority and culturally diverse student enrollments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) it is the purpose of this subchapter to help ensure that limited English proficient students master English and develop high levels of academic attainment in content areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) quality bilingual education programs enable children and youth to learn English and meet high academic standards including proficiency in more than one language;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) as the world becomes increasingly interdependent and as international communication becomes a daily occurrence in government, business, commerce, and family life, multilingual skills constitute an important national resource which deserves protection and development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) educational technology has the potential for improving the education of language-minority and limited English proficient students and their families, and the Federal Government should foster this development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) parent and community participation in bilingual education programs contributes to program effectiveness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) research, evaluation, and data-collection capabilities in the field of bilingual education need to be strengthened so that educators and other staff can better identify and promote those programs, program implementation strategies, and instructional practices that result in effective education of limited English proficient children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the use of a child or youth's native language and culture in classroom instruction can&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) promote self-esteem and contribute to academic achievement and learning English by limited English proficient children and youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) benefit English-proficient children and youth who also participate in such programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) develop our Nation's national language resources, thus promoting our Nation's competitiveness in the global economy;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) the Federal Government, as exemplified by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.] and section 1703(f) of this title, has a special and continuing obligation to ensure that States and local school districts take appropriate action to provide equal educational opportunities to children and youth of limited English proficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) the Federal Government also, as exemplified by the Federal Government's efforts under this subchapter, has a special and continuing obligation to assist States and local school districts in developing the capacity to provide programs of instruction that offer limited English proficient children and youth an equal educational opportunity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares it to be the policy of the United States, in order to ensure equal educational opportunity for all children and youth and to promote educational excellence, to assist State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education and community-based organizations to build their capacity to establish, implement, and sustain programs of instruction for children and youth of limited English proficiency.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1151 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this part is to educate limited English proficient children and youth to meet the same rigorous standards for academic performance expected of all children and youth, including meeting challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards in academic areas by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) developing systemic improvement and reform of educational programs serving limited English proficient students through the development and implementation of exemplary bilingual education programs and special alternative instruction programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) developing bilingual skills and multicultural understanding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) developing the English of such children and youth and, to the extent possible, the native language skills of such children and youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) providing similar assistance to Native Americans with certain modifications relative to the unique status of Native American languages under Federal law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) developing data collection and dissemination, research, materials development, and technical assistance which is focused on school improvement for limited English proficient students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) developing programs which strengthen and improve the professional training of educational personnel who work with limited English proficient students.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Foreign language proficiency is crucial to our Nation's economic competitiveness and national security. Significant improvement in the quantity and quality of foreign language instruction offered in our Nation's elementary and secondary schools is necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All Americans need a global perspective. To understand the world around us, we must acquaint ourselves with the languages, cultures, and history of other nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Proficiency in two or more languages should be promoted for all American students. Multilingualism enhances cognitive and social growth, competitiveness in the global marketplace, national security, and understanding of diverse people and cultures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States lags behind other developed countries in offering foreign language study to elementary and secondary school students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Four out of five new jobs in the United States are created from foreign trade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The optimum time to begin learning a second language is in elementary school, when children have the ability to learn and excel in several foreign language acquisition skills, including pronunciation, and when children are most open to appreciating and valuing a culture other than their own.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Foreign language study can increase childrens&rsquo; capacity for critical and creative thinking skills and children who study a second language show greater cognitive development in areas such as mental flexibility, creativity, tolerance, and higher order thinking skills.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Children who have studied a foreign language in elementary school achieve expected gains and score higher on standardized tests of reading, language arts, and mathematics than children who have not studied a foreign language.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this section, make payments to State educational agencies for each of the fiscal years 1995 through 1999 for the purpose set forth in section 7541(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, of the amount appropriated for each fiscal year for this part, each State participating in the program assisted under this part shall receive an allocation equal to the proportion of such State's number of immigrant children and youth who are enrolled in public elementary or secondary schools under the jurisdiction of each local educational agency described in paragraph (2) within such State, and in nonpublic elementary or secondary schools within the district served by each such local educational agency, relative to the total number of immigrant children and youth so enrolled in all the States participating in the program assisted under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible local educational agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The local educational agencies referred to in paragraph (1) are those local educational agencies in which the sum of the number of immigrant children and youth who are enrolled in public elementary or secondary schools under the jurisdiction of such agencies, and in nonpublic elementary or secondary schools within the districts served by such agencies, during the fiscal year for which the payments are to be made under this part, is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at least 500; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at least 3 percent of the total number of students enrolled in such public or nonpublic schools during such fiscal year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">whichever number is less.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determinations of number of children and youth</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Determinations by the Secretary under this section for any period with respect to the number of immigrant children and youth shall be made on the basis of data or estimates provided to the Secretary by each State educational agency in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing to the affected State educational agency, that such data or estimates are clearly erroneous.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No such determination with respect to the number of immigrant children and youth shall operate because of an underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of the allocation under this section that such State would otherwise have received had such determination been made on the basis of accurate data.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary determines that any amount of a payment made to a State under this part for a fiscal year will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the payment was made, the Secretary shall make such amount available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from any appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this part, be regarded as part of such State's payment (as determined under subsection (b) of this section) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reservation of funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if the amount appropriated to carry out this part exceeds $50,000,000 for a fiscal year, a State educational agency may reserve not more than 20 percent of such agency's payment under this part for such year to award grants, on a competitive basis, to local educational agencies within the State as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) At least one-half of such grants shall be made available to eligible local educational agencies (as described in subsection (b)(2) of this section) within the State with the highest numbers and percentages of immigrant children and youth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Funds reserved under this paragraph and not made available under subparagraph (A) may be distributed to local educational agencies within the State experiencing a sudden influx of immigrant children and youth which are otherwise not eligible for assistance under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of grant funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each local educational agency receiving a grant under paragraph (1) shall use such grant funds to carry out the activities described in section 7547 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Local educational agencies with the highest number of immigrant children and youth receiving funds under paragraph (1) may make information available on serving immigrant children and youth to local educational agencies in the State with sparse numbers of such children.</p>
