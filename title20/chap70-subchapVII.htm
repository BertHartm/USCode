<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13096. American Indian and Alaska Native Education</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13096, Aug. 6, 1998, 63 F.R. 42681, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in affirmation of the unique political and legal relationship of the Federal Government with tribal governments, and in recognition of the unique educational and culturally related academic needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Goals</em>. The Federal Government has a special, historic responsibility for the education of American Indian and Alaska Native students. Improving educational achievement and academic progress for American Indian and Alaska Native students is vital to the national goal of preparing every student for responsible citizenship, continued learning, and productive employment. The Federal Government is committed to improving the academic performance and reducing the dropout rate of American Indian and Alaska Native students. To help fulfill this commitment in a manner consistent with tribal traditions and cultures, Federal agencies need to focus special attention on six goals: (1) improving reading and mathematics; (2) increasing high school completion and postsecondary attendance rates; (3) reducing the influence of long-standing factors that impede educational performance, such as poverty and substance abuse; (4) creating strong, safe, and drug-free school environments; (5) improving science education; and (6) expanding the use of educational technology.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Strategy</em>. In order to meet the six goals of this order, a comprehensive Federal response is needed to address the fragmentation of government services available to American Indian and Alaska Native students and the complexity of intergovernmental relationships affecting the education of those students. The purpose of the Federal activities described in this order is to develop a long-term, comprehensive Federal Indian education policy that will accomplish those goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Interagency Task Force</em>. There is established an Interagency Task Force on American Indian and Alaska Native Education (Task Force) to oversee the planning and implementation of this order. The Task Force shall confer with the National Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE) in carrying out activities under this order. The Task Force shall consult with representatives of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and organizations, including the National Indian Education Association (NIEA) and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), to gather advice on implementation of the activities called for in this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Composition of the Task Force</em>. (1) The membership of the Task Force shall include representatives of the Departments of the Treasury, Defense, Justice, the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, and Education, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Corporation for National and Community Service, and the National Science Foundation. With the agreement of the Secretaries of Education and the Interior, other agencies may participate in the activities of the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each participating agency shall designate a senior official who is responsible for management or program administration to serve as a member of the Task Force. The official shall report directly to the agency head on the agency's activities under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education of the Department of Education and the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior shall co-chair the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Interagency plan</em>. The Task Force shall, within 90 days of the date of this order, develop a Federal interagency plan with recommendations identifying initiatives, strategies, and ideas for future interagency action supportive of the goals of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Agency participation</em>. To the extent consistent with law and agency priorities, each participating agency shall adopt and implement strategies to maximize the availability of the agency's education-related programs, activities, resources, information, and technical assistance to American Indian and Alaska Native students. In keeping with the spirit of the Executive Memorandum of April 29, 1994 [25 U.S.C. 450 note], on Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments and Executive Order 13084 of May 14, 1998 [former 25 U.S.C. 450 note], each participating agency shall consult with tribal governments on their education-related needs and priorities, and on how the agency can better accomplish the goals of this order. Within 6 months, each participating agency shall report to the Task Force regarding the strategies it has developed to ensure such consultation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) <em>Interagency resource guide</em>. The Task Force shall identify, within participating Federal agencies, all education-related programs and resources that support the goals of this order. Within 12 months, the Task Force, in conjunction with the Department of Education, shall develop, publish, and widely distribute a guide that describes those programs and resources and how American Indians and Alaska Natives can benefit from them.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) <em>Research</em>. The Secretary of Education, through the Office of Educational Research and Improvement and the Office of Indian Education, and in consultation with NACIE and participating agencies, shall develop and implement a comprehensive Federal research agenda to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) establish baseline data on academic achievement and retention of American Indian and Alaska Native students in order to monitor improvements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) evaluate promising practices used with those students; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) evaluate the role of native language and culture in the development of educational strategies. Within 1 year, the Secretary of Education shall submit the research agenda, including proposed timelines, to the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) <em>Comprehensive Federal Indian education policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The Task Force shall, within 2 years of the date of this order, develop a comprehensive Federal Indian education policy to support the accomplishment of the goals of this order. The policy shall be designed to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) improve Federal interagency cooperation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) promote intergovernmental collaboration; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) assist tribal governments in meeting the unique educational needs of their children, including the need to preserve, revitalize, and use native languages and cultural traditions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) In developing the policy, the Task Force shall consider ideas in the Comprehensive Federal Indian Education Policy Statement proposal developed by the NIEA and the NCAI.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The Task Force shall develop recommendations to implement the policy, including ideas for future interagency action.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) As appropriate, participating agencies may develop memoranda of agreement with one another to enable and enhance the ability of tribes and schools to provide, and to coordinate the delivery of, Federal, tribal, State, and local resources and services, including social and health-related services, to meet the educational needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) <em>Reports</em>. The Task Force co-chairs shall submit the comprehensive Federal Indian education policy, and report annually on the agencies&rsquo; activities, accomplishments, and progress toward meeting the goals of this order, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Regional partnership forums</em>. The Departments of Education and the Interior, in collaboration with the Task Force and Federal, tribal, State, and local government representatives, shall jointly convene, within 18 months, a series of regional forums to identify promising practices and approaches on how to share information, provide assistance to schools, develop partner<!-- PDFPage:1305 -->ships, and coordinate intergovernmental strategies supportive of accomplishing the goals of this order. The Departments of Education and the Interior shall submit a report on the forums to the Task Force, which may include recommendations relating to intergovernmental relations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>School pilot sites</em>. The Departments of Education and the Interior shall identify a reasonable number of schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and public schools that can serve as a model for schools with American Indian and Alaska Native students, and provide them with comprehensive technical assistance in support of the goals of this order. A special team of technical assistance providers, including Federal staff, shall provide assistance to these schools. Special attention shall be given, where appropriate, to assistance in implementing comprehensive school reform demonstration programs that meet the criteria for those programs established by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public Law 105&ndash;78) [see Tables for classification], and to providing comprehensive service delivery that connects and uses diverse Federal agency resources. The team shall disseminate effective and promising practices of the school pilot sites to other local educational agencies. The team shall report to the Task Force on its accomplishments and its recommendations for improving technical support to local educational agencies and schools funded by the BIA.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Administration</em>. The Department of Education shall provide appropriate administrative services and staff support to the Task Force. With the consent of the Department of Education, other participating agencies may provide administrative support to the Task Force, consistent with their statutory authority, and may detail agency employees to the Department of Education, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Termination</em>. The Task Force established under section 2 of this order shall terminate not later than 5 years from the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>General provisions</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person. This order is not intended to preclude, supersede, replace, or otherwise dilute any other Executive order relating to American Indian and Alaska Native education.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments taken into account by the State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not make a grant under this subpart to a local educational agency for a fiscal year if, for such fiscal year, the State in which the local educational agency is located takes into consideration payments made under this chapter&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7428_1_target" name="7428_1">1</a></sup> in determining the eligibility of the local educational agency for State aid, or the amount of the State aid, with respect to the free public education of children during such fiscal year or the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not pay a local educational agency the full amount of a grant award determined under section 7423 of this title for any fiscal year unless the State educational agency notifies the Secretary, and the Secretary determines, that with respect to the provision of free public education by the local educational agency for the preceding fiscal year, the combined fiscal effort of the local educational agency and the State, computed on either a per student or aggregate expenditure basis, was not less than 90 percent of the amount of the combined fiscal effort, computed on the same basis, for the second preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (1) for a local educational agency, for not more than 1 year at a time, if the Secretary determines that the failure to comply with such requirement is due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the agency's financial resources.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Future determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall not use the reduced amount of the agency's expenditures for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which a waiver is granted to determine compliance with paragraph (1) for any succeeding fiscal year, but shall use the amount of expenditures that would have been required to comply with paragraph (1) in the absence of the waiver.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7512. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was organized as a nation and internationally recognized as a nation by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and navigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous people in Hawaii in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawaii.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom of Hawaii to govern friendship, commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally recognized, and indigenous government of Hawaii, the Kingdom of Hawaii, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, including United States citizens, who were assisted in their efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. Because of the participation of United States agents and citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in 1993 the United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination through Public Law 103&ndash;150 (107 Stat. 1510).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled &ldquo;Joint Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States&rdquo;, approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of Hawaii, including the government and crown lands of the former Kingdom of Hawaii, to the United States, but mandated that revenue generated from the lands be used &ldquo;solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, and in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: &ldquo;One thing that impressed me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was the fact that the natives of the island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in poverty.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b&ndash;1, 392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit fishing in the area &ldquo;only by native Hawaiian residents of said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their guidance.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Under the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union&rdquo;, approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments to such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union&rdquo;, the United States also ceded to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands formerly held by the United States, but mandated that such lands be held by the State &ldquo;in public trust&rdquo; and reaffirmed the special relationship that existed between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the legal responsibility to enforce the public trust responsibility of the State of Hawaii for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but <!-- PDFPage:1323 -->because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to the State of Hawaii;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United States have&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal affairs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-governance that has never been extinguished.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) The political relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the inclusion of Native Hawaiians in&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Education to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native Hawaiian education. The report, entitled the &ldquo;Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Project&rdquo;, was released in 1983 and documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests, were disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics indicative of special educational needs, and had educational needs that were related to their unique cultural situation, such as different learning styles and low self-image.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) In recognition of the educational needs of Native Hawaiians, in 1988, Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988 (102 Stat. 130) to authorize and develop supplemental educational programs to address the unique conditions of Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) In 1993, the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate released a 10-year update of findings of the Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the successes of the programs established under title IV of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the same educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians. Subsequent reports by the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate and other organizations have generally confirmed those findings. For example&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) educational risk factors continue to start even before birth for many Native Hawaiian children, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) late or no prenatal care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) high rates of births by Native Hawaiian women who are unmarried; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) high rates of births to teenage parents;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their school experience lagging behind other students in terms of readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score below national norms on standardized education achievement tests at all grade levels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) both public and private schools continue to show a pattern of lower percentages of Native Hawaiian students in the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be overrepresented among students qualifying for special education programs provided to students with learning disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional impairment, and other such disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepresented in institutions of higher education and among adults who have completed four or more years of college;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Native Hawaiians continue to be disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics indicative of special educational needs, as demonstrated by the fact that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be retained in grade level and to be excessively absent in secondary school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Native Hawaiian students have the highest rates of drug and alcohol use in the State of Hawaii; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Native Hawaiian children continue to be disproportionately victimized by child abuse and neglect; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 percent of the students served by the State of Hawaii Department of Education, and there are and will continue to be geographically rural, isolated areas with a high Native Hawaiian population density.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) In the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress, Hawaiian fourth-graders ranked 39th among groups of students from 39 States in reading. Given that Hawaiian students rank among the lowest groups of students nationally in reading, and that Native Hawaiian students rank the lowest among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative that greater focus be placed on beginning reading and early education and literacy in Hawaii.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1324 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) The findings described in paragraphs (16) and (17) are inconsistent with the high rates of literacy and integration of traditional culture and Western education historically achieved by Native Hawaiians through a Hawaiian language-based public school system established in 1840 by Kamehameha III.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) Following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893, Hawaiian medium schools were banned. After annexation, throughout the territorial and statehood period of Hawaii, and until 1986, use of the Hawaiian language as an instructional medium in education in public schools was declared unlawful. The declaration caused incalculable harm to a culture that placed a very high value on the power of language, as exemplified in the traditional saying: &ldquo;I ka &ldquo;&#333;lelo n&#333; ke ola; I ka &ldquo;&#333;lelo n&#333; ka make. In the language rests life; In the language rests death.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) Despite the consequences of over 100 years of nonindigenous influence, the Native Hawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory and their cultural identity in accordance with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) The State of Hawaii, in the constitution and statutes of the State of Hawaii&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reaffirms and protects the unique right of the Native Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their culture and religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) recognizes the traditional language of the Native Hawaiian people as an official language of the State of Hawaii, which may be used as the language of instruction for all subjects and grades in the public school system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promotes the study of the Hawaiian culture, language, and history by providing a Hawaiian education program and using community expertise as a suitable and essential means to further the program.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The attainment of educational success is critical to the betterment of the conditions, long-term well-being, and preservation of the culture of Alaska Natives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage the maximum participation by Alaska Natives in the planning and the management of Alaska Native education programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Alaska Native children enter and exit school with serious educational handicaps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The educational achievement of Alaska Native children is far below national norms. Native performance on standardized tests is low, Native student dropout rates are high, and Natives are significantly underrepresented among holders of baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska. As a result, Native students are being denied their opportunity to become full participants in society by grade school and high school educations that are condemning an entire generation to an underclass status and a life of limited choices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The programs authorized in this part, combined with expanded Head Start, infant learning, and early childhood education programs, and parent education programs, are es<!-- PDFPage:1329 -->sential if educational handicaps are to be overcome.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic barriers to be overcome in delivering educational services in rural Alaska and Alaska villages should be addressed through the development and implementation of innovative, model programs in a variety of areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Native children should be afforded the opportunity to begin their formal education on a par with their non-Native peers. The Federal Government should lend support to efforts developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for all students.</p>
