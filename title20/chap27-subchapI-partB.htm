<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) because more than one-half of all first-time first-year students attending postsecondary institutions attend community or junior colleges, and because almost one-half of minority students enrolled in higher education attend 2-year institutions, community and junior colleges represent a substantial and an important educational resource;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) declining participation rates for low-income students and minorities at institutions of higher education is of growing concern to the higher education community and Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is growing awareness of the need to assist low-income, minority and other nontraditional students in bridging the gap between 2-year to 4-year institutions, enabling such students to reach their individual potential, as well as contribute to the larger society.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this part is to improve the educational opportunities of this Nation's postsecondary students by creating comprehensive articulation agreements and planning between partnerships of 2-year and 4-year institutions of higher education.</p>
