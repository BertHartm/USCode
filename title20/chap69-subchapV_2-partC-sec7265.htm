<p class="note-body">Section 7264 of this title, referred to in text, was in the original &ldquo;section 5304&rdquo;, meaning section 5304 of Pub. L. 89  10, which was translated as reading section 5404 of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 89 10 does not contain a section 5304, but does contain a section 5404 relating to applications for grants under this part.</p>
