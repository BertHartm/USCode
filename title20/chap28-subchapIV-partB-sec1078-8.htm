<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of amount of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) of this section shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loan limits</h4>

At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Repayment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of calculating the repayment period under section 1078(b)(9) of this title, such period shall commence at the time the first payment of principal is due from the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Qualification for forbearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A lender may grant the borrower of a loan under this section a forbearance for a period not to exceed 60 days if the lender reasonably determines that such a forbearance from collection activity is warranted following a borrower's request for forbearance, deferment, or a change in repayment plan, or a request to consolidate loans in order to collect or process appropriate supporting documentation related to the request. During any such period, interest on the loan shall accrue but not be capitalized.</p>
