<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the State provides the Secretary of Labor with documentation of the necessity for the waiver, including information concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the specific requirement that will be waived;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the process that will be used to monitor the progress of the State or local partnership in implementing the waiver; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) such other information as the Secretary of Labor may require;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the State waives, or agrees to waive, similar requirements of State law; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:997 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) if the State&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides, to the extent feasible, to students, parents, advocacy and civil rights groups, and labor and business organizations an opportunity to comment on the proposal of the State to seek a waiver; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Approval or disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Labor shall promptly approve or disapprove any request submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) and shall issue a decision that shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include the reasons for approving or disapproving the request, including a response to comments on the proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a decision to approve the request, be disseminated by the State seeking the waiver to interested parties, including educators, parents, students, advocacy and civil rights organizations, labor and business organizations, and the public.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Approval criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In approving a request under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Labor shall consider the amount of State resources that will be used to implement the approved State plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Term</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each waiver approved pursuant to this subsection shall be for a period not to exceed 5 years, except that the Secretary of Labor may extend such period if the Secretary of Labor determines that the waiver has been effective in enabling the State or local partnership to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Waivers not authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Labor may not waive any requirement under any provision of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.),<sup><a href="#6213_1_target" name="6213_1">1</a></sup> or of any regulation issued under such provision, relating to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of waivers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Labor shall periodically review the performance of any State or local partnership for which the Secretary of Labor has granted a waiver under this section and shall terminate the waiver under this section if the Secretary of Labor determines that the performance of the State or local partnership affected by the waiver has been inadequate to justify a continuation of the waiver, or the State fails to waive similar requirements of State law as required or agreed to in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section.</p>
