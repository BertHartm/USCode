<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) all students can learn to high standards and must develop their talents and realize their potential if the United States is to prosper;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) gifted and talented students are a national resource vital to the future of the Nation and its security and well-being;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) too often schools fail to challenge students to do their best work, and students who are not challenged will not learn to challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards, fully develop their talents, and realize their potential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) unless the special abilities of gifted and talented students are recognized and developed during such students&rsquo; elementary and secondary school years, much of such students&rsquo; special potential for contributing to the national interest is likely to be lost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) gifted and talented students from economically disadvantaged families and areas, and students of limited-English proficiency are at greatest risk of being unrecognized and of not being provided adequate or appropriate educational services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) State and local educational agencies and private nonprofit schools often lack the necessary specialized resources to plan and implement effective programs for the early identification of gifted and talented students and for the provision of educational services and programs appropriate to their special needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Federal Government can best carry out the limited but essential role of stimulating research and development and personnel training and providing a national focal point of information and technical assistance that is necessary to ensure that the Nation's schools are able to meet the special educational needs of gifted and talented students, and thereby serve a profound national interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the experience and knowledge gained in developing and implementing programs for gifted and talented students can and should be used as a basis to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) develop a rich and challenging curriculum for all students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide all students with important and challenging subject matter to study and encourage the habits of hard work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide financial assistance to State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and other public and private agencies and organizations, to initiate a coordinated program of research, demonstration projects, personnel training, and similar activities designed to build a nationwide capability in elementary and secondary schools to meet the special educational needs of gifted and talented students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the development of rich and challenging curricula for all students through the appropriate application and adaptation of materials and instructional methods developed under this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to supplement and make more effective the expenditure of State and local funds, for the education of gifted and talented students.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) enhancement of parent and student choices among public schools can assist in promoting comprehensive educational reform and give more students the opportunity to learn to challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards, if sufficiently diverse and high-quality choices, and genuine opportunities to take advantage of such choices, are available to all students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) useful examples of such choices can come from States and communities that experiment with methods of offering teachers and other educators, parents, and other members of the public the opportunity to design and implement new public schools and to transform existing public schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) charter schools are a mechanism for testing a variety of educational approaches and <!-- PDFPage:1240 -->should, therefore, be exempted from restrictive rules and regulations if the leadership of such schools commits to attaining specific and ambitious educational results for educationally disadvantaged students consistent with challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance standards for all students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) charter schools, as such schools have been implemented in a few States, can embody the necessary mixture of enhanced choice, exemption from restrictive regulations, and a focus on learning gains;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) charter schools, including charter schools that are schools-within-schools, can help reduce school size, which reduction can have a significant effect on student achievement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Federal Government should test, evaluate, and disseminate information on a variety of charter school models in order to help demonstrate the benefits of this promising educational reform; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) there is a strong documented need for cash-flow assistance to charter schools that are starting up, because State and local operating revenue streams are not immediately available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part to increase national understanding of the charter schools model by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) providing financial assistance for the planning, program design and initial implementation of charter schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) evaluating the effects of such schools, including the effects on students, student achievement, staff, and parents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) expanding the number of high-quality charter schools available to students across the Nation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) With local school budget cuts there are inadequate arts and cultural programs available for children and youth in schools, especially at the elementary school level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The arts promote progress in academic subjects as shown by research conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Children and youth who receive instruction in the arts and humanities, or who are involved in cultural activities, remain in school longer and are more successful than children who do not receive such instruction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Learning in the arts and humanities promotes progress in other academic subjects, and generates positive self-esteem and a greater sense of accomplishment in young people.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is a worthwhile goal to ensure that all students in America are prepared for responsible citizenship and that all students should have the opportunity to be involved in activities that promote and demonstrate good citizenship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is a worthwhile goal to ensure that America's educators have access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional skills.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Allen J. Ellender, a Senator from Louisiana and President pro tempore of the United States Senate, had a distinguished career in public service characterized by extraordinary energy and real concern for young people. Senator Ellender provided valuable support and encouragement to the Close Up Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit foundation promoting knowledge and understanding of the Federal Government among young people and educators. Therefore, it is a fitting and appropriate tribute to Senator Ellender to provide fellowships in his name to students of limited economic means, the teachers who work with such students, and older Americans, so that such students, teachers, and older Americans may participate in the programs supported by the Close Up Foundation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a local public school often serves as a center for the delivery of education and human resources for all members of a community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) public schools, primarily in rural and inner city communities, should collaborate with other public and nonprofit agencies and organizations, local businesses, educational entities (such as vocational and adult education programs, school-to-work programs, community colleges, and universities), recreational, cultural, and other community and human service entities, for the purpose of meeting the needs of, and expanding the opportunities available to, the residents of the communities served by such schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by using school facilities, equipment, and resources, communities can promote a more efficient use of public education facilities, especially in rural and inner city areas where limited financial resources have enhanced the necessity for local public schools to become social service centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the high technology, global economy of the 21st century will require lifelong learning to keep America's workforce competitive and successful, and local public schools should provide centers for lifelong learning and educational opportunities for individuals of all ages; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) 21st Century Community Learning Centers enable the entire community to develop an education strategy that addresses the educational needs of all members of local communities.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ability of the Nation's major urban public school systems to meet the Nation's educational goals will determine the country's economic competitiveness and academic standing in the world community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the quality of public education in the Nation's major urban areas has a direct effect on the economic development of the Nation's inner-cities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the success of urban public schools in boosting the achievement of its minority youth attending such schools will determine the ability of the Nation to close the gap between the &ldquo;haves and the have-nots&rdquo; in society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the cost to America's businesses to provide remedial education to high school graduates is approximately $21,000,000,000 per year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) approximately one-third of the Nation's workforce will be members of minority groups by the year 2000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) urban schools enroll a disproportionately large share of the Nation's poor and &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) urban schools enroll approximately one-third of the Nation's poor, 40 percent of the Nation's African American children, and 30 percent of the Nation's Hispanic youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) nearly 20 percent of the Nation's limited-English-proficient children and 15 percent of the Nation's disabled youth are enrolled in urban public schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the academic performance of students in the average inner-city public school system is below that of students in most other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) urban public school systems have higher dropout rates, more problems with health care, and less parental participation than other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) urban preschoolers have one-half the access to early childhood development programs as do other children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) shortages of teachers in urban public school systems are 2.5 times greater than such shortages in other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) declining numbers of urban minority high school graduates are pursuing postsecondary educational opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) urban public school systems have greater problems with teenage pregnancy, discipline, drug abuse, and gangs than do other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) 75 percent of urban public school buildings are over 25 years old, 33 percent of such buildings are over 50 years old, and such buildings are often in serious disrepair and create poor and demoralizing working and learning conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) solving the challenges facing our Nation's urban schools will require the concerted and collaborative efforts of all levels of government and all sectors of the community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Federal and State funding of urban public schools has not adequately reflected need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) Federal funding that is well-targeted, flexible, and accountable would contribute significantly to addressing the comprehensive needs of inner-city public schools.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the success of rural public schools in boosting the achievement of minority youth attending such schools will determine the ability of the Nation to close the gap between the haves and the have-nots in society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the academic performance of students in the average rural school system is below that of students in most other suburban school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the average age of rural public school buildings is more than 45 years old and such buildings are often in serious disrepair, creating poor and demoralizing working and learning conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) shortages of teachers for rural public school systems is greater than in other kinds of school systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) solving the challenges facing the Nation's rural public schools will require the concerted and collaborative efforts of all levels of government and all sectors of the community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) additional Federal funding would contribute significantly to addressing the comprehensive needs of rural schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) rural public schools enroll a disproportionately large share of the Nation's poor and at-risk youth;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8331. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States faces a crisis in writing in schools and in the workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the writing problem has been magnified by the rapidly changing student populations and the growing number of at-risk students due to limited English proficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) over the past two decades, universities and colleges across the country have reported <!-- PDFPage:1264 -->increasing numbers of entering freshmen who are unable to write at a level equal to the demands of college work;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) American businesses and corporations are concerned about the limited writing skills of entry-level workers, and a growing number of executives are reporting that advancement was denied to them due to inadequate writing abilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the writing problem has been magnified by the rapidly changing student populations in the Nation's schools and the growing number of students who are at risk because of limited English proficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) writing and reading are both fundamental to learning, yet writing has been historically neglected in the schools and colleges, and most teachers in the United States elementary schools, secondary schools, and colleges have not been trained to teach writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) since 1973, the only national program to address the writing problem in the Nation's schools has been the National Writing Project, a network of collaborative university-school programs whose goal is to improve the quality of student writing and the teaching of writing at all grade levels and to extend the uses of writing as a learning process through all disciplines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the National Writing Project offers summer and school year inservice teacher training programs and a dissemination network to inform and teach teachers of developments in the field of writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the National Writing Project is a nationally recognized and honored nonprofit organization that recognizes that there are teachers in every region of the country who have developed successful methods for teaching writing and that such teachers can be trained and encouraged to train other teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the National Writing Project has become a model for programs to improve teaching in such other fields as mathematics, science, history, literature, performing arts, and foreign languages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the National Writing Project teacher-teaching-teachers program identifies and promotes what is working in the classrooms of the Nation's best teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the National Writing Project teacher-teaching-teachers project is a positive program that celebrates good teaching practices and good teachers and through its work with schools increases the Nation's corps of successful classroom teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) evaluations of the National Writing Project document the positive impact the project has had on improving the teaching of writing, student performance, and student thinking and learning ability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the National Writing Project programs offer career-long education to teachers, and teachers participating in the National Writing Project receive graduate academic credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) each year over 100,000 teachers voluntarily seek training in National Writing Project intensive summer institutes and workshops and school year in-service programs through one of the 154 regional sites located in 45 States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and in 4 sites that serve United States teachers in United States dependent and independent schools;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) 250 National Writing Project sites are needed to establish regional sites to serve all teachers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) private foundation resources, although generous in the past, are inadequate to fund all of the National Writing Project sites needed and the future of the program is in jeopardy without secure financial support;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) independent evaluation studies have found the National Writing Project to be highly cost effective compared to other professional development programs for teachers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) during 1991, the first year of Federal support for the National Writing Project, the National Writing Project matched the $1,951,975 in Federal support with $9,485,504 in matching funds from State, local, and other sources.</p>
