<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Subgrants to State agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State agency described in section 6431 of this title (other than an agency in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) is eligible to receive a subgrant under this subpart, for each fiscal year, in an amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of neglected or delinquent children and youth described in section 6431 of this title who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are enrolled for at least 15 hours per week in education programs in adult correctional institutions; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1281 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are enrolled for at least 20 hours per week&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in education programs in institutions for neglected or delinquent children and youth; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in community day programs for neglected or delinquent children and youth; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in the State, except that the amount determined under this subparagraph shall not be less than 32 percent, nor more than 48 percent, of the average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The number of neglected or delinquent children and youth determined under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be determined by the State agency by a deadline set by the Secretary, except that no State agency shall be required to determine the number of such children and youth on a specific date set by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be adjusted, as the Secretary determines is appropriate, to reflect the relative length of such agency's annual programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subgrants to State agencies in Puerto Rico</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each fiscal year, the amount of the subgrant which a State agency in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be eligible to receive under this subpart shall be the amount determined by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage which the average per-pupil expenditure in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is of the lowest average per-pupil expenditure of any of the 50 States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 32 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The percentage in paragraph (1)(A) shall not be less than&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the application of paragraph (2) would result in any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia receiving less under this subpart than it received under this subpart for the preceding fiscal year, then the percentage described in paragraph (1)(A) that is used for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for the fiscal year for which the determination is made shall be the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage in paragraph (1)(A) for such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the percentage used for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Ratable reductions in case of insufficient appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year for subgrants under subsections (a) and (b) of this section is insufficient to pay the full amount for which all State agencies are eligible under such subsections, the Secretary shall ratably reduce each such amount.</p>
