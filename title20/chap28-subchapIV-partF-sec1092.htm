<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary, in conjunction with the National Junior College Athletic Association, shall develop and obtain data on completion or graduation rates from two-year colleges that award athletically related student aid. Such data shall, to the extent practicable, be consistent with the reporting requirements set forth in this section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 360B(b) of Pub. L. 103&ndash;382 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) participation in athletic pursuits plays an important role in teaching young Americans how to work on teams, handle challenges and overcome obstacles;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) participation in athletic pursuits plays an important role in keeping the minds and bodies of young Americans healthy and physically fit;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) there is increasing concern among citizens, educators, and public officials regarding the athletic opportunities for young men and women at institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) a recent study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association found that in Division I&ndash;A institutions, only 20 percent of the average athletic department operations budget of $1,310,000 is spent on women's athletics; 15 percent of the average recruiting budget of $318,402 is spent on recruiting female athletes; the average scholarship expenses for men is $1,300,000 and $505,246 for women; and an average of 143 grants are awarded to male athletes and 59 to women athletes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) female college athletes receive less than 18 percent of the athletics recruiting dollar and less than 24 percent of the athletics operating dollar;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) male college athletes receive approximately $179,000,000 more per year in athletic scholarship grants than female college athletes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) prospective students and prospective student athletes should be aware of the commitments of an institution to providing equitable athletic opportunities for its men and women students; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) knowledge of an institution's expenditures for women's and men's athletic programs would help prospective students and prospective student athletes make informed judgments about the commitments of a given institution of higher education to providing equitable athletic benefits to its men and women students.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 102 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;542 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) education is fundamental to the development of individual citizens and the progress of the Nation as a whole;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) there is increasing concern among citizens, educators, and public officials regarding the academic performance of students at institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) a recent study by the National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities found that just 43 percent of students attending 4-year public colleges and universities and 54 percent of students entering private institutions graduated within 6 years of enrolling;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the academic performance of student athletes, especially student athletes receiving football and basketball scholarships, has been a source of great concern in recent years;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) more than 10,000 athletic scholarships are provided annually by institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) prospective students and prospective student athletes should be aware of the educational commitments of an institution of higher education; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) knowledge of graduation rates would help prospective students and prospective student athletes make an informed judgment about the educational benefits available at a given institution of higher education.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 101&ndash;542, title II, &sect;202, Nov. 8, 1990, 104 Stat. 2384, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the reported incidence of crime, particularly violent crime, on some college campuses has steadily risen in recent years;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) although annual &lsquo;National Campus Violence Surveys&rsquo; indicate that roughly 80 percent of campus crimes are committed by a student upon another student and that approximately 95 percent of the campus crimes that are violent are alcohol- or drug-related, there are currently no comprehensive data on campus crimes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) out of 8,000 postsecondary institutions participating in Federal student aid programs, only 352 col<!-- PDFPage:617 -->leges and universities voluntarily provide crime statistics directly through the Uniform Crime Report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other institutions report data indirectly, through local police agencies or States, in a manner that does not permit campus statistics to be separated;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) several State legislatures have adopted or are considering legislation to require reporting of campus crime statistics and dissemination of security practices and procedures, but the bills are not uniform in their requirements and standards;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) students and employees of institutions of higher education should be aware of the incidence of crime on campus and policies and procedures to prevent crime or to report occurrences of crime;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) applicants for enrollment at a college or university, and their parents, should have access to information about the crime statistics of that institution and its security policies and procedures; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) while many institutions have established crime preventive measures to increase the safety of campuses, there is a clear need&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to encourage the development on all campuses of security policies and procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) for uniformity and consistency in the reporting of crimes on campus; and</p>
