<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Computation of payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b), (d), or (f) of this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of children who were in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding school year and who, while in attendance at such schools&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) resided on Federal property with a parent employed on Federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the school district of such agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) resided on Federal property with a parent who is an official of, and accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) resided on Federal property and had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined in section 101 of title 37);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) resided on Indian lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined by section 101 of title 37) but did not reside on Federal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) had a parent who is an official of, and has been accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer but did not reside on Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) resided in low-rent housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) resided on Federal property and is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) resided with a parent employed on Federal property situated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in whole or in part in the county in which such agency is located, or in whole or in part in such agency if such agency is located in more than one county; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if not in such county, in whole or in part in the same State as such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of weighted student units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 6,500; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 2,000 and such number equals or exceeds 15 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basic support payments and payments with respect to fiscal years in which insufficient funds are appropriated</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basic support payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at least 400 such children; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this subsection for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local <!-- PDFPage:1291 -->educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located, multiplied by the local contribution percentage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payments with respect to fiscal years in which insufficient funds are appropriated</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For any fiscal year in which the sums appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title are insufficient to pay to each local educational agency the full amount computed under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make payments in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Learning opportunity threshold payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall compute a learning opportunity threshold payment (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;threshold payment&rdquo;) by multiplying the amount obtained under paragraph (1)(C) by the total percentage obtained by adding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the percentage of federally connected children for each local educational agency determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of children described under subsection (a)(1) of this section and the denominator of which is the total number of children in average daily attendance at the schools served by such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the percentage that funds under paragraph (1)(C) represent of the total budget of the local educational agency, determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of funds calculated for each local educational agency under this paragraph (not including amounts received under subsection (f) of this section), and the denominator of which is the total current expenditures for such agency in the second preceding fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Such total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 100.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For the purpose of determining the percentages described in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) that are applicable to the local educational agency providing free public education to students in grades 9 through 12 residing on Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, the Secretary shall consider only that portion of such agency's total enrollment of students in grades 9 through 12 when calculating the percentage under such subclause (I) and only that portion of the total current expenditures attributed to the operation of grades 9 through 12 in such agency when calculating the percentage under subclause (II).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Ratable distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall make payments as a ratable distribution based upon the computation made under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prior year data</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (f) of this section, all calculations under this section shall be based on data for each local educational agency from not later than the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the agency is making application for payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Calculations for a local educational agency that is newly established by a State shall, for the first year of operation of such agency, be based on data from the fiscal year for which the agency is making application for payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Children with disabilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the amount appropriated under section 7714(c) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay to each eligible local educational agency, on a pro rata basis, the amounts determined by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) multiplying the number of children described in subparagraphs (A)(ii), (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section who are eligible to receive services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) by a factor of 1.0; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) multiplying the number of children described in subparagraph (D) of subsection (a)(1) of this section who are eligible to receive services under such Act by a factor of 0.5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency that receives funds under paragraph (1) shall use such funds to provide a free appropriate public education to children described in paragraph (1) in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Hold-harmless amounts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in paragraph (4)(A), the total amount that the Secretary shall pay a local educational agency under subsection (b) of this section shall not be less than 85 percent of the amount such agency received for the preceding fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of fiscal year 1995 only, under subsections (a) and (b) of section 3 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, or 1999, under such subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1292 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For fiscal year 1995 only, the Secretary shall pay, to each local educational agency that is not eligible for a payment under subsection (b) of this section but that received a payment under section 3 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such Act was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) for fiscal year 1994, an amount which is not less than 85 percent of the payment such agency received under such section 3 for fiscal year 1994.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local educational agency which received a payment under section 3(e) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) for fiscal year 1994 is eligible to receive a payment, under subsection (b) of this section for fiscal year 1995, in an amount which is not less than 85 percent of the amount received by such agency in fiscal year 1994 under such section 3(e).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Ratable reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) If necessary in order to make payments to local educational agencies in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary first shall ratably reduce payments under subsection (b) of this section to local educational agencies that do not receive a payment under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If additional funds become available for making payments under subsection (b) of this section for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under clause (i) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) If the sums made available under this subchapter for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that all local educational agencies in all States are eligible to receive under paragraphs (1) and (2) after the application of subparagraph (A) for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce payments to all such agencies for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If additional funds become available for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under clause (i) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional assistance for heavily impacted local educational agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From amounts appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide additional assistance to meet special circumstances relating to the provision of education in local educational agencies eligible to receive assistance under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A local educational agency is eligible to receive additional assistance under this subsection only if such agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i)(I) has an enrollment of federally connected children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section which constitutes a percentage of the total student enrollment of such agency which is not less than 50 percent if such agency receives a payment on behalf of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of such subsection, or not less than 40 percent if such agency does not receive a payment on behalf of such children; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is a local educational agency whose boundaries are the same as a Federal military installation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any local educational agency determined eligible under clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall be deemed to have met the tax effort requirements for eligibility under clause (i)(II) or (ii)(II) of such subparagraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the average per-pupil expenditure of generally comparable local edu<!-- PDFPage:1293 -->cational agencies located in the State of the local educational agency, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the average per-pupil expenditure of three generally comparable local educational agencies located in the State of the local educational agency, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The Secretary shall next subtract from the amount determined under clause (i) the average amount of State aid per pupil received by the local educational agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The Secretary shall next multiply the amount determined under clause (ii) by the total number of students in average daily attendance at the schools of the local educational agency as determined by the Secretary under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) If the tax rate used by the local educational agency is greater than 95 percent, but less than 100 percent, of the tax rate of comparable local educational agencies, the Secretary shall next multiply the amount determined under clause (iii) by the percentage that the tax rate of the local educational agency is of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the average tax rate of its generally comparable local educational agencies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the average tax rate of all the local educational agencies in the State in which the local educational agency is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) The Secretary shall next subtract the total amount of payments received by a local educational agency under subsections (b) and (d) of this section for a fiscal year from the amount determined under clause (iii) or clause (iv), as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to payments under this subsection for a local educational agency described in clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (2)(A), the maximum amount of such payments shall be computed by taking the product of the average per-pupil expenditure in all States multiplied by 0.7, except that such amount may not exceed 125 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in all local educational agencies in the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Current year data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, for purposes of providing assistance under this subsection, use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) student and revenue data from the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is applying for assistance under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the most recent data available which is adjusted to such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reduction in payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds appropriated to carry out this subsection are insufficient to pay in full the amounts determined under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall ratably reduce the payment to each eligible local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Additional payments for local educational agencies with high concentrations of children with severe disabilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any local educational agency receives Federal funds from sources other than this subchapter to carry out the purposes of this subchapter for any fiscal year due to the enrollment of children described under subsection (a) of this section, then the Secretary shall consider such funds as a payment to such agency under this subchapter<sup><a href="#7703_1_target" name="7703_1">1</a></sup> for such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if funds appropriated pursuant to section 7714(b) of this title for payments under subsection (b) of this section to such agency for a fiscal year which, when added to the funds described in paragraph (1) received by such agency for such fiscal year, exceed the maximum amount described under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section, then the Secretary shall make available from the funds appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for such fiscal year such excess amounts to any local educational agency serving two or more children described under subparagraph (B) or (D) of subsection (a)(1) of this section who have a severe disability and a parent serving in the uniformed services (as defined by section 101 of title 37) who is assigned to a particular permanent duty station for compassionate reasons (compassionate post assignment) for the total costs associated with such children who are provided an educational program provided outside the schools of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remaining funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If funds remain after payments are made under paragraph (2) for any fiscal year, then such remaining funds shall be made available for expenditures under subsection (d) of this section in such fiscal year on a pro rata basis consistent with the requirements of such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Ratable reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If amounts available to carry out paragraph (2) for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay in full the total payment that all eligible local educational agencies are eligible to receive under such paragraph for such year, then the Secretary shall ratably reduce such payments to such agencies for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Other funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a local educational agency receiving funds under this section may also receive funds under section 6 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress) (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994) or such section's successor authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Maintenance of effort</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A local educational agency may receive funds under subsection (b) of this section and section 7702 of this title for any fiscal year only if the <!-- PDFPage:1294 -->State educational agency finds that either the combined fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of that agency and the State with respect to the provision of free public education by that agency for the preceding fiscal year was not less than 90 percent of such combined fiscal effort or aggregate expenditures for the second preceding fiscal year.</p>
