<p class="statutory-body">The Board of Directors of the Association shall take or cause to be taken all such action as the Board of Directors deems necessary or appropriate to effect, upon the shareholder approval described in subsection (b) of this section, a restructuring of the common stock ownership of the Association, as set forth in a plan of reorganization adopted by the Board of Directors (the terms of which shall be consistent with this section) so that all of the outstanding common shares of the Association shall be directly owned by a Holding Company. Such actions may include, in the Board of Director's discretion, a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company with and into the Association, which would have the effect provided in the plan of reorganization and the law of the jurisdiction in which such subsidiary is incorporated. As part of the restructuring, the Board of Directors may cause&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the common shares of the Association to be converted, on the reorganization effective date, to common shares of the Holding Company on a one for one basis, consistent with applicable State or District of Columbia law; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Shareholder approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan of reorganization adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be submitted to common shareholders of the Association for their approval.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event the shareholders of the Association approve the plan of reorganization under subsection (b) of this section, the following provisions shall apply beginning on the reorganization effective date:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as specifically provided in this section, until the dissolution date the Association shall continue to have all of the rights, privileges and obligations set forth in, and shall be subject to all of the limitations and restrictions of, section 1087&ndash;2 of this title, and the Association shall continue to carry out the purposes of such section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association) shall not be entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and obligations, and shall not be subject to the limitations and restrictions, applicable to the Association under section 1087&ndash;2 of this title, except as specifically provided in this section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association or a subsidiary of the Association) shall not purchase loans insured under this chapter until such time as the Association ceases acquiring such loans, except that the Holding Company may purchase such loans if the Association is merely continuing to acquire loans as a lender of last resort pursuant to section 1087&ndash;2(q) of this title or under an agreement with the Secretary described in paragraph (6).</p>
