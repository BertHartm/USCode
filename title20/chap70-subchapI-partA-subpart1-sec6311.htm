<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State has developed or adopted challenging content standards and challenging student performance standards that will be used by the State, its local educational agencies, and its schools to carry out this part, except that a State shall not be required to submit such standards to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a State has State content standards or State student performance standards developed under title III&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6311_1_target" name="6311_1">1</a></sup> of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and an aligned set of assessments for all students developed under such title, or, if not developed under such title, adopted under another process, the State shall use such standards and assessments, modified, if necessary, to conform with the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (D) of this paragraph, and paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If a State has not adopted State content standards and State student performance standards for all students, the State plan shall include a strategy and schedule for developing State content standards and State student performance standards for elementary and secondary school children served under this part in subjects as determined by the State, but including at least mathematics and reading or language arts by the end of the one-year period described in paragraph (6), which standards shall include the same knowledge, skills, and levels of performance expected of all children.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) describe a third level of performance, partially proficient, to provide complete information about the progress of the lower performing children toward achieving to the proficient and advanced levels of performance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) For the subjects in which students will be served under this part, but for which a State is not required by subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to develop, and has not otherwise developed such standards, the State plan shall describe a strategy for ensuring that such students are taught the same knowledge and skills and held to the same expectations as are all children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Yearly progress</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that links progress primarily to performance on the assessments carried out under this section while permitting progress to be established in part through the use of other measures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State has developed or adopted a set of high-quality, yearly student assessments, including assessments in at least mathematics and reading or language arts, that will be used as the primary means of determining the yearly performance of each local educational agency and school served under this part in enabling all children served under this part to meet the State's student performance standards.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the inclusion of limited English proficient students who shall be assessed, to the extent practicable, in the language and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable information on what such students know and can do, to determine such students&rsquo; mastery of skills in subjects other than English;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) include students who have attended schools in a local educational agency for a full academic year but have not attended a single school for a full academic year, however the performance of students who have attended more than one school in the local educational agency in any academic year shall be used only in determining the progress of the local educational agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If a State does not have assessments that meet the requirements of paragraph (3) and proposes to develop such assessments under paragraph (6)(B), the State may propose to use a transitional set of yearly statewide assessments that will assess the performance of complex skills and challenging subject matter.</p>
