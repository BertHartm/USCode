<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in the State, except that the amount determined under this subparagraph shall not be less than 32 percent, or more than 48 percent, of the average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculation of grants</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Allocations to local educational agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall calculate grants under this section on the basis of the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for local educational agencies, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of those data are unreliable or that their use would be otherwise inappropriate, in which case&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the two Secretaries shall publicly disclose the reasons for their determination in detail; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) paragraph (3) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocations to large and small local educational agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For any fiscal year to which this paragraph applies, the Secretary shall calculate grants under this section for each local educational agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The amount of a grant under this section for each large local educational agency shall be the amount determined under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For small local educational agencies, the State educational agency may either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) distribute grants under this section in amounts determined by the Secretary under clause (i); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) If a small local educational agency is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State educational agency under clause (iii)(II), it may appeal that determination to the Secretary, who shall respond not later than 45 days after receipt of such appeal.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Direct allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, or for which the State believes it has data that would better target funds than allocating them by county, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority to make the allocations under this subpart for a particular fiscal year directly to local educational agencies without regard to counties.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Allocations to local educational agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary approves the State educational agency's application under subparagraph (B), the State educational agency shall provide the Secretary an assurance that such allocations shall be made&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Appeal</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the application of subparagraph (B) would result in any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia receiving less under this subpart than it received under this subpart for the preceding fiscal year, the percentage in subparagraph (A) shall be the greater of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for the preceding fiscal year; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum number of children to qualify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A local educational agency is eligible for a basic grant under this section for any fiscal year only if the number of children counted under subsection (c) of this section for that agency is both&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 10 or more; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) more than 2 percent of the total school-age population in the agency's jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Children to be counted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Categories of children</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, in the school district of such agency from families above the poverty level as determined under paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of number of children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data, described in paragraph (3), available from the Department of Commerce. The District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be treated as individual local educational agencies. If a local educational agency contains two or more counties in their entirety, then each county will be treated as if such county were a separate local educational agency for purposes of calculating grants under this part. The total of grants for such counties shall be allocated to such a local educational agency, which local educational agency shall distribute to schools in each county within such agency a share of the local educational agency's total grant that is no less than the county's share of the population counts used to calculate the local educational agency's grant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Population updates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In fiscal year 2002 and each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall use updated data on the number of children, aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level for counties or local educational agencies, published by the Department of Commerce, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that the use of the updated population data would be inappropriate or unreliable. If appropriate and reliable data are not available annually, the Secretary shall use data which are updated every 2 years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Inappropriate or unreliable data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of the data referred to in subparagraph (A) are inappropriate or unreliable, the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce shall publicly disclose their reasons.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Criteria of poverty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the families that are below the poverty level, the Secretary shall use <!-- PDFPage:1246 -->the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census, as the criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other children to be counted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For the purpose of this section, the Secretary shall determine the number of children aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families above the poverty level on the basis of the number of such children from families receiving an annual income, in excess of the current criteria of poverty, from payments under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]; and in making such determinations, the Secretary shall use the criteria of poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent decennial census for a family of four in such form as those criteria have been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall determine the number of such children and the number of children aged 5 through 17 living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, or being supported in foster homes with public funds, on the basis of the caseload data for the month of October of the preceding fiscal year (using, in the case of children described in the preceding sentence, the criteria of poverty and the form of such criteria required by such sentence which were determined for the calendar year preceding such month of October) or, to the extent that such data are not available to the Secretary before January of the calendar year in which the Secretary's determination is made, then on the basis of the most recent reliable data available to the Secretary at the time of such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Except for the data on children living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall collect and transmit the information required by this subparagraph to the Secretary not later than January 1 of each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For the purpose of this section, the Secretary shall consider all children who are in correctional institutions to be living in institutions for delinquent children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Estimate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When requested by the Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce shall make a special updated estimate of the number of children of such ages who are from families below the poverty level (as determined under paragraph (1)(A)) in each school district, and the Secretary is authorized to pay (either in advance or by way of reimbursement) the Secretary of Commerce the cost of making this special estimate. The Secretary of Commerce shall give consideration to any request of the chief executive of a State for the collection of additional census information.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6336. Adequacy of funding of targeted grants to local educational agencies in fiscal years after fiscal year 2001</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The current Basic Grant Formula for the distribution of funds under this part often does not provide funds for the economically disadvantaged students for which such funds are targeted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any school district in which more than 2 percent of the students live below the poverty level qualifies for funding under the Basic Grant Formula. As a result, 9 out of every 10 school districts in the country receive some form of aid under the Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Fifty-eight percent of all schools receive at least some funding under this part, including many suburban schools with predominantly well-off students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) One out of every 5 schools with concentrations of poor students between 50 and 75 percent receive no funding at all under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In passing the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, Congress declared that grants under this part would more sharply target high poverty schools by using the Targeted Grant Formula, but annual appropriation Acts have prevented the use of that Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The advantage of the Targeted Grant Formula over other funding formulas under this part is that the Targeted Grant Formula provides increased grants per poor child as the percentage of economically disadvantaged children in a school district increases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Studies have found that the poverty of a child's family is much more likely to be associated with educational disadvantage if the family lives in an area with large concentrations of poor families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) States with large populations of high poverty students would receive significantly more funding if more funds under this part were allocated through the Targeted Grant Formula.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Congress has an obligation to allocate funds under this part so that such funds will positively affect the largest number of economically disadvantaged students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on allocation of subchapter I funds contingent on adequate funding of targeted grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to section 6332 of this title, the total amount allocated in any fiscal year after fiscal year 2001 for programs and activities under this part shall not exceed the amount allocated in fiscal year 2001 for such programs and activities unless the amount available for targeted grants to local educational agencies under section 6335 of this title in the applicable fiscal year meets the requirements of section 6332(a) of this title.</p>
