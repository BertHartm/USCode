<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Senator Barry Goldwater of the State of Arizona has served his country for 56 years as a soldier and statesman, including service in the United States Senate for a period of 30 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Senator Goldwater has a distinguished record as a Senator, including service as Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and as Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Senator Goldwater has long maintained a special interest in the education of America's youth, particularly in the fields of science and mathematics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It would, therefore, be a fitting tribute to the leadership, courage, and vision of Senator Goldwater to establish in his name a scholarship program to foster and encourage excellence in science and mathematics.</p>
