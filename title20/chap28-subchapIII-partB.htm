<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the historically Black colleges and universities have contributed significantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity through postsecondary education for Black, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged Americans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) States and the Federal Government have discriminated in the allocation of land and financial resources to support Black public institutions under the Morrill Act of 1862 [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and its progeny, and against public and private Black colleges and universities in the award of Federal grants and contracts, and the distribution of Federal resources under this chapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and other Federal programs which benefit institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the current state of Black colleges and universities is partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action requires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary institutions to ensure their continuation and participation in fulfilling the Federal mission of equality of educational opportunity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) financial assistance to establish or strengthen the physical plants, financial management, academic resources, and endowments of the historically Black colleges and universities are appropriate methods to enhance these institutions and facilitate a decrease in reliance on governmental financial support and to encourage reliance on endowments and private sources.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to advance the development of the Nation's full human potential and to advance equal opportunity in higher education, strengthen the capacity of historically black colleges and universities to provide the highest quality education, increase opportunities for these institutions to participate in and benefit from Federal programs, and ensure that our Nation has the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by the year 2020, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have made historic and ongoing contributions to the general welfare and prosperity of our country. Established by visionary leaders, America's HBCUs, for over 150 years, have produced many of the Nation's leaders in business, government, academia, and the military and have provided generations of American men and women with hope and educational opportunity. The Nation's 105 HBCUs are located in 20 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and serve more than 300,000 undergraduate and graduate students. These institutions continue to be important engines of economic growth and community service, and they are proven ladders of intergenerational advancement for men and women of all ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds, especially African Americans. These institutions also produce a high number of baccalaureate recipients who go on to assume leadership and service roles in their communities and who successfully complete graduate and professional degree programs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>White House Initiative on HBCUs.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Establishment</em>. There is established the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Initiative), to be housed in the Department of Education (Department).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Mission and Functions</em>. The Initiative shall work with executive departments, agencies, and offices, the private sector, educational associations, philanthropic organizations, and other partners to increase the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education to a greater number of students, and to take advantage of these institutions&rsquo; capabilities in serving the Nation's needs through five core tasks:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) strengthening the capacity of HBCUs to participate in Federal programs;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) fostering enduring private-sector initiatives and public-private partnerships while promoting specific areas and centers of academic research and programmatic excellence throughout all HBCUs;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) improving the availability, dissemination, and quality of information concerning HBCUs to inform public policy and practice;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) sharing administrative and programmatic practices within the HBCU community for the benefit of all; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) exploring new ways of improving the relationship between the Federal Government and HBCUs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Administration</em>. There shall be an Executive Director of the Initiative. The Department shall provide the staff, resources, and assistance for the Initiative, and shall assist the Initiative in fulfilling its mission and responsibilities under this order.</p>

Where appropriate, each agency plan shall address, among other things, the agency's proposed efforts to:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) establish how the department or agency intends to increase the capacity of HBCUs to compete effectively for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements and to encourage HBCUs to participate in Federal programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) identify Federal programs and initiatives in which HBCUs may be either underserved or underused as national resources, and improve HBCUs&rsquo; participation therein; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) encourage public-sector, private-sector, and community involvement in improving the overall capacity of HBCUs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Each department and agency, in its agency plan, shall provide appropriate measurable objectives and, after the first year, shall annually assess that department's or agency's performance on the goals set in the previous year's agency plan.</p>

The Secretary and the Executive Director shall review the agency plans in consultation with the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs, established in section 3 of this order, and shall submit to the President an annual plan to strengthen the overall capacity of HBCUs.</p>

<p class="note-body">(v) encouraging public-private investments in HBCUs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Administration</em>. The Executive Director of the Initiative shall also serve as the Executive Director of the Board. The Department shall provide funding and administrative support for the Board to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. Members of the Board shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law.
