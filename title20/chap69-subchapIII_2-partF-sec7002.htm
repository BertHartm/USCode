<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount made available under subsection (a) of this section for a fiscal year is less than $50,000,000, then the Secretary shall award grants to States, on a competitive basis, taking into account such factors as age and condition of existing school library media collections and the relative economic need of the students to be served.</p>
