<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to purchase</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority; determination required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon a determination by the Secretary that there is an inadequate availability of loan capital to meet the demand for loans under sections 1078, 1078&ndash;2, or 1078&ndash;8 of this title, whether as a result of inadequate liquidity for such loans or for other reasons, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to purchase, or enter into forward commitments to purchase, from any eligible lender, as defined by section 1085(d)(1) of this title, loans first disbursed under sections 1078, 1078&ndash;2, or 1078&ndash;8 of this title on or after October 1, 2003, and before July 1, 2010, on such terms as the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget jointly determine are in the best interest of the United States, except that any purchase under this section shall not result in any net cost to the Federal Government (including the cost of servicing the loans purchased), as determined jointly by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Federal Register notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall jointly publish a notice in the Federal Register prior to any purchase of loans under this section that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) includes an outline of the methodology and factors that the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, will jointly consider in evaluating the price at which to purchase loans made under section 1078, 1078&ndash;2, or 1078&ndash;8 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) describes how the use of such methodology and consideration of such factors used to determine purchase price will ensure that loan purchases do not result in any net cost to the Federal Government (including the cost of servicing the loans purchased).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require, as a condition of any purchase under subsection (a), that the funds paid by the Secretary to any eligible lender under this section shall be used: (1) to ensure continued participation of such lender in the Federal student loan programs authorized under part B of this subchapter; and (2) to originate new Federal loans to students, as authorized under part B of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maintaining servicing arrangements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such servicing arrangement is in the best interest of the borrowers whose loans are purchased.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guaranty agency responsibilities and payments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the insurance issued by such agency pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title for such loan shall cease to be effective with respect to any default on such loan that occurs on or after the date of such purchase.</p>
