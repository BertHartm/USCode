<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) With local school budget cuts there are inadequate arts and cultural programs available for children and youth in schools, especially at the elementary school level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The arts promote progress in academic subjects as shown by research conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Children and youth who receive instruction in the arts and humanities, or who are involved in cultural activities, remain in school longer and are more successful than children who do not receive such instruction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Learning in the arts and humanities promotes progress in other academic subjects, and generates positive self-esteem and a greater sense of accomplishment in young people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) School-university and school-cultural institution partnerships that upgrade teacher training in the arts and humanities have significantly contributed to improved instruction and achievement levels of school-aged children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Museum outreach, cultural activities and informal education for at-risk children and youth have contributed significantly to the educational achievement and enhanced interest in learning of at-risk children and youth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The Goals 2000: Educate America Act [20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.], other legislation and local, State and national resources support the integration of the arts and humanities into the regular curriculum and school day for all children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) While all children benefit from instruction in the arts and the humanities, at-risk children and youth have a special, additional need for arts and cultural programs both in school and after school.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subpart is to make demonstration grants to eligible entities to improve the educational performance and future potential of at-risk children and youth by providing comprehensive and coordinated educational and cultural services.</p>
