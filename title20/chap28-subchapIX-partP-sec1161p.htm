<p class="statutory-body">From amounts appropriated to carry out this section, the Secretary shall award grants, on a competitive basis, to institutions of higher education, as defined in section 1001(a) of this title, to create workforce bridge programs between developmental courses and for-credit courses in occupational certificate programs that are articulated to degree programs. Such workforce bridge programs shall focus on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) improving developmental education, including English language instruction, by customizing developmental education to student career goals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) helping students move rapidly from developmental coursework into for-credit occupational courses and through program completion.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall give priority to applications that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) are from institutions of higher education in which not less than 50 percent of the institution's entering first-year students who are subject to mandatory assessment are assessed as needing developmental courses to bring reading, writing, or mathematics skills up to college level; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) propose to replicate practices that have proven effective with adults, or propose to collaborate with adult education providers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Required activity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An institution of higher education that receives a grant under this section shall use the grant funds to create workforce bridge programs to customize developmental education curricula, including English language instruction, to reflect the content of for-credit occupational certificate or degree programs, or clusters of such programs, in which developmental education students are enrolled or plan to enroll. Such workforce bridge programs shall integrate the curricula and the instruction of the developmental and college-level coursework.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Permissible activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An institution of higher education that receives a grant under this section may use the grant funds to carry out one or more of the following activities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Designing and implementing innovative ways to improve retention in and completion of developmental education courses, including enrolling students in cohorts, accelerating course content, dually enrolling students in developmental and college-level courses, tutoring, providing counseling and other supportive services, and giving small, material incentives for attendance and performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In consultation with faculty in the appropriate departments, reconfiguring courses offered on-site during standard academic terms for modular, compressed, or other alternative <!-- PDFPage:771 -->schedules, or for distance-learning formats, to meet the needs of working adults.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Developing counseling strategies that address the needs of students in remedial education courses, and including counseling students on career options and the range of programs available, such as certificate programs that are articulated to degree programs and programs designed to facilitate transfer to four-year institutions of higher education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Improving the quality of teaching in remedial courses through professional development, reclassification of such teaching positions, or other means the institution of higher education determines appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Any other activities the institution of higher education and the Secretary determine will promote retention of, and completion by, students attending institutions of higher education.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Grant period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Grants made under this section shall be for a period of not less than three years and not more than five years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Technical assistance</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Report and summary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each institution of higher education that receives a grant under this section shall report to the Secretary on the effectiveness of the program in enabling students to move rapidly from developmental coursework into for-credit occupational courses and through program completion.
