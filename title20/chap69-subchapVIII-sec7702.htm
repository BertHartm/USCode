<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) State law requires an assessment be made of property so acquired; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that such agency is not being substantially compensated for the loss in revenue resulting from such ownership by increases in revenue accruing to the agency from the conduct of Federal activities with respect to such Federal property,</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The amount that a local educational agency shall be paid under subsection (a) of this section for a fiscal year shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (2), except that such amount shall be reduced by the Secretary by an amount equal to the amount of revenue, if any, that such agency received during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on such Federal property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the amount of revenue that a local educational agency receives during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property shall not include payments received by the agency from the Secretary of Defense to support&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of aggregate assessed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such aggregate assessed value of such acquired Federal property shall be determined on the basis of the highest and best use of property adjacent to such acquired Federal property as of the time such value is determined, and provided to the Secretary, by the local official responsible for assessing the value of real property located in the jurisdiction of such local educational agency for the purpose of levying a property tax.</p>
