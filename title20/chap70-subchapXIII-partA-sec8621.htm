<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) develop, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, the Director of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs, and the Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement, a set of performance indicators that assesses whether the work of the centers assists in improving teaching and learning under this chapter for all children, particularly children at risk of educational failure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conduct surveys every two years of populations to be served under this chapter to determine if such populations are satisfied with the access to and quality of such services;</p>
