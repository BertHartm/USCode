<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose of and authority for advances to reserve funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose; eligible recipients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From sums appropriated pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4)(A) of section 1071(b) of this title, the Secretary is authorized to make advances to any State with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title for the purpose of helping to establish or strengthen the reserve fund of the student loan insurance program covered by that agreement. If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title, and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title in order to enable students in the State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such an agreement. The Secretary may make advances under this subsection both to a State program (with which he has such an agreement) and to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations (with which he has such an agreement) in that State if he determines that such advances are necessary in order that students in each eligible institution have access through such institution to a student loan insurance program which meets the requirements of section 1078(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Matching requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No advance shall be made after June 30, 1968, unless matched by an equal amount from non-Federal sources. Such equal amount may include the unencumbered non-Federal portion of a reserve fund. As used in the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;unencumbered non-Federal portion&rdquo; means the amount (determined as of the time immediately preceding the making of the advance) of the reserve fund less the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) advances made under this section prior to July 1, 1968;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an amount equal to twice the amount of advances made under this section after June 30, 1968, and before the advance for purposes of which the determination is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proceeds of earnings on advances made under this section; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount which is required to be maintained in such fund pursuant to State law or regulation, or by agreement with lenders, as a reserve against the insurance of outstanding loans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Except as provided in section 1078(c)(10)(E)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1072_1_target" name="1072_1">1</a></sup> or (F) of this title, such unencumbered non-Federal portion shall not be subject to recall, repayment, or recovery by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms and conditions; repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Advances pursuant to this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions (including conditions relating to the time or times of payment) consistent with the requirements of section 1078(b) of this title as the Secretary determines will best carry out the purpose of this section. Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate in each case in the light of the maturity and solvency of the reserve fund for which the advance was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on total advances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The Secretary shall pay this portion of the interest to the holder of the loan on behalf of and for the account of the borrower at such times as may be specified in regulations in force when the applicable agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (b) of this section was made, or, if the loan was made by a State or is insured under a program which is not covered by such an agreement, at such times as may be specified in regulations in force at the time the loan was paid to the student.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the Secretary determines that subsection (d) of this section does not make such statutory limitation inapplicable and that such statutory limitation threatens to impede the carrying out of the purpose of this part,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Parents of a dependent student, who do not have an adverse credit history as determined pursuant to regulations of the Secretary, shall be eligible to borrow funds under this section in amounts specified in subsection (b) of this section, and unless otherwise specified in subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section, such loans shall have the same terms, conditions, and benefits as all other loans made under this part. Whenever necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, the terms &ldquo;student&rdquo; and &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; as used in this part shall include a parent borrower under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation based on need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any loan under this section may be counted as part of the expected family contribution in the determination of need under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, but no loan may be made to any parent under this section for any academic year in excess of (A) the student's estimated cost of attendance, minus (B) other financial aid as certified by the eligible institution under section 1078(a)(2)(A) of this title. The annual insurable limit on account of any student shall not be deemed to be exceeded by a line of credit under which actual payments to the borrower will not be made in any year in excess of the annual limit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) PLUS loan disbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All loans made under this section shall be disbursed in accordance with the requirements of section 1078&ndash;7 of this title and shall be disbursed by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an electronic transfer of funds from the lender to the eligible institution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a check copayable to the eligible institution and the parent borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of principal and interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commencement of repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Repayment of principal on loans made under this section shall commence not later than 60 days after the date such loan is disbursed by the lender, subject to deferral during any period during which the parent meets the conditions required for a deferral under section 1077(a)(2)(C) or 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Capitalization of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest on loans made under this section for which payments of principal are deferred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, if agreed upon by the borrower and the lender (A) be paid monthly or quarterly, or (B) be added to the principal amount of the loan not more frequently than quarterly by the lender. <!-- PDFPage:315 -->Such capitalization of interest shall not be deemed to exceed the annual insurable limit on account of the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsidies prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No payments to reduce interest costs shall be paid pursuant to section 1078(a) of this title on loans made pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicable rates of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest on loans made pursuant to this section shall be at the applicable rate of interest provided in section 1077a(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the periodic payment and the repayment schedule for any loan made pursuant to this section shall be established by assuming an interest rate equal to the applicable rate of interest at the time the repayment of the principal amount of the loan commences. At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Refinancing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Refinancing to secure combined payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An eligible lender may at any time consolidate loans held by it which are made under this section to a borrower, including loans which were made under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, under a single repayment schedule which provides for a single principal payment and a single payment of interest, and shall calculate the repayment period for each included loan from the date of the commencement of repayment of the most recent included loan. Unless the consolidated loan is obtained by a borrower who is electing to obtain variable interest under paragraph (2) or (3), such consolidated loan shall bear interest at the weighted average of the rates of all included loans. The extension of any repayment period of an included loan pursuant to this paragraph shall be reported (if required by them) to the Secretary or guaranty agency insuring the loan, as the case may be, but no additional insurance premiums shall be payable with respect to any such extension. The extension of the repayment period of any included loan shall not require the formal extension of the promissory note evidencing the included loan or the execution of a new promissory note, but shall be treated as an administrative forbearance of the repayment terms of the included loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Refinancing to secure variable interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An eligible lender may reissue a loan which was made under this section before July 1, 1987, or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, in order to permit the borrower to obtain the interest rate provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title. A lender offering to reissue a loan or loans for such purpose may charge a borrower an amount not to exceed $100 to cover the administrative costs of reissuing such loan or loans, not more than one-half of which shall be paid to the guarantor of the loan being reissued to cover costs of reissuance. Reissuance of a loan under this paragraph shall not affect any insurance applicable with respect to the loan, and no additional insurance fee may be charged to the borrower with respect to the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refinancing by discharge of previous loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A borrower who has applied to an original lender for reissuance of a loan under paragraph (2) and who is denied such reissuance may obtain a loan from another lender for the purpose of discharging the loan from such original lender. A loan made for such purpose&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall bear interest at the applicable rate of interest provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall not result in the extension of the duration of the note (other than as permitted under subsection (c)(5)(B) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may be subject to an additional insurance fee but shall not be subject to the administrative cost charge permitted by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall be applied to discharge the borrower from any remaining obligation to the original lender with respect to the original loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certification in lieu of promissory note presentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each new lender may accept certification from the original lender of the borrower's original loan in lieu of presentation of the original promissory note.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notification to borrowers of availability of refinancing options</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each holder of a loan made under this section or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, shall, not later than October 1, 1987, in the case of loans made before October 17, 1986, notify the borrower of such loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) of the refinancing options for which the borrower is eligible under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) of those options which will be made available by the holder and of the practical consequences of such options in terms of interest rates and monthly and total payments for a set of loan examples; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that, with respect to any option that the holder will not make available, the holder will, to the extent practicable, refer the borrower to an eligible lender offering such option.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Other repayment incentives</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sale of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each guaranty agency shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary which shall provide that upon securing consecutive payments for 12 months of amounts owed on a loan for which the Secretary has made a payment under paragraph (1) of section 1078(c) of this title, the guaranty agency (pursuant to an <!-- PDFPage:323 -->agreement with the Secretary) or the Secretary shall, if practicable, sell the loan to an eligible lender. Such loan shall not be sold to an eligible lender who has been found by the guaranty agency or the Secretary to have substantially failed to exercise the due diligence required of lenders under this part. Neither the guaranty agency nor the Secretary shall demand from a borrower as monthly payment amounts referred to in this paragraph more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An agreement between the guaranty agency and the Secretary for purposes of this paragraph shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the repayment by the agency to the Secretary of 81.5 percent of the amount of the principal balance outstanding at the time of such sale, multiplied by the reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the guaranty agreement was made with respect to the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for the reinstatement by the Secretary (I) of the obligation to reimburse such agency for the amount expended by it in discharge of its insurance obligation under its loan insurance program, and (II) of the obligation to pay to the holder of such loan a special allowance pursuant to section 1087&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A loan which does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) may also be eligible for sale under this paragraph upon a determination that the loan was in default due to clerical or data processing error and would not, in the absence of such error, be in a delinquent status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of proceeds of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts received by the Secretary pursuant to the sale of such loans by a guaranty agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be deducted from the calculations of the amount of reimbursement for which the agency is eligible under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection for the fiscal year in which the amount was received, notwithstanding the fact that the default occurred in a prior fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Borrower eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any borrower whose loan is sold under paragraph (1) shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional loans or grants under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (for which he or she is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such loan sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability of general loan conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan which is sold under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, so long as the borrower continues to make scheduled repayments thereon, be subject to the same terms and conditions and qualify for the same benefits and privileges as other loans made under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each guaranty agency shall establish a program which allows a borrower with a defaulted loan or loans to renew eligibility for all title IV student financial assistance (regardless of whether the defaulted loan has been sold to an eligible lender) upon the borrower's payment of 6 consecutive monthly payments. The guaranty agency shall not demand from a borrower as a monthly payment amount under this subsection more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. A borrower may only obtain the benefit of this subsection with respect to renewed eligibility once.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of amount of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) of this section shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loan limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the annual and aggregate limits for loans under this section shall be the same as those established under section 1078(b)(1) of this title, less any amount received by such student pursuant to the subsidized loan program established under section 1078 of this title.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a student at an eligible institution who has successfully completed such first and second years but has not successfully completed the remainder of a program of undergraduate education&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) $5,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such student is enrolled in a program of undergraduate education, the remainder of which is less than one academic year, the maximum annual loan amount that such student may receive may not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount specified in subclause (I) as such remainder measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours bears to one academic year;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of such a student who is a graduate or professional student attending an eligible institution, $10,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Aggregate limits for independent, graduate, and professional students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The maximum aggregate amount of loans under this section a student described in paragraph (2) may borrow shall be the amount described in paragraph (1), adjusted to reflect the increased annual limits described in paragraph (2), as prescribed by the Secretary by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of principal and interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commencement of repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Repayment of principal on loans made under this section shall begin at the beginning of the repayment period described in section 1078(b)(7) of this title. Not less than 30 days prior to the anticipated commencement of such repayment period, the holder of such loan shall provide notice to the borrower that interest will accrue before repayment begins and of the borrower's option to begin loan repayment at an earlier date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Capitalization of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest on loans made under this section for which payments of principal are not required during the in-school and grace periods or for which payments are deferred under sections 1077(a)(2)(C) and 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title shall, if agreed upon by the borrower and the lender (A) be paid monthly or quarterly, or (B) be added to the principal amount of the loan not more frequently than quarterly by the lender. Such capitalization of interest shall not be deemed to exceed the annual insurable limit on account of the student.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsidies prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No payments to reduce interest costs shall be paid pursuant to section 1078(a) of this title on loans made pursuant to this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the periodic payment and the repayment schedule for any loan made pursuant to this section shall be established by assuming an interest rate equal to the applicable rate of interest at the time the repayment of the principal amount of the loan commences. At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Repayment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of calculating the 10-year repayment period under section 1078(b)(1)(D) of this title, such period shall commence at the time the first payment of principal is due from the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Origination fee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of origination fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lender shall charge the borrower an origination fee in the amount of 3.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan, to be deducted proportionately from each installment payment of the proceeds of the loan prior to payment to the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Relation to applicable interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such origination fee shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining compliance with section 1077a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disclosure required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lender shall disclose to the borrower the amount and method of calculating the origination fee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of origination fee to offset default costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each lender making loans under this section shall transmit all origination fees authorized to be collected from borrowers to the Secretary, who shall use such fees to pay the Federal costs of default claims paid for loans under this section and to reduce the cost of special allowances paid thereon, if any, under section 1087&ndash;1(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of origination fee and insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In fiscal year 1995, the Secretary is directed to analyze the risk rates of borrowers who have participated in this program in the 2 previous fiscal years. If the Secretary finds, that as a result of this review, the projected defaults and special allowance costs of the unsubsidized program do not exceed the combined origination fee under this subsection and the insurance premium under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary is directed to lower the origination fee and insurance premium accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Single application form and loan repayment schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A guaranty agency shall use a single application form and a single repayment schedule for <!-- PDFPage:327 -->subsidized Federal Stafford loans made pursuant to section 1078 of this title and for unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans made pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State or nonprofit private institution or organization having an agreement with the Secretary under section 1078(b)(1) of this title may charge a borrower under this section an insurance premium equal to not more than 1.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan, if such premium will not be used for incentive payments to lenders.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Designation of lenders, servicers, and guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary determines that an eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency has a compliance performance rating that equals or exceeds 97 percent, the Secretary shall designate the eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency, as the case may be, for exceptional performance. The Secretary shall notify each appropriate guaranty agency of the eligible lenders and servicers designated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance performance rating</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a compliance performance rating is determined with respect to compliance with due diligence in the collection of loans under this part for each year for which the determination is made. Such rating is equal to the percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary by regulation, with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) loans serviced during the period by the eligible lender or servicer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) loans on which loan collection was attempted by the guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment to lenders and servicers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) 100 percent payment rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay each eligible lender or servicer (as agent for an eligible lender) designated under subsection (a) of this section 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest of all loans for which claims are submitted for payment by that eligible lender or servicer for the one-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under this section or until the guaranty agency receives notice from the Secretary that the designation of the lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section has been revoked.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall revoke the designation of a lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section if any quarterly audit required under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not received by the Secretary by the date established by the Secretary or if the audit indicates the lender or servicer failed to maintain 97 percent or higher compliance with program regulations, as reflected in the performance of not less than 97 percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary for the purpose of this section, for 2 consecutive months or 90 percent for 1 month.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit the authority of guaranty agencies to require the submission of claims documentation evidencing servicing performed on loans, except that the guaranty agency may not require greater documentation than that required for lenders and servicers not designated under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payments to guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall pay to each guaranty agency designated under subsection (a) of this section the appropriate percentage under this subsection for the 1-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

The standards shall measure the lender's or servicer's compliance with the due diligence standards and shall include a defined statistical sampling technique designed to measure the performance rating of the eligible lender or servicer for the purpose of this section. Each eligible lender or servicer shall submit the audit required by this section to the Secretary and to each appropriate guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional information on lenders and servicers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each appropriate guaranty agency shall provide the Secretary with such other information in its possession regarding an eligible lender or servicer desiring designation as may relate to the Secretary's determination under subsection (a) of this section, including but not limited to any information suggesting that the application of a lender or servicer for designation under subsection (a) of this section should not be approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section, such other information as provided by any guaranty agency under paragraph (2), and any information in the possession of the Secretary or submitted by any other agency or office of the Federal Government. If the results of the audit are not persuasively rebutted by such other information, the Secretary shall inform the eligible lender or servicer and the appropriate guaranty agency that its application for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer has been approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cost of audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible lender or servicer shall pay for all the costs of the audits required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Compliance audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to maintain its status as an exceptional eligible lender or servicer, the lender or servicer shall undergo a quarterly compliance audit at the end of each quarter (other than the quarter in which status as an exceptional <!-- PDFPage:329 -->lender or servicer is established through a financial and compliance audit, as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section), and submit the results of such audit to the Secretary and such appropriate guaranty agency. The compliance audit will review compliance with due diligence requirements for the period since the last audit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Loss of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the audit performed pursuant to paragraph (5) fails to meet the standards for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the lender or servicer shall lose its designation as an exceptional lender or servicer. A lender or servicer receiving a compliance audit not meeting the standard for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer may reapply for designation under subsection (a) of this section at any time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Due diligence standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Due diligence standards used for determining compliance under paragraph (5) shall be promulgated by the Secretary after consultation with lenders, guaranty agencies and servicers and shall consist of a list of specific elements for the Federal regulations selected to provide an indication of systems degradation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Additional revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, designation under subsection (a) of this section may be revoked at any time by the Secretary if the Secretary determines that the eligible lender or servicer has failed to maintain an overall level of regulatory compliance consistent with the audit submitted by the eligible lender or servicer under this section or if the Secretary believes the lender or servicer may have engaged in fraud in securing designation under subsection (a) of this section or is failing to service loans in accordance with program regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of designated guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Audit of guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency desiring a designation under subsection (a) of this section shall have a financial and compliance audit of the defaulted loan portfolio of such guaranty agency conducted annually by a qualified independent organization or person from a list of qualified organizations or persons promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General and the Secretary. The standards shall include defined statistical sampling techniques designed to measure the performance rating of the guaranty agency for the purpose of this section. Each guaranty agency shall submit the audit required by this paragraph to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quarterly sample audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may require quarterly sample audits as a means of determining continued qualification of the guaranty agency for designation as an exceptional guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section and other information in his possession.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Costs of audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay for all of the costs of the audits regulated by this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation for fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may revoke the designation of a guaranty agency under subsection (a) of this section at any time if the Secretary has reason to believe the guaranty agency secured its designation under subsection (a) of this section through fraud or fails to comply with applicable regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Revocation based on performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Designation as an exceptional guaranty agency may be revoked at any time by the Secretary upon 30 days notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary upon a finding by the Secretary that the guaranty agency has failed to maintain an acceptable overall level of regulatory compliance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursements made by the Secretary on loans submitted for claim by an eligible lender or loan servicer designated for exceptional performance under this section shall not be subject to additional review by the Secretary or repurchase by the guaranty agency for any reason other than a determination by the Secretary that the eligible lender, loan servicer, or guaranty agency engaged in fraud or other purposeful misconduct in obtaining designation for exceptional performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the processing of claims on student loans of eligible lenders not subject to this paragraph.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loan-by-loan insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to issue certificates on application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, upon application by an eligible lender, made upon such form, containing such information, and supported by such evidence as the Secretary may require, and otherwise in conformity with this section, the Secretary finds that the applicant has made a loan to an eligible student which is insurable under the provisions of this part, he may issue to the applicant a certificate of insurance covering the loan and setting forth the amount and terms of the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effectiveness of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall become effective upon the date of issuance of the certificate, except that the Secretary is authorized, in accordance with regulations, to issue commitments with respect to proposed loans, or with respect to lines (or proposed lines) of credit, submitted by eligible lenders, and in that event, upon compliance with subsection (a)(1) of this section by the lender, the certificate of insurance may be issued effective as of the date when any loan, or any payment by the lender pursuant to a line of credit, to be covered by such insurance was made. Such insurance shall cease to be effective upon 60 days&rsquo; default by the lender in the payment of any installment of the premiums payable pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contents of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An application submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall contain (A) an agreement by the applicant to pay, in accordance with regulations, the premiums fixed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and (B) an agreement by the applicant that if the loan is covered by insurance the applicant will submit such supplementary reports and statement during the effective period of the loan agreement, upon such forms, at such times, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe by or pursuant to regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Comprehensive insurance coverage certificate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of system by regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of requiring a separate insurance application and issuing a separate certificate of insurance for each student loan made by an eligible lender as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations consistent with section 1074 of this title, issue to any eligible lender applying therefor a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage which shall, without further action by the Secretary, insure all insurable loans made by that lender, on or after the date of the certificate and before a specified cutoff date, within the limits of an aggregate maximum amount stated in the certificate. Such regulations may provide for conditioning such insurance, with respect to any loan, upon compliance by the lender with such requirements (to be stated or incorporated by reference in the certificate) as in the Secretary's judgment will best achieve the purpose of this subsection while protecting the United States from the risk of unreasonable loss and promoting the objectives of this part, including (but not limited to) provisions as to the reporting of such loans and information relevant thereto to the Secretary and as to the payment of initial and other premiums and the effect of default therein, and including provision for confirmation by the Secretary from time to time (through endorsement of the certificate) of the coverage of specific new loans by such certificate, which confirmation shall be incontest<!-- PDFPage:333 -->able by the Secretary in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation of fact or patent error.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uncovered loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the holder of a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage issued under this subsection grants to a student a line of credit extending beyond the cutoff date specified in that certificate, loans or payments thereon made by the holder after that date pursuant to the line of credit shall not be deemed to be included in the coverage of that certificate except as may be specifically provided therein; but, subject to the limitations of section 1074 of this title, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations, make commitments to insure such future loans or payments, and such commitments may be honored either as provided in subsection (a) of this section or by inclusion of such insurance on comprehensive coverage under the subsection for the period or periods in which such future loans or payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Charges for Federal insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, pursuant to regulations, charge for insurance on each loan under this part a premium in an amount not to exceed one-fourth of 1 percent per year of the unpaid principal amount of such loan (excluding interest added to principal), payable in advance, at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations may provide that such premium shall not be payable, or if paid shall be refundable, with respect to any period after default in the payment of principal or interest or after the borrower has died or becomes totally and permanently disabled, if (1) notice of such default or other event has been duly given, and (2) requests for payment of the loss insured against has been made or the Secretary has made such payment on his own motion pursuant to section 1080(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignability of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rights of an eligible lender arising under insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance issued to it under this section may be assigned as security by such lender only to another eligible lender, and subject to regulation by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consolidation not to affect insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The consolidation of the obligations of two or more federally insured loans obtained by a student borrower in any fiscal year into a single obligation evidenced by a single instrument of indebtedness shall not affect the insurance by the United States. If the loans thus consolidated are covered by separate certificates of insurance issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may upon surrender of the original certificates issue a new certificate of insurance in accordance with that subsection upon the consolidated obligation; if they are covered by a single comprehensive certificate issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may amend that certificate accordingly.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1080. Default of student under Federal loan insurance program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to Secretary and payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon default by the student borrower on any loan covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant to this part, and prior to the commencement of suit or other enforcement proceedings upon security for that loan, the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the Secretary, and the Secretary shall if requested (at that time or after further collection efforts) by the beneficiary, or may on the Secretary's own motion, if the insurance is still in effect, pay to the beneficiary the amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan as soon as that amount has been determined. The &ldquo;amount of the loss&rdquo; on any loan shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the principal amount and accrued interest, including interest accruing from the date of submission of a valid default claim (as determined by the Secretary) to the date on which payment is authorized by the Secretary, reduced to the extent required by section 1075(b) of this title. Such beneficiary shall be required to meet the standards of due diligence in the collection of the loan and shall be required to submit proof that reasonable attempts were made to locate the borrower (when the location of the borrower is unknown) and proof that contact was made with the borrower (when the location is known). The Secretary shall make the determination required to carry out the provisions of this section not later than 90 days after the notification by the insurance beneficiary and shall make payment in full on the amount of the beneficiary's loss pending completion of the due diligence investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon payment of the amount of the loss pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated for all of the rights of the holder of the obligation upon the insured loan and shall be entitled to an assignment of the note or other evidence of the insured loan by the insurance beneficiary. If the net recovery made by the Secretary on a loan after deduction of the cost of that recovery (including reasonable administrative costs and collection costs, to the extent set forth in regulations issued by the Secretary) exceeds the amount of the loss, the excess shall be paid over to the insured. The Secretary may, in attempting to make recovery on such loans, contract with private business concerns, State student loan insurance agencies, or State guaranty agencies, for payment for services rendered by <!-- PDFPage:334 -->such concerns or agencies in assisting the Secretary in making such recovery. Any contract under this subsection entered into by the Secretary shall provide that attempts to make recovery on such loans shall be fair and reasonable, and do not involve harassment, intimidation, false or misleading representations, or unnecessary communications concerning the existence of any such loan to persons other than the student borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forbearance not precluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the student borrower which may be agreed upon by the parties to the insured loan and approved by the Secretary, or to preclude forbearance by the Secretary in the enforcement of the insured obligation after payment on that insurance. Any forbearance which is approved by the Secretary under this subsection with respect to the repayment of a loan, including a forbearance during default, shall not be considered as indicating that a holder of a federally insured loan has failed to exercise reasonable care and due diligence in the collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Care and diligence required of holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to excuse the holder of a federally insured loan from exercising reasonable care and diligence in the making and collection of loans under the provisions of this part. If the Secretary, after a reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to an eligible lender, finds that it has substantially failed to exercise such care and diligence or to make the reports and statements required under section 1078(a)(4) of this title and section 1079(a)(3) of this title, or to pay the required Federal loan insurance premiums, the Secretary shall disqualify that lender for further Federal insurance on loans granted pursuant to this part until the Secretary is satisfied that its failure has ceased and finds that there is reasonable assurance that the lender will in the future exercise necessary care and diligence or comply with such requirements, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Default rate of lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall annually publish a list indicating the cohort default rate (determined in accordance with section 1085(m) of this title) for each originating lender, subsequent holder, and guaranty agency participating in the program assisted under this part and an average cohort default rate for all institutions of higher education within each State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a cohort default rate through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control, or any similar device.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rate establishment and correction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a cohort default rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies (determined consistent with section 1085(m) of this title), except that the rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies shall not reflect any loans issued in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title. The Secretary shall allow institutions, lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies the opportunity to correct such cohort default rate information.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established a student loan insurance fund (hereinafter in this section called the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;) which shall be available without fiscal year limitation to the Secretary for making payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with payments under a guaranty agreement under section 1078(c) of this title. All amounts received by the Secretary as premium charges for insurance and as receipts, earnings, or proceeds derived from any claim or other assets acquired by the Secretary in connection with operations under this part, any excess advances under section 1072 of this title, and any other moneys, property, or assets derived by the Secretary from operations in connection with this section, shall be deposited in the fund. All payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with such guaranty agreements shall be paid from the fund. Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations under this section may be invested in bonds or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Borrowing authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If at any time the moneys in the fund are insufficient to make payments in connection with the default of any loan insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with any guaranty agreement made under section 1078(c) of this title, the Secretary is authorized, to the extent provided in advance by appropriations Acts, to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Required disclosure before disbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each eligible lender shall, at or prior to the time such lender disburses a loan which is insured or guaranteed under this part (other than a loan made under section 1078&ndash;3 of this title), provide thorough and accurate loan information on such loan to the borrower. Any disclosure required by this subsection may be made by an eligible lender as part of the written application material provided to the borrower, or as part of the promissory note evidencing the loan, or on a separate written form provided to the borrower. The disclosure shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a statement prominently and clearly displayed and in bold print that the borrower is receiving a loan that must be repaid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the name of the eligible lender, and the address to which communications and payments should be sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the principal amount of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the amount of any charges, such as the origination fee and insurance premium, collected by the lender at or prior to the disbursal of the loan and whether such charges are deducted from the proceeds of the loan or paid separately by the borrower;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the yearly and cumulative maximum amounts that may be borrowed;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:344 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) a statement of the total cumulative balance, including the loan applied for, owed by the student to that lender, and an estimate of the projected monthly payment, given such cumulative balance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) an explanation of any special options the borrower may have for loan consolidation or other refinancing of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) a statement that the borrower has the right to prepay all or part of the loan, at any time, without penalty, a statement summarizing circumstances in which repayment of the loan or interest that accrues on the loan may be deferred, and a brief notice of the program for repayment of loans, on the basis of military service, pursuant to section 902 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981 (10 U.S.C. 2141, note);&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1083_1_target" name="1083_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) a definition of default and the consequences to the borrower if the borrower defaults, including a statement that the default will be reported to a credit bureau or credit reporting agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) to the extent practicable, the effect of accepting the loan on the eligibility of the borrower for other forms of student assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) an explanation of any cost the borrower may incur in the making or collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required disclosure before repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each eligible lender shall, at or prior to the start of the repayment period of the student borrower on loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, disclose to the borrower the information required under this subsection. For any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, other than a loan made under section 1078&ndash;2 or 1078&ndash;3 of this title, such disclosure required by this subsection shall be made not less than 30 days nor more than 240 days before the first payment on the loan is due from the borrower. The disclosure shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the name of the eligible lender, and the address to which communications and payments should be sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the scheduled date upon which the repayment period is to begin;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the estimated balance owed by the borrower on the loan or loans covered by the disclosure as of the scheduled date on which the repayment period is to begin (including, if applicable, the estimated amount of interest to be capitalized);</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cost of disclosure and consequences of nondisclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such information shall be available without cost to the borrower. The failure of an eligible lender to provide information as required by this section shall not (1) relieve a borrower of the obligation to repay a loan in accordance with its terms, (2) provide a basis for a claim for civil damages, or (3) be deemed to abrogate the obligation of the Secretary under a contract of insurance or reinsurance, or the obligation of a guaranty agency under a contract of guaranty. Nothing in this section shall be construed as subjecting the lender to the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] with regard to loans made under this part. The Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the continued participation of an eligible lender in making loans under this part for failure by that lender to comply with this section.</p>

The requirement of this subsection shall be in addition to the information required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special disclosure rules on SLS loans and PLUS loans and unsubsidized loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans made under sections 1078&ndash;1,<sup><a href="#1083_2_target" name="1083_2">2</a></sup> 1078&ndash;2, and 1078&ndash;8 of this title shall not be subject to the disclosure of projected monthly payment amounts required under subsection (b)(8) of this section if the lender, in lieu of such disclosure, provides the borrower with sample projections of monthly repayment amounts assuming different levels of borrowing and interest accruals resulting from capitalization of interest while the borrower is in school. Such sample projections shall disclose the cost to the student of capitalizing&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1087&ndash;1. Special allowances</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of special allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) and paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans shall be computed (i) by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such 3-month period, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rate on such loans from such average, (iii) by adding 3.10 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations, the income from which is exempt from taxation under title 26 shall be one-half the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), except that, in determining the rate for the purpose of this division, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interests or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds. This subparagraph shall not apply to loans which were made or insured prior to October 1, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The quarterly rate of the special allowance set under division (i) of this subparagraph shall not be less than 9.5 percent minus the applicable interest rate on such loans, divided by 4.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) No special allowance may be paid under this subparagraph unless the issuer of such obligations complies with subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which are financed with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations originally issued on or after October 1, 1993, the income from which is excluded from gross income under title 26, shall be the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), (E), or (F), as the case may be. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interest or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) In the case of loans made before October 1, 1992, pursuant to section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> or 1078&ndash;2 of this title for which the interest rate is determined under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title, a special allowance shall not be paid unless the rate determined for any 12-month period under subparagraph (B) of such section exceeds 12 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) In the case of loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1992, pursuant to section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> or <!-- PDFPage:354 -->1078&ndash;2 of this title for which the interest rate is determined under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title, a special allowance shall not be paid unless the rate determined for any 12-month period under section 1077a(c)(4)(B) of this title exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) 11 percent in the case of a loan under section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) 10 percent in the case of a loan under section 1078&ndash;2 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) In the case of loans made or purchased directly from funds loaned or advanced pursuant to a qualified State obligation, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For the purpose of division (i) of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified State obligation&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) an obligation of the Maine Educational Loan Marketing Corporation to the Student Loan Marketing Association pursuant to an agreement entered into on January 31, 1984; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) an obligation of the South Carolina Student Loan Corporation to the South Carolina National Bank pursuant to an agreement entered into on July 30, 1986.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the case of any loan for which the applicable rate of interest is described in section 1077a(g)(2) of this title, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;2.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Subject to paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans for which the applicable rate of interest is determined under section 1077a(h) of this title shall be computed (i) by determining the applicable bond equivalent rate of the security with a comparable maturity, as established by the Secretary, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rates on such loans from such applicable bond equivalent rate, (iii) by adding 1.0 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(f) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contractual right of holders to special allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The holder of an eligible loan shall be deemed to have a contractual right against the United States, during the life of such loan, to receive the special allowance according to the provisions of this section. The special allowance determined for any such 3-month period shall be paid promptly after the close of such period, and without administrative delay after receipt of an accurate and complete request for payment, pursuant to procedures established by regulations promulgated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Penalty for late payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If payments of the special allowances payable under this section or of interest payments under section 1078(a) of this title with respect to a loan have not been made within 30 days after the Secretary has received an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment thereof, the special allowance payable to such holder shall be increased by an amount equal to the daily interest accruing on the special allowance and interest benefits payments due the holder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such daily interest shall be computed at the daily equivalent rate of the sum of the special allowance rate computed pursuant to paragraph (2) and the interest rate applicable to the loan and shall be paid for the later of (i) the 31st day after the receipt of such request for payment from the holder, or (ii) the 31st day after the final day of the period or periods covered by such request, and shall be paid for each succeeding day until, and including, the date on which the Secretary authorizes payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For purposes of reporting to the Congress the amounts of special allowances paid under this section, amounts of special allowances paid pursuant to this paragraph shall be segregated and reported separately.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &ldquo;Eligible loan&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;eligible loan&rdquo; means a loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) on which a portion of the interest is paid on behalf of the student and for the student's account to the holder of the loan under section 1078(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) which is made under section 1078&ndash;1,<sup><a href="#1087-1_2_target" name="1087-1_2">2</a></sup> 1078&ndash;2, 1078&ndash;3, 1078&ndash;8, or 1087&ndash;2(<em>o</em>) of this title; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Use of average quarterly balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall permit lenders to calculate interest benefits and special allowance through the use of the average quarterly balance method until July 1, 1988.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Origination fees from students</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deduction from interest and special allowance subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the total amount of interest and special allowance payable under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, respectively, to any holder shall be reduced by <!-- PDFPage:355 -->the Secretary by the amount which the lender is authorized to charge as an origination fee in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection. If the total amount of interest and special allowance payable under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, respectively, is less than the amount the lender was authorized to charge borrowers for origination fees in that quarter, the Secretary shall deduct the excess amount from the subsequent quarters&rsquo; payments until the total amount has been deducted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of origination fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (6) of this subsection, with respect to any loan (other than loans made under sections 1078&ndash;3 and 1087&ndash;2(<em>o</em>) of this title) for which a completed note or other written evidence of the loan was sent or delivered to the borrower for signing on or after 10 days after August 13, 1981, each eligible lender under this part is authorized to charge the borrower an origination fee in an amount not to exceed 3.0 percent of the principal amount of the loan, to be deducted proportionately from each installment payment of the proceeds of the loan prior to payment to the borrower.</p>
