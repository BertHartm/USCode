<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program authority and method of distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For each fiscal year through fiscal year 2004, the Secretary shall pay to each eligible institution such sums as may be necessary to pay to each eligible student (defined in accordance with section 1091 of this title) for each academic year during which that student is in attendance at an institution of higher education, as an undergraduate, a Federal Pell Grant in the amount for which that student is eligible, as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Not less than 85 percent of such sums shall be advanced to eligible institutions prior to the start of each payment period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the institution as needed to pay eligible students until such time as the Secretary determines and publishes in the Federal Register with an opportunity for comment, an alternative payment system that provides payments to institutions in an accurate and timely manner,,<sup><a href="#1070a_1_target" name="1070a_1">1</a></sup> except that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to place an institution on a reimbursement system of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to students, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an amount for which they are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Grants made under this subpart shall be known as &ldquo;Federal Pell Grants&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose and amount of grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of this subpart is to provide a Federal Pell Grant that in combination with reasonable family and student contribution and supplemented by the programs authorized under subparts 3 and 4 of this part, will meet at least 75 percent of a student's cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title), unless the institution determines that a greater amount of <!-- PDFPage:255 -->assistance would better serve the purposes of section 1070&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1070a_2_target" name="1070a_2">2</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the Federal Pell Grant for a student eligible under this part shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $4,500 for academic year 1999&ndash;2000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $4,800 for academic year 2000&ndash;2001;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) $5,100 for academic year 2001&ndash;2002;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) $5,400 for academic year 2002&ndash;2003; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) $5,800 for academic year 2003&ndash;2004,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the expected family contribution with respect to that student for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where a student attends an institution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (including a student who attends an institution of higher education on less than a half-time basis) during any academic year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant to which that student is entitled shall be reduced in proportion to the degree to which that student is not so attending on a full-time basis, in accordance with a schedule of reductions established by the Secretary for the purposes of this division, computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For any academic year for which an appropriation Act provides a maximum basic grant in an amount in excess of $2,700, the amount of a student's basic grant shall equal $2,700 plus&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) one-half of the amount by which such maximum basic grant exceeds $2,700; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the remaining one-half of such excess; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the sum of the student's tuition and, if the student has dependent care expenses (as described in section 1087<em>ll</em>(8) of this title) or disability-related expenses (as described in section 1087<em>ll</em>(9) of this title), an allowance determined by the institution for such expenses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An institution that charged only fees in lieu of tuition as of October 1, 1998, may include in the institution's determination of tuition charged, fees that would normally constitute tuition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No Federal Pell Grant under this subpart shall exceed the difference between the expected family contribution for a student and the cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title) at the institution at which that student is in attendance. If, with respect to any student, it is determined that the amount of a Federal Pell Grant plus the amount of the expected family contribution for that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant shall be reduced until the combination of expected family contribution and the amount of the Federal Pell Grant does not exceed the cost of attendance at such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No Federal Pell Grant shall be awarded to a student under this subpart if the amount of that grant for that student as determined under this subsection for any academic year is less than $400, except that a student who is eligible for a Federal Pell Grant that is equal to or greater than $200 but less than $400 shall be awarded a Federal Pell Grant of $400.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive 2 Pell grants during a single award year, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the student is enrolled full-time in an associate or baccalaureate degree program of study that is 2 years or longer at an eligible institution that is computed in credit hours; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the student completes course work toward completion of an associate or baccalaureate degree that exceeds the requirements for a full academic year as defined by the institution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall promulgate regulations implementing this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the Secretary shall allow the amount of the Federal Pell Grant to be exceeded for students participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the institution at which the student is enrolled when the reasonable costs of such program are greater than the cost of attendance at the student's home institution, except that the amount of such Federal Pell Grant in any fiscal year shall not exceed the grant level specified in the appropriate Appropriation Act for this subpart for such year. If the preceding sentence applies, the financial aid administrator at the home institution may use the cost of the study abroad program, rather than the home institution's cost, to determine the cost of attendance of the student.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) No Federal Pell Grant shall be awarded under this subpart to any individual who is incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period of eligibility for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The period during which a student may receive Federal Pell Grants shall be the period required for the completion of the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study being pursued by that student at the institution at which the student is in attendance except that any period during which the student is enrolled in a noncredit or remedial course of study as defined in paragraph (2) shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility courses of study which are noncredit or remedial in nature (including courses in English language instruction) which are determined by the institution to be necessary to help the student be prepared for the pursuit of a first undergraduate baccalaureate degree or certificate or, in the case of courses in English language instruction, to be necessary to enable the student to utilize already existing knowledge, training, or skills. Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the student is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No student is entitled to receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one institution or from the Secretary and an institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive a Federal Pell Grant if the student&mdash;</p>

The application shall contain such information as may be required by, or pursuant to, regulation for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to make the determinations required under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of Federal share of grants made by qualified program</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provides that, effective with respect to any academic year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, all nonprofit institutions of higher education in the State are eligible to participate in the State program, except in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of the constitution of the State or in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of a statute of the State which was enacted prior to October 1, 1978;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provides for the payment of the non-Federal portion of such grants or of such work-study jobs from funds supplied by such State which represent an additional expenditure for such year by such State for grants or work-study jobs for students attending institutions of higher education over the amount expended by such State for such grants or work-study jobs, if any, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such State initially received funds under this subpart;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provides that if the State's allocation under this subpart is based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students who are independent students or attending the institution less than full time, a reasonable proportion of the State's allocation shall be made available to such students;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon his approval of any application for a payment under this subpart, the Secretary shall reserve from the applicable allotment (including any applicable reallotment) available therefor, the amount of such payment, which (subject to the limits of such allotment or reallotment) shall be equal to the Federal share of the cost of <!-- PDFPage:282 -->the students&rsquo; incentive grants or work-study jobs covered by such application. The Secretary shall pay such reserved amount, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may amend the reservation of any amount under this section, either upon approval of an amendment of the application or upon revision of the estimated cost of the student grants or work-study jobs with respect to which such reservation was made. If the Secretary approves an upward revision of such estimated cost, the Secretary may reserve the Federal share of the added cost only from the applicable allotment (or reallotment) available at the time of such approval.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The nature of postsecondary education delivery is changing, and new technology and other related innovations can provide promising education opportunities for individuals who are currently not being served, particularly for individuals without easy access to traditional campus-based postsecondary education or for whom traditional courses are a poor match with education or training needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Individuals, including individuals seeking basic or technical skills or their first postsecondary experience, individuals with disabilities, dislocated workers, individuals making the transition from welfare-to-work, and individuals who are limited by time and place constraints can benefit from nontraditional, noncampus-based postsecondary education opportunities and appropriate support services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The need for high-quality, nontraditional, technology-based education opportunities is great, as is the need for skill competency credentials and other measures of educational progress and attainment that are valid and widely accepted, but neither need is likely to be adequately addressed by the uncoordinated efforts of agencies and institutions acting independently and without assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Partnerships, consisting of institutions of higher education, community organizations, or other public or private agencies or organizations, can coordinate and combine institutional resources&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide the needed variety of education options to students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to develop new means of ensuring accountability and quality for innovative education methods.</p>

If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title, and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title in order to enable students in the State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such an agreement. The Secretary may make advances under this subsection both to a State program (with which he has such an agreement) and to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations (with which he has such an agreement) in that State if he determines that such advances are necessary in order that students in each eligible institution have access through <!-- PDFPage:296 -->such institution to a student loan insurance program which meets the requirements of section 1078(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Matching requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No advance shall be made after June 30, 1968, unless matched by an equal amount from non-Federal sources. Such equal amount may include the unencumbered non-Federal portion of a reserve fund. As used in the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;unencumbered non-Federal portion&rdquo; means the amount (determined as of the time immediately preceding the making of the advance) of the reserve fund less the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Advances pursuant to this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions (including conditions relating to the time or times of payment) consistent with the requirements of section 1078(b) of this title as the Secretary determines will best carry out the purpose of this section. Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate in each case in the light of the maturity and solvency of the reserve fund for which the advance was made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds recalled by the Secretary under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Required share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall require each guaranty agency to return reserve funds under para<!-- PDFPage:301 -->graph (1) on the basis of the agency's required share. For purposes of this paragraph, a guaranty agency's required share shall be determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Equal percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall require each guaranty agency to return an amount representing an equal percentage reduction in the amount of reserve funds held by the agency on September 30, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Calculation</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), the percentage reduction under subparagraph (B) shall not result in the depletion of the reserve funds of any agency which charges the 1.0 percent insurance premium pursuant to section 1078(b)(1)(H) of this title below an amount equal to the amount of lender claim payments paid during the 90 days prior to the date of the return under this subsection. If any additional amount is required to be returned after deducting the total of the required shares under subparagraph (B) and as a result of the preceding sentence, such additional amount shall be obtained by imposing on each guaranty agency to which the preceding sentence does not apply, an equal percentage reduction in the amount of the agency's remaining reserve funds.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Offset of required shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any guaranty agency returns to the Secretary any reserve funds in excess of the amount required under this subsection or subsection (h) of this section, the total amount required to be returned under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the amount of such excess reserve funds returned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition of reserve funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;reserve funds&rdquo; when used with respect to a guaranty agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) includes any reserve funds in cash or liquid assets held by the guaranty agency, or held by, or under the control of, any other entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not include buildings, equipment, or other nonliquid assets.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each guaranty agency shall, not later than 60 days after October 7, 1998, deposit all funds, securities, and other liquid assets contained in the reserve fund established pursuant to section 1072 of this title into a Federal Student Loan Reserve Fund (in this section and section 1072b of this title referred to as the &ldquo;Federal Fund&rdquo;), which shall be an account of a type selected by the agency, with the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investment of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds transferred to the Federal Fund shall be invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or a State, or in other similarly low-risk securities selected by the guaranty agency, with the approval of the Secretary. Earnings from the Federal Fund shall be the sole property of the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the establishment of the Federal Fund, a guaranty agency shall deposit into the Federal Fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) all amounts received from the Secretary as payment of reinsurance on loans pursuant to section 1078(c)(1) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) from amounts collected on behalf of the obligation of a defaulted borrower, a percentage amount equal to the complement of the reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the guaranty agreement was made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with respect to the defaulted loan pursuant to sections 1078(c)(6)(A) and 1078&ndash;6(a)(1)(B) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to a loan that the Secretary has repaid or discharged under section 1087 of this title;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) insurance premiums collected from borrowers pursuant to sections 1078(b)(1)(H) and 1078&ndash;8(h) of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) other receipts as specified in regulations of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Uses of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (f) of this section, the Federal Fund may only be used by a guaranty agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay lender claims pursuant to sections 1078(b)(1)(G), 1078(j), 1087, and 1087&ndash;2(q) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay into the Agency Operating Fund established pursuant to section 1072b of this title (in this section and section 1072b of this title referred to as the &ldquo;Operating Fund&rdquo;) a default aversion fee in accordance with section 1078(<em>l</em>) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Ownership of Federal Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Fund, and any nonliquid asset (such as a building or equipment) developed or purchased by the guaranty agency in whole or in part with Federal reserve funds, regardless of who holds or controls the Federal reserve funds or such asset, shall be considered to be the property of the United States, prorated based on the percentage of such asset developed or purchased with Federal reserve funds, which property shall be used in the operation of the program authorized by this part, as provided in subsection (d) of this section. The Secretary may restrict or regulate the use of such asset only to the extent necessary to reasonably protect the Secretary's prorated share of the value of such asset. The Secretary may direct a guaranty agency, or such agency's officers or directors, to cease any activity involving expenditures, use, or transfer of the Federal Fund administered by the guaranty agency that the Secretary determines is a misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure of the Federal Fund or the Secretary's share of such asset.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to establish the Operating Fund, each guaranty agency may transfer not more than 180 days&rsquo; cash expenses for normal operating expenses (not including claim payments) as a working capital reserve as defined in Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;87 (Cost Accounting Standards) from the Federal Fund for deposit into the Operating Fund for use in the performance of the guaranty agency's duties under this part. Such transfers may occur during the first 3 years following the establishment of the Operating Fund. However, no agency may transfer in excess of 45 percent of the balance, as of September 30, 1998, of the agency's Federal Fund to the agency's Operating Fund during such 3-year period. In determining the amount that may be transferred, the agency shall ensure that sufficient funds remain in the Federal Fund to pay lender claims within the required time periods and to meet the reserve recall requirements of this section and subsections (h) and (i) of section 1072 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A limited number of guaranty agencies may transfer interest earned on the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund during the first 3 years after October 7, 1998, if the guaranty agency demonstrates to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cash flow in the Operating Fund will be negative without the transfer of such interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transfer of such interest will substantially improve the financial circumstances of the guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Repayment provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall begin repayment of sums transferred pursuant to this subsection not later than the start of the fourth year after the establishment of the Operating Fund, and shall repay all amounts transferred not later than 5 years from the date of the establishment of the Operating Fund. With respect to amounts transferred from the Federal Fund, the guaranty agency shall not be required to repay any interest on the funds <!-- PDFPage:303 -->transferred and subsequently repaid. The guaranty agency shall provide to the Secretary a reasonable schedule for repayment of the sums transferred and an annual financial analysis demonstrating the agency's ability to comply with the schedule and repay all outstanding sums transferred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a guaranty agency transfers funds from the Federal Fund in accordance with this section, and fails to make scheduled repayments to the Federal Fund, the agency may not receive any other funds under this part until the Secretary determines that the agency has made such repayments. The Secretary shall pay to the guaranty agency any funds withheld in accordance with this paragraph immediately upon making the determination that the guaranty agency has made all such repayments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) waive the requirements of paragraph (3), but only with respect to repayment of interest that was transferred in accordance with paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) waive paragraph (4);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">for a guaranty agency, if the Secretary determines that there are extenuating circumstances (such as State constitutional prohibitions) beyond the control of the agency that justify such a waiver.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Extension of repayment period for interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Extension permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall extend the period for repayment of interest that was transferred in accordance with paragraph (2) from 2 years to 5 years if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the cash flow of the Operating Fund will be negative as a result of repayment as required by paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the repayment of the interest transferred will substantially diminish the financial circumstances of the guaranty agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the guaranty agency has demonstrated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) that the agency is able to repay all transferred funds by the end of the 8th year following the date of establishment of the Operating Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that the agency will be financially sound on the completion of repayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repayment of income on transferred funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All repayments made to the Federal Fund during the 6th, 7th, and 8th years following the establishment of the Operating Fund of interest that was transferred shall include the sums transferred plus any income earned from the investment of the sums transferred after the 5th year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Investment of Federal funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds transferred from the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund for operating expenses shall be invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or a State, or in other similarly low-risk securities selected by the guaranty agency, with the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In calculating the minimum reserve level required by section 1078(c)(9)(A) of this title, the Secretary shall include all amounts owed to the Federal Fund by the guaranty agency in the calculation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Repayment of principal on loans made under this section shall commence not later than 60 <!-- PDFPage:343 -->days after the date such loan is disbursed by the lender, subject to deferral during any period during which the parent meets the conditions required for a deferral under section 1077(a)(2)(C) or 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title.</p>

Unless the consolidated loan is obtained by a borrower who is electing to obtain variable interest under paragraph (2) or (3), such consolidated loan shall bear interest at the weighted average of the rates of all included loans. The extension of any repayment period of an included loan pursuant to this paragraph shall be reported (if required by them) to the Secretary or guaranty agency insuring the loan, as the case may be, but no additional insurance premiums shall be payable with respect to any such extension. The extension of the repayment period of any included loan shall not require the formal extension of the promissory note evidencing the included loan or the execution of a new promissory note, but shall be treated as an administrative forbearance of the repayment terms of the included loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Refinancing to secure variable interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An eligible lender may reissue a loan which was made under this section before July 1, 1987, or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, in order to permit the borrower to obtain the interest rate provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title. A lender offering to reissue a loan or loans for such purpose may charge a borrower an amount not to exceed $100 to cover the administrative costs of reissuing such loan or loans, not more than one-half of which shall be paid to the guarantor of the loan being reissued to cover costs of reissuance. Reissuance of a loan under this paragraph shall not affect any insurance applicable with respect to the loan, and no additional insurance fee may be charged to the borrower with respect to the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refinancing by discharge of previous loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A borrower who has applied to an original lender for reissuance of a loan under paragraph (2) and who is denied such reissuance may obtain a loan from another lender for the purpose of discharging the loan from such original lender.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall bear interest at the applicable rate of interest provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall not result in the extension of the duration of the note (other than as permitted under subsection (c)(5)(B) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may be subject to an additional insurance fee but shall not be subject to the administrative cost charge permitted by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall be applied to discharge the borrower from any remaining obligation to the original lender with respect to the original loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certification in lieu of promissory note presentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each new lender may accept certification from the original lender of the borrower's original loan in lieu of presentation of the original promissory note.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notification to borrowers of availability of refinancing options</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each holder of a loan made under this section or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, shall, not later than October 1, 1987, in the case of loans made before October 17, 1986, notify the borrower of such loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) of the refinancing options for which the borrower is eligible under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) of those options which will be made available by the holder and of the practical consequences of such options in terms of interest rates and monthly and total payments for a set of loan examples; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that, with respect to any option that the holder will not make available, the hold<!-- PDFPage:344 -->er will, to the extent practicable, refer the borrower to an eligible lender offering such option.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A parent who wishes to borrow funds under this section shall be subject to verification of the parent's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) immigration status in the same manner as immigration status is verified for students under section 1091(g) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) social security number in the same manner as social security numbers are verified for students under section 1091(p) of this title.</p>

Such loan shall not be sold to an eligible lender who has been found by the guaranty agency or the Secretary to have substantially failed to exercise the due diligence required of lenders under this part. Neither the guaranty agency nor the Secretary shall demand from a borrower as monthly payment amounts referred to in this paragraph more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An agreement between the guaranty agency and the Secretary for purposes of this paragraph shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the repayment by the agency to the Secretary of 81.5 percent of the amount of the principal balance outstanding at the time of such sale, multiplied by the reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the guaranty agreement was made with respect to the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for the reinstatement by the Secretary (I) of the obligation to reimburse such agency for the amount expended by it in discharge of its insurance obligation under its loan insurance program, and (II) of the obligation to pay to the holder of such loan a special allowance pursuant to section 1087&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A loan which does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) may also be eligible for sale under this paragraph upon a determination that the loan was in default due to clerical or data processing error and would not, in the absence of such error, be in a delinquent status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of proceeds of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts received by the Secretary pursuant to the sale of such loans by a guaranty agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be deducted from the calculations of the amount of reimbursement for which the agency is eligible under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection for the fiscal year in which the amount was received, notwithstanding the fact that the default occurred in a prior fiscal year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:353 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Borrower eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any borrower whose loan is sold under paragraph (1) shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional loans or grants under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (for which he or she is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such loan sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability of general loan conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan which is sold under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, so long as the borrower continues to make scheduled repayments thereon, be subject to the same terms and conditions and qualify for the same benefits and privileges as other loans made under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Satisfactory repayment arrangements to renew eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each guaranty agency shall establish a program which allows a borrower with a defaulted loan or loans to renew eligibility for all title IV student financial assistance (regardless of whether the defaulted loan has been sold to an eligible lender) upon the borrower's payment of 6 consecutive monthly payments. The guaranty agency shall not demand from a borrower as a monthly payment amount under this subsection more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. A borrower may only obtain the benefit of this subsection with respect to renewed eligibility once.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible borrowers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any student meeting the requirements for student eligibility under section 1091 of this title (including graduate and professional students as defined in regulations promulgated by the Secretary) shall be entitled to borrow an unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan if the eligible institution at which the student has been accepted for enrollment, or at which the student is in attendance, has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) determined and documented the student's need for the loan based on the student's estimated cost of attendance (as determined under section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title) and the student's estimated financial assistance, including a loan which qualifies for interest subsidy payments under section 1078 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provided the lender a statement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certifying the eligibility of the student to receive a loan under this section and the amount of the loan for which such student is eligible, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) setting forth a schedule for disbursement of the proceeds of the loan in installments, consistent with the requirements of section 1078&ndash;7 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of amount of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) of this section shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loan limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the annual and aggregate limits for loans under this section shall be the same as those established under section 1078(b)(1) of this title, less any amount received by such student pursuant to the subsidized loan program established under section 1078 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual limits for independent, graduate, and professional students</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such student is enrolled in a program of undergraduate education which is less than one academic year, the maximum annual loan amount that such student may receive may not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount specified in clause (i) as the length of such program measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours bears to one academic year;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a student at an eligible institution who has successfully completed such first and second years but has not successfully completed the remainder of a program of undergraduate education&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) $5,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such student is enrolled in a program of undergraduate education, the remainder of which is less than one academic year, the maximum annual loan amount that such student may receive may not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount specified in subclause (I) as such remainder measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours bears to one academic year;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except in cases where the Secretary determines,<sup><a href="#1078-8_1_target" name="1078-8_1">1</a></sup> that a higher amount is warranted in order to carry out the purpose of this part with respect to students engaged in specialized training requiring exceptionally high costs of education, but the annual insurable limit per student shall not be deemed to be exceeded by a line of credit under which actual payments by the lender to the borrower will not be made in any years in excess of the annual limit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Aggregate limits for independent, graduate, and professional students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The maximum aggregate amount of loans under this section a student described in paragraph (2) may borrow shall be the amount described in paragraph (1), adjusted to reflect the increased annual limits described in paragraph (2), as prescribed by the Secretary by regulation.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Capitalization of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Interest on loans made under this section for which payments of principal are not required during the in-school and grace periods or for which payments are deferred under sections 1077(a)(2)(C) and 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title shall, if agreed upon by the borrower and the lender&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be paid monthly or quarterly; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) when the borrower defaults.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the periodic payment and the repayment schedule for any loan made pursuant to this section shall be established by assuming an interest rate equal to the applicable rate of interest at the time the repayment of the principal amount of the loan commences. At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Repayment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of calculating the repayment period under section 1078(b)(9) of this title, <!-- PDFPage:357 -->such period shall commence at the time the first payment of principal is due from the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Qualification for forbearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A lender may grant the borrower of a loan under this section a forbearance for a period not to exceed 60 days if the lender reasonably determines that such a forbearance from collection activity is warranted following a borrower's request for forbearance, deferment, or a change in repayment plan, or a request to consolidate loans in order to collect or process appropriate supporting documentation related to the request. During any such period, interest on the loan shall accrue but not be capitalized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Repealed. Pub. L. 105&ndash;244, title IV, &sect;423(f), Oct. 7, 1998, 112 Stat. 1698</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary determines that an eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency has a compliance performance rating that equals or exceeds 97 percent, the Secretary shall designate the eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency, as the case may be, for exceptional performance. The Secretary shall notify each appropriate guaranty agency of the eligible lenders and servicers designated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance performance rating</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a compliance performance rating is determined with respect to compliance with due diligence in the collection of loans under this part for each year for which the determination is made. Such rating is equal to the percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary by regulation, with respect to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay each eligible lender or servicer (as agent for an eligible lender) designated under subsection (a) of this section 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest of all loans for which claims are submitted for payment by that eligible lender or servicer for the one-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under this section or until the guaranty agency receives notice from the Secretary that the designation of the lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section has been revoked.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall revoke the designation of a lender or servicer under subsection (a) of <!-- PDFPage:359 -->this section if any quarterly audit required under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not received by the Secretary by the date established by the Secretary or if the audit indicates the lender or servicer failed to maintain 97 percent or higher compliance with program regulations, as reflected in the performance of not less than 97 percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary for the purpose of this section, for 2 consecutive months or 90 percent for 1 month.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit the authority of guaranty agencies to require the submission of claims documentation evidencing servicing performed on loans, except that the guaranty agency may not require greater documentation than that required for lenders and servicers not designated under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payments to guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall pay to each guaranty agency designated under subsection (a) of this section the appropriate percentage under this subsection for the 1-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

The standards shall measure the lender's or servicer's compliance with the due diligence standards and shall include a defined statistical sampling technique designed to measure the performance rating of the eligible lender or servicer for the purpose of this section. Each eligible lender or servicer shall submit the audit required by this section to the Secretary and to each appropriate guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional information on lenders and servicers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each appropriate guaranty agency shall provide the Secretary with such other information in its possession regarding an eligible lender or servicer desiring designation as may relate to the Secretary's determination under subsection (a) of this section, including but not limited to any information suggesting that the application of a lender or servicer for designation under subsection (a) of this section should not be approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section, such other information as provided by any guaranty agency under paragraph (2), and any information in the possession of the Secretary or submitted by any other agency or office of the Federal Government. If the results of the audit are not persuasively rebutted by such other information, the Secretary shall inform the eligible lender or servicer and the appropriate guaranty agency that its application for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer has been approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cost of audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible lender or servicer shall pay for all the costs of the audits required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Compliance audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to maintain its status as an exceptional eligible lender or servicer, the lender or servicer shall undergo a quarterly compliance audit at the end of each quarter (other than the quarter in which status as an exceptional lender or servicer is established through a financial and compliance audit, as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section), and submit the results of such audit to the Secretary and such appropriate guaranty agency. The compliance audit will review compliance with due diligence requirements for the period since the last audit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Loss of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the audit performed pursuant to paragraph (5) fails to meet the standards for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the lender or servicer shall lose its designation as an exceptional lender or servicer. A lender or servicer receiving a compliance audit not meeting the standard for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer may reapply for designation under subsection (a) of this section at any time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Due diligence standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Due diligence standards used for determining compliance under paragraph (5) shall be promulgated by the Secretary after consultation with lenders, guaranty agencies and servicers and shall consist of a list of specific elements for the Federal regulations selected to provide an indication of systems degradation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Additional revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, designation under subsection (a) of this section may be revoked at any time by the Secretary if the Secretary determines that the eligible lender or servicer has failed to maintain an overall level of regulatory compliance consistent with the audit submitted by the eligible lender or servicer under this section or if the Secretary believes the lender or servicer may have engaged in fraud in securing designation under subsection (a) of this section or is failing to service loans in accordance with program regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of designated guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Audit of guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency desiring a designation under subsection (a) of this section shall have <!-- PDFPage:360 -->a financial and compliance audit of the defaulted loan portfolio of such guaranty agency conducted annually by a qualified independent organization or person from a list of qualified organizations or persons promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General and the Secretary. The standards shall include defined statistical sampling techniques designed to measure the performance rating of the guaranty agency for the purpose of this section. Each guaranty agency shall submit the audit required by this paragraph to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quarterly sample audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may require quarterly sample audits as a means of determining continued qualification of the guaranty agency for designation as an exceptional guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section and other information in his possession.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation for fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may revoke the designation of a guaranty agency under subsection (a) of this section at any time if the Secretary has reason to believe the guaranty agency secured its designation under subsection (a) of this section through fraud or fails to comply with applicable regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Revocation based on performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Designation as an exceptional guaranty agency may be revoked at any time by the Secretary upon 30 days notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary upon a finding by the Secretary that the guaranty agency has failed to maintain an acceptable overall level of regulatory compliance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursements made by the Secretary on loans submitted for claim by an eligible lender or loan servicer designated for exceptional performance under this section shall not be subject to additional review by the Secretary or repurchase by the guaranty agency for any reason other than a determination by the Secretary that the eligible lender, loan servicer, or guaranty agency engaged in fraud or other purposeful misconduct in obtaining designation for exceptional performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the processing of claims on student loans of eligible lenders not subject to this paragraph.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loan-by-loan insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to issue certificates on application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, upon application by an eligible lender, made upon such form, containing such information, and supported by such evidence as the Secretary may require, and otherwise in conformity with this section, the Secretary finds that the applicant has made a loan to an eligible student which is insurable under the provisions of this part, he may issue to the applicant a certificate of insurance covering the loan and setting forth the amount and terms of the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effectiveness of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall become effective upon the date of issuance of the certificate, except that the Secretary is authorized, in accordance with regulations, to issue commitments with respect to proposed loans, or with respect to lines (or proposed lines) of credit, submitted by eligible lenders, and in that event, upon compliance with subsection (a)(1) of this section by the lender, the certificate of insurance may be issued effective as of the date when any loan, or any payment by the lender pursuant to a line of credit, to be covered by such insurance was made. Such insurance shall cease to be effective upon 60 days&rsquo; default by the lender in the payment of any installment of the premiums payable pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contents of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An application submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall contain (A) an agreement by the applicant to pay, in ac<!-- PDFPage:365 -->cordance with regulations, the premiums fixed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and (B) an agreement by the applicant that if the loan is covered by insurance the applicant will submit such supplementary reports and statement during the effective period of the loan agreement, upon such forms, at such times, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe by or pursuant to regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Comprehensive insurance coverage certificate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of system by regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of requiring a separate insurance application and issuing a separate certificate of insurance for each student loan made by an eligible lender as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations consistent with section 1074 of this title, issue to any eligible lender applying therefor a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage which shall, without further action by the Secretary, insure all insurable loans made by that lender, on or after the date of the certificate and before a specified cutoff date, within the limits of an aggregate maximum amount stated in the certificate. Such regulations may provide for conditioning such insurance, with respect to any loan, upon compliance by the lender with such requirements (to be stated or incorporated by reference in the certificate) as in the Secretary's judgment will best achieve the purpose of this subsection while protecting the United States from the risk of unreasonable loss and promoting the objectives of this part, including (but not limited to) provisions as to the reporting of such loans and information relevant thereto to the Secretary and as to the payment of initial and other premiums and the effect of default therein, and including provision for confirmation by the Secretary from time to time (through endorsement of the certificate) of the coverage of specific new loans by such certificate, which confirmation shall be incontestable by the Secretary in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation of fact or patent error.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uncovered loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the holder of a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage issued under this subsection grants to a student a line of credit extending beyond the cutoff date specified in that certificate, loans or payments thereon made by the holder after that date pursuant to the line of credit shall not be deemed to be included in the coverage of that certificate except as may be specifically provided therein; but, subject to the limitations of section 1074 of this title, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations, make commitments to insure such future loans or payments, and such commitments may be honored either as provided in subsection (a) of this section or by inclusion of such insurance on comprehensive coverage under the subsection for the period or periods in which such future loans or payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Charges for Federal insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, pursuant to regulations, charge for insurance on each loan under this part a premium in an amount not to exceed one-fourth of 1 percent per year of the unpaid principal amount of such loan (excluding interest added to principal), payable in advance, at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations may provide that such premium shall not be payable, or if paid shall be refundable, with respect to any period after default in the payment of principal or interest or after the borrower has died or becomes totally and permanently disabled, if (1) notice of such default or other event has been duly given, and (2) requests for payment of the loss insured against has been made or the Secretary has made such payment on his own motion pursuant to section 1080(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignability of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rights of an eligible lender arising under insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance issued to it under this section may be assigned as security by such lender only to another eligible lender, and subject to regulation by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consolidation not to affect insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The consolidation of the obligations of two or more federally insured loans obtained by a student borrower in any fiscal year into a single obligation evidenced by a single instrument of indebtedness shall not affect the insurance by the United States. If the loans thus consolidated are covered by separate certificates of insurance issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may upon surrender of the original certificates issue a new certificate of insurance in accordance with that subsection upon the consolidated obligation; if they are covered by a single comprehensive certificate issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may amend that certificate accordingly.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1080. Default of student under Federal loan insurance program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to Secretary and payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon default by the student borrower on any loan covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant to this part, and prior to the commencement of suit or other enforcement proceedings upon security for that loan, the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the Secretary, and the Secretary shall if requested (at that time or after further collection efforts) by the beneficiary, or may on the Secretary's own motion, if the insurance is still in effect, pay to the beneficiary the amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan as soon as that amount has been determined. The &ldquo;amount of the loss&rdquo; on any loan shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be <!-- PDFPage:366 -->deemed to be an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the principal amount and accrued interest, including interest accruing from the date of submission of a valid default claim (as determined by the Secretary) to the date on which payment is authorized by the Secretary, reduced to the extent required by section 1075(b) of this title. Such beneficiary shall be required to meet the standards of due diligence in the collection of the loan and shall be required to submit proof that the institution was contacted and other reasonable attempts were made to locate the borrower (when the location of the borrower is unknown) and proof that contact was made with the borrower (when the location is known). The Secretary shall make the determination required to carry out the provisions of this section not later than 90 days after the notification by the insurance beneficiary and shall make payment in full on the amount of the beneficiary's loss pending completion of the due diligence investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon payment of the amount of the loss pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated for all of the rights of the holder of the obligation upon the insured loan and shall be entitled to an assignment of the note or other evidence of the insured loan by the insurance beneficiary. If the net recovery made by the Secretary on a loan after deduction of the cost of that recovery (including reasonable administrative costs and collection costs, to the extent set forth in regulations issued by the Secretary) exceeds the amount of the loss, the excess shall be paid over to the insured. The Secretary may, in attempting to make recovery on such loans, contract with private business concerns, State student loan insurance agencies, or State guaranty agencies, for payment for services rendered by such concerns or agencies in assisting the Secretary in making such recovery. Any contract under this subsection entered into by the Secretary shall provide that attempts to make recovery on such loans shall be fair and reasonable, and do not involve harassment, intimidation, false or misleading representations, or unnecessary communications concerning the existence of any such loan to persons other than the student borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forbearance not precluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the student borrower which may be agreed upon by the parties to the insured loan and approved by the Secretary, or to preclude forbearance by the Secretary in the enforcement of the insured obligation after payment on that insurance. Any forbearance which is approved by the Secretary under this subsection with respect to the repayment of a loan, including a forbearance during default, shall not be considered as indicating that a holder of a federally insured loan has failed to exercise reasonable care and due diligence in the collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Care and diligence required of holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to excuse the holder of a federally insured loan from exercising reasonable care and diligence in the making and collection of loans under the provisions of this part. If the Secretary, after a reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to an eligible lender, finds that it has substantially failed to exercise such care and diligence or to make the reports and statements required under section 1078(a)(4) of this title and section 1079(a)(3) of this title, or to pay the required Federal loan insurance premiums, the Secretary shall disqualify that lender for further Federal insurance on loans granted pursuant to this part until the Secretary is satisfied that its failure has ceased and finds that there is reasonable assurance that the lender will in the future exercise necessary care and diligence or comply with such requirements, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Default rate of lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall annually publish a list indicating the cohort default rate (determined in accordance with section 1085(m) of this title) for each originating lender, subsequent holder, and guaranty agency participating in the program assisted under this part and an average cohort default rate for all institutions of higher education within each State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a cohort default rate through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control, or any similar device.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rate establishment and correction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a cohort default rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies (determined consistent with section 1085(m) of this title), except that the rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies shall not reflect any loans issued in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title. The Secretary shall allow institutions, lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies the opportunity to correct such cohort default rate information.</p>

For the purpose of assisting such organizations in complying with the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], such agreements may provide for timely response by the Secretary (concerning loans covered by Federal loan insurance), by a guaranty agency, eligible lender, or subsequent holder (concerning loans covered by a guaranty agreement), or to requests from such organizations for responses to objections raised by borrowers. Subject to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, such agreements shall require the Secretary, the guaranty agency, eligible lender, or subsequent holder, as appropriate, to disclose to such organizations, with respect to any loan under this part that has not been repaid by the borrower&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established a student loan insurance fund (hereinafter in this section called the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;) which shall be available without fiscal year limitation to the Secretary for making payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with payments under a guaranty agreement under section 1078(c) of this title. All amounts received by the Secretary as premium charges for insurance and as receipts, earnings, or proceeds derived from any claim or other assets acquired by the Secretary in connection with operations under this part, any excess advances under section 1072 of this title, and any other moneys, property, or assets derived by the Secretary from operations in connection with this section, shall be deposited in the fund. All payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with such guaranty agreements shall be paid from the fund. Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations under this section may be invested in bonds or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States.</p>

Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes and other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter, are extended to include any purchase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired under this subsection.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary shall not lift any such sanction until the Secretary is satisfied that the lender has corrected the failures which led to the limitation, suspension, or termination, and finds that there are reasonable assurances that the lender will, in the future, comply with the requirements of this part.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary shall not lift any such sanction until the Secretary is satisfied that the institution has corrected the failures which led to the limitation, suspension, or termination, and finds that there are reasonable assurances that the institution will, in the future, comply with the requirements of this part.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Federal funds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) determines that the likelihood of loss outweighs the importance of following the limitation, suspension, or termination procedures authorized in subsection (h) of this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary shall, effective on the date on which a notice and statement of the basis of the action is mailed to the lender (by registered mail, return receipt requested), take emergency action to stop the issuance of guarantee commitments and the payment of interest benefits and special allowance to the lender.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Length of emergency action</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the development of electronic forms and procedures.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Ineligibility based on high default rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An institution whose cohort default rate is equal to or greater than the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available shall not be eligible to participate in a program under this part for the fiscal year for which the determination is made and for the two succeeding fiscal years, unless, within 30 days of receiving notification from the Secretary of the loss of eligibility under this paragraph, the institution appeals the loss of its eligibility to the Secretary. The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal within 45 days after its submission. Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the Secretary's calculation of its cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce its cohort default rate for any of the three fiscal years below the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) there are exceptional mitigating circumstances within the meaning of paragraph (4); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, other exceptional mitigating circumstances that would make the application of this paragraph inequitable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">During such appeal, the Secretary may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part. If an institution continues to participate in a program under this part, and the institution's appeal of the loss of eligibility is unsuccessful, the institution shall be required to pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount of interest, special allowance, reinsurance, and any related payments made by the Secretary (or which the Secretary is obligated to make) with respect to loans made under this part to students attending, or planning to attend, that institution during the pendency of such appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of determinations under subparagraph (A), the threshold percentage is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) a Navajo Community College under the Navajo Community College Act [25 U.S.C. 640a et seq.].</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding the first sentence of subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall restore the eligibility to participate in a program under subpart 1 of part A, part B, or part D of this subchapter of an institution that did not appeal its loss of eligibility within 30 days of receiving notification if the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the institution's failure to appeal was substantially justified under the circumstances, and that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:380 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the institution made a timely request that the appropriate guaranty agency correct errors in the draft data used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the guaranty agency did not correct the erroneous data in a timely fashion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the institution would have been eligible if the erroneous data had been corrected by the guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appeals based upon allegations of improper loan servicing</h4>

The amount of time <!-- PDFPage:381 -->normally required to complete the program for a student who is initially enrolled full-time is the period of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a full-time student. For a student who is initially enrolled less than full-time, the period is the amount of time it would take the student to complete the program if the student remained enrolled at that level of enrollment throughout the program.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of special allowance</h4>

The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this subsection if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of his then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this subsection to an amount greater than $1,000,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities as of the last day of the month preceding the making of such purchase.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Revised tables</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each academic year after academic year 1993&ndash;1994, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised table of income protection allowances for the purpose of sections 1087<em>oo</em>(c)(4) and 1087qq(b)(4) of this title. Such revised table shall be developed by increasing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table in each such section by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 1992 and the December next preceding the beginning of such academic year, and rounding the result to the nearest $10.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revised amounts</h4>

For each age cohort below 40, the allowance shall be computed by decreasing the allowance for age 40, as updated, by one-fifteenth for each year of age below age 40 and rounding the result to the nearest $100. In making such determinations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inflation shall be presumed to be 6 percent per year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of return of an annuity shall be presumed to be 8 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the sales commission on an annuity shall be presumed to be 6 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assessment schedules and rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each award year after award year 1993&ndash;1994, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised table of assessments from adjusted available income for the purpose of sections 1087<em>oo</em>(e) and 1087qq(d) of this title.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1087tt. Discretion of student financial aid administrators</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances. However, this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special circumstances may include tuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school, medical or dental expenses not covered by insurance, unusually high child care costs, recent unemployment of a family member, the number of parents enrolled at least half-time in a degree, certificate, or other program leading to a recognized educational credential at an institution with a program participation agreement under section 1094 of this title, or other changes in a family's income, a family's assets, or a student's status. Special circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student financial aid administrator in such cases to request and use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting, processing, or delivering such supplementary information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to assets taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in accordance with subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy or an involuntary liquidation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the administrator makes adjustments in the award level of a student with a disability so as to take into consideration the additional costs such student incurs as a result of such student's disability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Refusal or adjustment of loan certifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On a case-by-case basis, an eligible institution may refuse to certify a statement that permits a student to receive a loan under part B or C of this subchapter, or may certify a loan amount or make a loan that is less than the student's determination of need (as determined under this part), if the reason for the action is documented and provided in written form to the student. No eligible institution shall discriminate against any borrower or applicant in obtaining a loan on the basis of race, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, age, or disability status.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensure that the resources and capabilities of institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies are not overburdened by the combination of student aid processing and delivery requirements added or modified by the amendments made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 and by the changes required to ensure that the systems of the institutions, lenders and guaranty agencies are Year 2000 compliant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) avoid the disruption of grant, loan, or work assistance funds awarded to students because of Year 2000 compliance problems at a substantial number of institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to postpone</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may postpone, for a period of time described in paragraph (3), the implementation of any requirements under part B, C, D, or F of this subchapter that are added or modified by the amendments made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 related to the processing or delivery of grant, loan, and work assistance (which shall not include the determination of need for such assistance) provided under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) implementation of such requirements would require extensive changes to the existing systems of institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) postponement is necessary to avoid jeopardizing the ability of a substantial number of institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies to ensure that all of the systems of the institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies related to the processing or delivery of such assistance function successfully after December 31, 1999; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promptly publishes in the Federal Register a list of, and notifies Congress of, any provisions, the implementation of which the Secretary intends to postpone, with the reasons for such postponement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exceptions to authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not postpone the implementation of one or more provisions described in this subsection longer than the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the period of time that the Secretary determines necessary to ensure that the processing and delivery systems of the institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1098c_1_target" name="1098c_1">1</a></sup> are capable of functioning successfully after December 31, 1999; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Independent evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of the performance of all accrediting agencies or associations which seek recognition by the Secretary in order to determine whether such accrediting agencies or associations meet the criteria established by this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall consider all available relevant information concerning the compliance of the accrediting agency or association with the criteria provided for in this section, including any complaints or legal actions against such agency or association.

If the agency or association reviews institutions offering distance education courses or programs and the Secretary determines that the agency or association meets the requirements of this section, then the agency shall be recognized and the scope of recognition shall include accreditation of institutions offering distance education courses or programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall maintain sufficient documentation to support the conclusions reached in the recognition process, and, if the Secretary does not recognize any accreditation agency or association, shall make publicly available the reason for denying recognition, including reference to the specific criteria under this section which have not been fulfilled.</p>
