<p class="note-body">Section 7111 of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(1), (2)(A)(i), was in the original &ldquo;section 4111&rdquo;, meaning section 4111 of Pub.

L. 89 10 does not contain a section 4111, but does contain a section 4011 which relates to State allotments.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5121 of this Act (as such section was in effect on the day preceding October 20, 1994), referred to in subsec. (a)(2)(A), means section 5121 of Pub.
