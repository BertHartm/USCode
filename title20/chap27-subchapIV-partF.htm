<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) enrolls 50 percent or more of its students in correspondence courses, unless the institution is an institution that meets the definition in such section, except that the Secretary, at the request of such institution, may waive the applicability of this subparagraph to such institution for good cause, as determined by the Secretary in the case of an institution of high<!-- PDFPage:394 -->er education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction for which the institution awards an associate or baccalaureate degree;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) has a student enrollment in which more than 25 percent of the students are incarcerated, except that the Secretary may waive the prohibition of this subparagraph for a nonprofit institution that provides a 4-year or a 2-year program of instruction (or both) for which it awards a bachelor's or associate's degree, respectively; or</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Common financial aid form and processing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Single form required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, in cooperation with representatives of agencies and organizations involved in student financial assistance, shall produce, distribute, and process free of charge a common financial reporting form to be used to determine the need and eligibility of a student for financial assistance under parts A, C, and D of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (other than under subpart 4 of part A of this subchapter) and to determine the need of a student for the purpose of part B of this subchapter. The Secretary may include on the form developed pursuant to this paragraph not more than eight nonfinancial data items selected in consultation with the States to assist the States in awarding State student financial assistance. Such form shall satisfy the requirements of section 1070a(d) of this title. For the purpose of collecting eligibility and other data for the purpose of part B of this subchapter, the Secretary shall develop a separate, identifiable loan application document (pursuant to section 1082(m) of this title) that applicants or institutions in which the students are enrolled or accepted for enrollment shall submit directly to eligible lenders and on which the applicant shall clearly indicate a choice of a lender.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges to students and parents for use of form prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The common financial reporting form prescribed by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be produced, distributed, and processed by the Secretary and no parent or student shall be charged a fee for the collection, processing, or delivery of financial aid through the use of such form. The need and eligibility of a student for financial assistance under parts A, C, and D of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (other than under subpart 4 of part A of this subchapter) and the need of a student for the purpose of part B of this subchapter, may only be determined by using the form developed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. No student may receive assistance under parts A, C, and D of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (other than under subpart 4 of part A of this subchapter) or have the student's need established for the purpose of part B of this subchapter, except by use of the form developed by the Secretary pursuant to this section. No data collected on a form for which a fee is charged shall be used to complete the form prescribed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Distribution of data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Institutions of higher education and States shall receive, without charge, the data collected by the Secretary using the form developed pursuant to this section for the purposes of determining need and eligibility for institutional and State financial aid awards. Entities designated by institutions of higher education or States to receive such data shall be subject to all requirements of this section, unless such requirements are waived by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contracts for collection and processing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, enter into not less than 5 contracts with States, institutions of higher education, or private organizations for the purposes of the timely collection and processing of the form developed pursuant to paragraph (1) and the timely delivery of the data submitted on such form. The Secretary shall use such contracts to assist States and institutions of higher education with the collection of additional data required to award State or institutional financial assistance, except that the Secretary shall not include these additional data items on the common financial reporting form developed pursuant to this section. The Secretary shall include in each such contract a requirement that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any charges by the contractor to the student or parent for additional data items required by a State or institution for any purpose (regardless of the method of collection) shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the marginal cost of collecting, processing, and delivering such additional data, taking into account any payment received by the contractor to produce, distribute, and process the common financial reporting form prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the contractor will require any person or entity to whom the contractor provides such additional data to agree not to collect from any student or parent any charge that would not be permitted under this subparagraph for any such additional data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall ensure that at least one contractor, or a portion of one contract, under this paragraph will serve graduate and professional students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) As part of the procurement process for the 1993&ndash;1994 award year, and for all procurements thereafter pertaining to the contracts under this paragraph, the Secretary shall require all entities competing for such contracts to comply with all requirements of this subsection and to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) use the common financial reporting form as prescribed in paragraph (1), which shall be clearly identified as the &ldquo;Free Application for Federal Student Aid&rdquo;; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) use a common, simplified reapplication form as the Secretary shall prescribe pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, in each award year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Secretary shall reimburse all approved contractors at a reasonable predetermined rate for processing such applications, for issuing eligibility reports, and for carrying out other services or requirements that may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) All approved contractors shall be required to adhere to all editing, processing, and <!-- PDFPage:400 -->reporting requirements established by the Secretary to ensure consistency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) No approved contractor shall enter into exclusive arrangements with guarantors, lenders, secondary markets, or institutions of higher education for the purpose of reselling or sharing of data collected for the multiple data entry process. All data collected under a contract issued by the Secretary pursuant to this paragraph for the multiple data entry process is the exclusive property of the Secretary and may not be transferred to a third party by an approved contractor without the Secretary's express written approval.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Streamlined reapplication process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, within 240 days after July 23, 1992, develop a streamlined reapplication form and process, including electronic reapplication process, consistent with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, for those recipients who apply for financial aid funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 in the next succeeding academic year subsequent to the initial year in which such recipients apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall develop appropriate mechanisms to support reapplication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall determine, in cooperation with States, institutions of higher education, agencies and organizations involved in student financial assistance, the data elements that can be updated from the previous academic year's application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the Secretary to reduce the number of data elements required of reapplicants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Individuals determined to have a zero family contribution pursuant to section 1087ss of this title shall not be required to provide any financial data, except that which is necessary to determine eligibility under that section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Information to committees of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Copies of all rules, regulations, guidelines, instructions, and application forms published or promulgated pursuant to this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 shall be provided to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives at least 45 days prior to their effective date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Toll-free information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall contract for, or establish, and publicize a toll-free telephone service to provide timely and accurate information to the general public. The information provided shall include specific instructions on completing the application form for assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Refund policy required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each institution of higher education participating in a program under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 shall have in effect a fair and equitable refund policy under which the institution refunds unearned tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges to a student who received grant or loan assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, or whose parent received a loan made under section 1078&ndash;2 of this title on behalf of the student, if the student&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) does not register for the period of attendance for which the assistance was intended; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) withdraws or otherwise fails to complete the period of enrollment for which the assistance was provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The institution's refund policy shall be considered to be fair and equitable for purposes of this section if that policy provides for a refund in an amount of at least the largest of the amounts provided under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the requirements of applicable State law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the specific refund requirements established by the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency and approved by the Secretary; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), &ldquo;the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains&rdquo;, shall be determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a program that is measured in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged into the number of weeks remaining in that period as of the last recorded day of attendance by the student;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a program that is measured in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged into the number of clock hours remaining to be completed by the student in that period as of the last recorded day of attendance by the student; and</p>

No such waiver may include permission to exempt any such institution from designating a specific individual or a group of individuals to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lender eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such lender may offer a combined payment plan only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the lender holds an outstanding loan of that borrower which is selected by the borrower for incorporation into a combined payment plan pursuant to this section (including loans which are selected by the borrower for consolidation under this section); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower certifies that the borrower has sought and has been unable to obtain a combined payment plan from the holders of the outstanding loans of that borrower.</p>

The proceeds of each such loan will be paid by the lender to the holder of the original loan being reissued and the borrower's obligation to that holder on that loan shall be discharged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise specifically provided for under the provisions of this section, the terms of any reissued loan shall be the same as the terms of the original loan. The maximum repayment period for a loan reissued under this section shall not exceed the remainder of the period which would have been permitted on the original loan. If the lender holds more than one loan insured under subpart I&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act, the maximum repayment period for all such loans may extend to the latest date permitted for any individual loan. Any reissued loan may be consolidated with any other Health Education Assistance Loan as provided in the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], and, with the concurrence of the borrower, repayment of any such loans during any period may be made in amounts that are less than the interest that accrues on such loans during that period.</p>
