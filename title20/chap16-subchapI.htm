<p class="statutory-body">Funds appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) of section 351b(a) of this title shall be available for grants to States from allotments under section 351c(a) of this title for the purpose of paying the Federal share of the cost of carrying out State plans submitted and approved under sections 351d and 354 of this title. Except as is provided in subsection (b) of this section, grants to States under this subchapter may be used solely&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for planning for, and taking other steps leading to the development of, programs and projects designed to assist libraries to serve as community centers for information and referral and to extend and improve library services, as provided in clause (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for (A) extending public library services to geographical areas and groups of persons without such services and improving such services in such areas and for such groups as may have inadequate public library services; and (B) establishing, expanding, and operating programs and projects to provide (i) State institutional library services, (ii) library services to the physically handicapped, and (iii) library services for the disadvantaged in urban and rural areas; and (C) strengthening metropolitan public libraries which serve as national or regional resource centers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for supporting and expanding library services of major urban resource libraries which, because of the value of the collections of such libraries to individual users and to other libraries, need special assistance to furnish services at a level required to meet the demands made for such services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No grant may be made under clause (3) of this subsection unless the major urban resource library provides services to users throughout the regional area in which such library is located. In carrying out its program to accomplish the purposes of this subchapter, a State may make subgrants to library systems or networks which include libraries other than public libraries, if the purpose of the subgrant is to improve services for public library patrons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of costs of administering State plans, planning for and evaluation of library services, dissemination of information concerning library services, etc.; increase capacity of State library administrative agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of section 351f of this title and such limitations and criteria as the Secretary shall establish by regulation, grants to States under this chapter may be used (1) to pay the cost of administering the State plans submitted and approved under this chapter (including obtaining the services of consultants), statewide planning for and evaluation of library services, dissemination of information concerning library services, and the activities of such advisory groups and panels as may be necessary to assist the State library administrative agency in carrying out its functions under this subchapter, and (2) for strengthening the capacity of State library administrative agencies for meeting the needs of the people of the States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reservation of allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to such criteria as the Secretary shall establish by regulation, in any fiscal year in which sums appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) of section 351b(a) of this title (excluding the amount made available for Indian tribes and Hawaiian natives) exceed $60,000,000, each <!-- PDFPage:101 -->State which is subject to the provisions of this subsection shall reserve that portion of the allotment of each State attributable to the amount in excess of $60,000,000 in that fiscal year in the manner required in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In each State having one or more cities with a population of 100,000 or more individuals, as determined by the Secretary, and in which the aggregate population of such cities does not exceed 50 percent of the total population of the State, the portion of the excess amount specified in paragraph (1) shall be reserved for the purposes described in subsection (a)(3) of this section in accordance with clause (2) of section 354 of this title in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total of such excess amount as the aggregate population of such cities bears to the total population of such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In each State having one or more cities with a population of 100,000 or more individuals, as determined by the Secretary, and in which the aggregate population of such cities exceeds 50 percent of the total population of the State, 50 percent of the excess amount specified in paragraph (1) shall be reserved for the purposes described in subsection (a)(3) of this section in accordance with clause (2) of section 354 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any State which does not include any city with a population of 100,000 or more individuals, as determined by the Secretary, shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No State shall, in carrying out the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, reduce the amount paid to any major urban resource library below the amount that such library received in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made under such paragraph (2), except that such amount may be ratably reduced to the extent that (A) the total Federal allocations to the State under section 351c of this title for purposes of this subchapter for the applicable fiscal year are reduced, or (B) the 1990 Census shows the population of the city served by such library has decreased.</p>
