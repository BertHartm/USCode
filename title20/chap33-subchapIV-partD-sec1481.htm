(a)(1), was in the original &ldquo;section 178(c) of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002&rdquo;, meaning section 178(c) of Pub. L. 107&ndash;279, which was translated as reading section 177(c) of Pub. L. 107&ndash;279, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 107&ndash;279 does not contain a section 178 and section 177(c) of that Act requires development of a plan.</p>
