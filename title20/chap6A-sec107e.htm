<p class="note-body">The content of Pub. L. 93&ndash;516, including provisions of sections 206 and 207 thereof which amended and renumbered this section, were originally contained in H.R. 14225, 93rd Congress, Second Session, which was pocket-vetoed during the 31-day intrasession adjournment of the 93rd Congress for the Congressional elections in November, 1974. See 1974 Amendment note below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (<em>Kennedy v. Jones</em>, D.C.D.C. 1976, 412 F.Supp. 353) H.R. 14225 was deemed to have become law without the approval of the President on Nov. 21, 1974, and was given the designation Pub. L. 93&ndash;651. Therefore, for purposes of codification, this section should be deemed to have been amended and renumbered by Pub. L. 93&ndash;651, title II, &sect;&sect;206, 207, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2&ndash;11, 2&ndash;13, in exactly the same manner as it was amended and renumbered by Pub. L. 93&ndash;516.</p>
