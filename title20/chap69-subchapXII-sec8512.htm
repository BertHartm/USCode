<p class="note-body">Section 7713(5) of this title, referred to in par. (3)(B), was in the original &ldquo;section 8015(5)&rdquo;, meaning section 8015(5) of Pub. L. 89&ndash;10, which was translated as reading section 8013(5) of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 89&ndash;10 does not contain a section 8015, and section 8013(5) describes Federal property owned by the United States.</p>
