<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that, in an effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on college campuses, all institutions of higher education should carry out the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The president of the institution should appoint a task force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students, Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full examination of student and academic life at the institution. The task force should make recommendations for a broad range of policy and program changes that would serve to reduce alcohol and other drug-related problems. The institution should provide resources to assist the task force in promoting the campus policies and proposed environmental changes that have been identified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The institution should enforce a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by students at the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The institution should vigorously enforce the institution's code of disciplinary sanctions for those who violate campus alcohol policies. Students with alcohol or other drug-related problems should be referred for assistance, including on-campus counseling programs if appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The institution should adopt a policy to discourage alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus activities. It should adopt policies limiting the advertisement and promotion of alcoholic beverages on campus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The institution should work with the local community, including local businesses, in a &ldquo;Town/Gown&rdquo; alliance to encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and to address illegal alcohol use by students.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are a significant number of institutions of higher education serving high percentages of minority students and students from low-income backgrounds, that face problems that threaten their ability to survive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the problems relate to the management and fiscal operations of certain institutions of higher education, as well as to an inability to engage in long-range planning and development activities, including endowment building;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in order to be competitive and provide a high-quality education for all, institutions of higher education should improve their technological capacity and make effective use of technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the subchapter III program prior to 1985 did not always meet the specific development needs of historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions with large concentrations of minority, low-income students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the solution of the problems of these institutions would enable them to become viable, fiscally stable and independent, thriving institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) providing assistance to eligible institutions will enhance the role of such institutions in providing access and quality education to low-income and minority students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) these institutions play an important role in the American system of higher education, and there is a strong national interest in assisting them in solving their problems and in stabilizing their management and fiscal operations, and in becoming financially independent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) there is a particular national interest in aiding those institutions of higher education that have historically served students who have been denied access to postsecondary education because of race or national origin and whose participation in the American system of higher education is in the Nation's interest so that equality of access and quality of post<!-- PDFPage:217 -->secondary education opportunities may be enhanced for all students.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to assist such institutions in equalizing educational opportunity through a program of Federal assistance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the historically Black colleges and universities have contributed significantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity through postsecondary education for Black, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged Americans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) States and the Federal Government have discriminated in the allocation of land and financial resources to support Black public institutions under the Morrill Act of 1862 [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and its progeny, and against public and private Black colleges and universities in the award of Federal grants and contracts, and the distribution of Federal resources under this chapter and other Federal programs which benefit institutions of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the current state of Black colleges and universities is partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action requires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary institutions to ensure their continuation and participation in fulfilling the Federal mission of equality of educational opportunity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) financial assistance to establish or strengthen the physical plants, financial man<!-- PDFPage:225 -->agement, academic resources, and endowments of the historically Black colleges and universities are appropriate methods to enhance these institutions and facilitate a decrease in reliance on governmental financial support and to encourage reliance on endowments and private sources.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of this section is to establish a program to provide matching grants to eligible institutions in order to establish or increase endowment funds at such institutions, to provide additional incentives to promote fund raising activities by such institutions, and to foster increased independence and self-sufficiency at such institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;endowment fund&rdquo; means a fund established by State law, by an institution of higher education, or by a foundation which is exempt from taxation and is maintained for the purpose of generating income for the support of the institution, but which shall not include real estate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;endowment fund corpus&rdquo; means an amount equal to the grant or grants awarded under this section plus an amount equal to such grant or grants provided by the institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) The term &ldquo;eligible institution&rdquo; means an institution that is an&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Secretary may waive the requirements of subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) with respect to a postgraduate degree in the case of any institution otherwise eligible under clause (i) for an endowment challenge grant upon determining that the institution makes a substantial contribution to medical education opportunities for minorities and the economically disadvantaged.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Grants authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From sums available for this section under section 1068h of this title, the Secretary is authorized to award endowment challenge grants to eligible institutions to establish or increase an endowment fund at such institution. Such grants shall be made only to eligible institutions described in paragraph (4) whose applications have been approved pursuant to subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no institution shall receive a grant under this section, unless such institution has deposited in its endowment fund established under this section an amount equal to the amount of such grant. The source of funds for this institutional match shall not include Federal funds or funds from an existing endowment fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may make a grant under this part to an eligible institution in any fiscal year if the institution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) applies for a grant in an amount not exceeding $500,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) has deposited in the eligible institution's endowment fund established under this section an amount which is equal to 1/2 of the amount of such grant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An eligible institution of higher education that is awarded a grant under subparagraph (B) shall not be eligible to receive an additional grant under subparagraph (B) until 10 years after the date on which the grant period terminates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The period of a grant under this section shall be not more than 20 years. During the grant period, an institution may not withdraw or expend any of the endowment fund corpus. After the termination of the grant period, an institution may use the endowment fund corpus plus any endowment fund income for any educational purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) An institution of higher education is eligible to receive a grant under this section if it is an eligible institution as described in subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No institution shall be ineligible for an endowment challenge grant under this section for a fiscal year by reason of the previous receipt of such a grant but no institution shall be eligible to receive such a grant for more than 2 fiscal years out of any period of 5 consecutive fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An endowment challenge grant awarded under this section to an eligible institution shall be in an amount which is not less than $50,000 in any fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) An eligible institution may designate a foundation, which was established for the purpose of raising money for the institution, as the recipient of the grant awarded under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall not award a grant to a foundation on behalf of an institution unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the institution assures the Secretary that the foundation is legally authorized to receive the endowment fund corpus and is legally authorized to administer the fund in accordance with this section and any implementing regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the foundation agrees to administer the fund in accordance with the requirements of this section and any implementing regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the institution agrees to be liable for any violation by the foundation of the provisions of this section and any implementing regulation, including any monetary liability that may arise as a result of such violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Grant agreement; endowment fund provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An institution awarded a grant under this section shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary containing satisfactory assurances that it will (A) immediately comply with the matching requirements of subsection (b)(2) of this section, (B) establish an endowment fund independent of any other such fund of the institution, (C) invest the endowment fund corpus, and (D) meet the other requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An institution shall invest the endowment fund corpus and endowment fund income in low-risk securities in which a regulated insurance company may invest under the law of the State in which the institution is located such as a federally insured bank savings account or comparable interest-bearing account, certificate of deposit, money market fund, mutual fund, or obligations of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The institution, in investing the endowment fund established under this section, shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which a person of prudence, discretion, and intelligence would exercise in the management of such person's own affairs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An institution may withdraw and expend the endowment fund income to defray any expenses necessary to the operation of such college, including expenses of operations and maintenance, administration, academic and support personnel, construction and renovation, community and student services programs, and technical assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), an institution may not spend more than 50 percent of the total aggregate endowment fund income earned prior to the time of expenditure.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:235 --><p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may permit an institution to spend more than 50 percent of the endowment fund income notwithstanding clause (i) if the institution demonstrates such an expenditure is necessary because of (I) a financial emergency, such as a pending insolvency or temporary liquidity problem; (II) a life-threatening situation occasioned by a natural disaster or arson; or (III) any other unusual occurrence or exigent circumstance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repayment provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If at any time an institution withdraws part of the endowment fund corpus, the institution shall repay to the Secretary an amount equal to 50 percent of the withdrawn amount, which represents the Federal share, plus income earned thereon. The Secretary may use such repaid funds to make additional challenge grants, or to increase existing endowment grants, to other eligible institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an institution expends more of the endowment fund income than is permitted under subsection (c) of this section, the institution shall repay the Secretary an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount improperly expended (representing the Federal share thereof). The Secretary may use such repaid fund to make additional challenge grants, or to increase existing challenge grants, to other eligible institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Audit information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An institution receiving a grant under this section shall provide to the Secretary (or a designee thereof) such information (or access thereto) as may be necessary to audit or examine expenditures made from the endowment fund corpus or income in order to determine compliance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Selection criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In selecting eligible institutions for grants under this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) give priority to an applicant with a greater need for such a grant, based on the current market value of the applicant's existing endowment in relation to the number of full-time equivalent students enrolled at such institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the effort made by the applicant to build or maintain its existing endowment fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the degree to which an applicant proposes to match the grant with nongovernmental funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Application</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the academic and residential facilities on the campuses of all historically Black colleges and universities have suffered from neglect, deferred maintenance and are in need of capital improvements in order to provide appropriate settings for learning and social development through higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) due to their small enrollments, limited endowments and other financial factors normally considered by lenders in construction financing, historically Black colleges and universities often lack access to the sources of funding necessary to undertake the necessary capital improvements through borrowing and bond financing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) despite their track record of long-standing and remarkable institutional longevity and viability, historically Black colleges and universities often lack the financial resources necessary to gain access to traditional sources of capital financing such as bank loans and bond financing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Federal assistance to facilitate low-cost capital basis for historically Black colleges and universities will enable such colleges and universities to continue and expand their educational mission and enhance their significant role in American higher education.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in section 1066c of this title, the Secretary is authorized to enter into insurance agreements to provide financial insurance to guarantee the full payment of principal and interest on qualified bonds upon the conditions set forth in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Responsibilities of designated bonding authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not enter into an insurance agreement described in subsection (a) of this section unless the Secretary designates a qualified bonding authority in accordance with sections 1066d(1) and 1066e&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1066b_1_target" name="1066b_1">1</a></sup> of this title and the designated bonding authority agrees in such agreement to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use the proceeds of the qualified bonds, less costs of issuance not to exceed 2 percent of the principal amount thereof, to make loans to eligible institutions or for deposit into an escrow account for repayment of the bonds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that not less than 95 percent of the proceeds of the loan will be used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to finance the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, construction or acquisition, of a capital project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refinance an obligation the proceeds of which were used to finance the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, construction or acquisition, of a capital project;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) charge such interest on loans, and provide for such a schedule of repayments of loans, as will, upon the timely repayment of the loans, provide adequate and timely funds for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require that any payment on a loan expected to be necessary to make a payment of principal and interest on the bonds be due not less than 60 days prior to the date of the payment on the bonds for which such loan payment is expected to be needed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) prior to the making of any loan, provide for a credit review of the institution receiving the loan and assure the Secretary that, on the basis of such credit review, it is reasonable to anticipate that the institution receiving the loan will be able to repay the loan in a timely manner pursuant to the terms thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that, if a delinquency on such loan results in a funding under the insurance agreement, the institution obligated on such loan shall repay the Secretary, upon terms to be determined by the Secretary, for such funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) assign any loans to the Secretary, upon the demand of the Secretary, if a delinquency on such loan has required a funding under the insurance agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in the event of a delinquency on a loan, engage in such collection efforts as the Secretary shall require for a period of not less than 45 days prior to requesting a funding under the insurance agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) establish an escrow account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) into which each eligible institution shall deposit 5 percent of the proceeds of any loan made under this part, with each eligible institution required to maintain in the escrow account an amount equal to 5 percent of the outstanding principal of all loans made to such institution under this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the balance of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be available to the Secretary to pay principal and interest on the bonds in the event of delinquency in loan repayment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be used to return to an eligible institution an amount equal to any remaining portion of such institution's 5 percent deposit of loan proceeds following scheduled repayment of such institution's loan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that, if a delinquency on such loan results in amounts being withdrawn from the escrow account to pay principal and interest on bonds, subsequent payments on such loan shall be available to replenish such escrow account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) comply with the limitations set forth in section 1066c of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) make loans only to eligible institutions under this part in accordance with conditions prescribed by the Secretary to ensure that loans are fairly allocated among as many eligible institutions as possible, consistent with making loans of amounts that will permit capital projects of sufficient size and scope to significantly contribute to the educational program of the eligible institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional agreement provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any insurance agreement described in subsection (a) of this section shall provide as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The payment of principal and interest on bonds shall be insured by the Secretary until <!-- PDFPage:239 -->such time as such bonds have been retired or canceled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal liability for delinquencies and default for bonds guaranteed under this part shall only become effective upon the exhaustion of all the funds held in the escrow account described in subsection (b)(8) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary shall create a letter of credit authorizing the Department of the Treasury to disburse funds to the designated bonding authority or its assignee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The letter of credit shall be drawn upon in the amount determined by paragraph (5) of this subsection upon the certification of the designated bonding authority to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee that there is a delinquency on 1 or more loans and there are insufficient funds available from loan repayments and the escrow account to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest on the bonds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Upon receipt by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee of the certification described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the designated bonding authority may draw a funding under the letter of credit in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount required to make the next scheduled payment of principal and interest on the bonds, less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount available to the designated bonding authority from loan repayments and the escrow account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) All funds provided under the letter of credit shall be paid to the designated bonding authority within 2 business days following receipt of the certification described in paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Full faith and credit provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (c)(1) of this section the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all funds which may be required to be paid under the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Sale of bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a qualified bond guaranteed under this part may be sold to any party that offers terms that the Secretary determines are in the best interest of the eligible institution.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is incumbent on the Federal Government to support the technological and economic competitiveness of the United States by improving and expanding the scientific and technological capacity of the United States. More and better prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts are needed to improve and expand such capacity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) As the Nation's population becomes more diverse, it is important that the educational and training needs of all Americans are met. Underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields diminishes our Nation's competitiveness by impairing the quantity of well prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts in these fields.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, minority institutions provide an important educational opportunity for minority students, particularly in science and engineering fields. Aid to minority institutions is a good way to address the underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) There is a strong Federal interest in improving science and engineering programs at minority institutions as such programs lag behind in program offerings and in student enrollment compared to such programs at other institutions of higher education.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For each fiscal year through fiscal year 2004, the Secretary shall pay to each eligible institution such sums as may be necessary to pay to each eligible student (defined in accordance with section 1091 of this title) for each academic year during which that student is in attendance at an institution of higher education, as an undergraduate, a Federal Pell Grant in the amount for which that student is eligible, as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Not less than 85 percent of such sums shall be advanced to eligible institutions prior to the start of each payment period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the institution as needed to pay eligible students until such time as the Secretary determines and publishes in the Federal Register with an opportunity for comment, an alternative payment system that provides payments to institutions in an accurate and timely manner,,<sup><a href="#1070a_1_target" name="1070a_1">1</a></sup> except that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to place an institution on a reimbursement system of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly <!-- PDFPage:259 -->to students, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an amount for which they are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Grants made under this subpart shall be known as &ldquo;Federal Pell Grants&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose and amount of grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of this subpart is to provide a Federal Pell Grant that in combination with reasonable family and student contribution and supplemented by the programs authorized under subparts 3 and 4 of this part, will meet at least 75 percent of a student's cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title), unless the institution determines that a greater amount of assistance would better serve the purposes of section 1070&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1070a_2_target" name="1070a_2">2</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the Federal Pell Grant for a student eligible under this part shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $4,500 for academic year 1999&ndash;2000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $4,800 for academic year 2000&ndash;2001;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) $5,800 for academic year 2003&ndash;2004,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the expected family contribution with respect to that student for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where a student attends an institution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (including a student who attends an institution of higher education on less than a half-time basis) during any academic year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant to which that student is entitled shall be reduced in proportion to the degree to which that student is not so attending on a full-time basis, in accordance with a schedule of reductions established by the Secretary for the purposes of this division, computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For any academic year for which an appropriation Act provides a maximum basic grant in an amount in excess of $2,700, the amount of a student's basic grant shall equal $2,700 plus&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) one-half of the amount by which such maximum basic grant exceeds $2,700; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the remaining one-half of such excess; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the sum of the student's tuition and, if the student has dependent care expenses (as described in section 1087<em>ll</em>(8) of this title) or disability-related expenses (as described in section 1087<em>ll</em>(9) of this title), an allowance determined by the institution for such expenses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An institution that charged only fees in lieu of tuition as of October 1, 1998, may include in the institution's determination of tuition charged, fees that would normally constitute tuition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No Federal Pell Grant under this subpart shall exceed the difference between the expected family contribution for a student and the cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087<em>ll</em> of this title) at the institution at which that student is in attendance. If, with respect to any student, it is determined that the amount of a Federal Pell Grant plus the amount of the expected family contribution for that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant shall be reduced until the combination of expected family contribution and the amount of the Federal Pell Grant does not exceed the cost of attendance at such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No Federal Pell Grant shall be awarded to a student under this subpart if the amount of that grant for that student as determined under this subsection for any academic year is less than $400, except that a student who is eligible for a Federal Pell Grant that is equal to or greater than $200 but less than $400 shall be awarded a Federal Pell Grant of $400.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive 2 Pell grants during a single award year, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the student is enrolled full-time in an associate or baccalaureate degree program of study that is 2 years or longer at an eligible institution that is computed in credit hours; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the student completes course work toward completion of an associate or baccalaureate degree that exceeds the requirements for a full academic year as defined by the institution.</p>

Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the student is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No student is entitled to receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one institution or from the Secretary and an institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive a Federal Pell Grant if the student&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is carrying at least one-half the normal full-time work load for the course of study the student is pursuing, as determined by the institution of higher education; and</p>

The student may elect to have the institution provide other such goods and services by crediting the student's account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Calculation of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart (including a central processor, if any, designated by the Secretary) shall, in a timely manner, furnish to the student financial aid administrator (at each institution of higher education which a student awarded a Federal Pell Grant under this subpart is attending), as a part of its regular output document, the expected family contribution for each such student.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a student receives an award under this subpart that, due to recalculation errors by the institution of higher education, is in excess of the amount which the student is entitled to receive under this subpart, such institution of higher education shall pay to the Secretary the amount of such excess unless such excess can be resolved in a subsequent disbursement to the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart shall for each academic year after academic year 1986&ndash;1987 prepare and submit a report to the Secretary on the correctness of the computations of amount of the expected family contribution, and on the accuracy of the questions on the application form under this subpart for the previous academic year for which the contractor is responsible. The Secretary shall transmit the report, together with the comments and recommendations of the Secretary, to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Insufficient appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, for any fiscal year, the funds appropriated for payments under this subpart are insufficient to satisfy fully all entitlements, as calculated under subsection (b) of this section (but at the maximum grant level specified in such appropriation), the Secretary shall promptly transmit a notice of such insufficiency to each House of the Congress, and identify in such notice the additional amount that would be required to be appropriated to satisfy fully all entitlements (as so calculated at such maximum grant level).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Use of excess funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by 15 percent or less, then all of the excess funds shall remain available for making payments under this subpart during the next succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by more than 15 percent, then all of such funds shall remain available for making such payments but payments may be made <!-- PDFPage:261 -->under this paragraph only with respect to entitlements for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Treatment of institutions and students under other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any institution of higher education which enters into an agreement with the Secretary to disburse to students attending that institution the amounts those students are eligible to receive under this subpart shall not be deemed, by virtue of such agreement, a contractor maintaining a system of records to accomplish a function of the Secretary. Recipients of Pell Grants shall not be considered to be individual grantees for purposes of subtitle D of title V of Public Law 100&ndash;690 [41 U.S.C. 701 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Institutional ineligibility based on default rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No institution of higher education shall be an eligible institution for purposes of this subpart if such institution of higher education is ineligible to participate in a loan program under part B or C of this subchapter as a result of a final default rate determination made by the Secretary under part B or C of this subchapter after the final publication of cohort default rates for fiscal year 1996 or a succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sanctions subject to appeal opportunity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No institution may be subject to the terms of this subsection unless the institution has had the opportunity to appeal the institution's default rate determination under regulations issued by the Secretary for the loan program authorized under part B or C of this subchapter, as applicable. This subsection shall not apply to an institution that was not participating in the loan program authorized under part B or C of this subchapter on October 7, 1998, unless the institution subsequently participates in the loan programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $5,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this subpart in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-block">an amount equal to 90 percent of the amount it received under this subsection in its second year of participation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) of this subsection, then the amount of the allocation to each such institution shall be ratably reduced.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For any eligible institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the amount of that institution's need (as determined under subsection (c) of this section), divided by (ii) the sum of the need of all institutions (as so determined), multiplied by (iii) the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1070b(b) of this title of the fiscal year; exceeds</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish various income categories for dependent and independent undergraduate students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish an expected family contribution for each income category of dependent and independent undergraduate students, determined on the basis of the average expected family contribution (computed in accordance with part E of this subchapter) of a representative sample within each income category for the second preceding fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) compute 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) multiply the number of eligible dependent students in each income category by 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C), minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) for each income category of dependent students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) multiply the number of eligible independent students in each income category by 75 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C), minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (F) for each income category of independent students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) add the amounts determined under subparagraphs (E) and (G).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:283 --><p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;average cost of attendance&rdquo; means the average of the attendance costs for undergraduate students, which shall include (i) tuition and fees determined in accordance with subparagraph (B), (ii) standard living expenses determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), and (iii) books and supplies determined in accordance with subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The average undergraduate tuition and fees described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be computed on the basis of information reported by the institution to the Secretary, which shall include (i) total revenue received by the institution from undergraduate tuition and fees for the second year preceding the year for which it is applying for an allocation, and (ii) the institution's enrollment for such second preceding year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The standard living expense described in subparagraph (A)(ii) is equal to 150 percent of the difference between the income protection allowance for a family of five with one in college and the income protection allowance for a family of six with one in college for a single independent student.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The allowance for books and supplies described in subparagraph (A)(iii) is equal to $450.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallocation of excess allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an institution returns to the Secretary any portion of the sums allocated to such institution under this section for any fiscal year the Secretary shall, in accordance with regulations, reallocate such excess to other institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If under paragraph (1) of this subsection an institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation, the institution's allocation for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount returned. The Secretary may waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that enforcing this paragraph would be contrary to the interest of the program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) From the sums appropriated pursuant to section 1070c(b)(1) of this title and not reserved under section 1070c(b)(2) of this title for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the number of students who are deemed eligible in such State for participation in the grant program authorized by this subpart bears to the total number of such students in all the States, except that no State shall receive less than the State received for fiscal year 1979.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of this subsection, the number of students who are deemed eligible in a State for participation in the grant program authorized by this subpart, and the number of such students in all the States, shall be determined for the most recent year for which satisfactory data are available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any State's allotment under subsection (a) of this section for any fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required for such fiscal year for the leveraging educational assistance partnership program of that State shall be available for reallotment from time to time, on such dates during such year as the Secretary may fix, to other States in proportion to the original allotments to such States under such part for such year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use for such year for carrying out the State plan. The total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount reallotted to a State under this part during a year from funds appropriated pursuant to section 1070c(b)(1) of this title shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A State which desires to obtain a payment under this subpart for any fiscal year shall submit annually an application therefor through the State agency administering its program under this subpart as of July 1, 1985, unless the Governor of that State so designates, in writing, a different agency to administer the program. The application shall contain such information as may be required by, or pursuant to, regulation for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to make the determinations required under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of Federal share of grants made by qualified program</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) grants for such jobs be made in accordance with the provisions of section 2753(b)(1) of title 42;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provides for the selection of recipients of such grants or of such State work-study jobs on the basis of substantial financial need determined annually on the basis of criteria established by the State and approved by the Secretary, except that for the purpose of collecting data to make such determination of financial need, no student or parent shall be charged a fee that is payable to an entity other than such State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provides that, effective with respect to any academic year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, all nonprofit institutions of higher education in the State are eligible to participate in the State program, except in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of the constitution of the State or in any State in which participation of nonprofit institutions of higher education is in violation of a statute of the State which was enacted prior to October 1, 1978;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provides for the payment of the non-Federal portion of such grants or of such work-study jobs from funds supplied by such State which represent an additional expenditure for such year by such State for grants or work-study jobs for students attending institutions of higher education over the amount expended by such State for such grants or work-study jobs, if any, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such State initially received funds under this subpart;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provides that if the State's allocation under this subpart is based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students who are independent students or attending the institution less than full time, a reasonable proportion of the State's allocation shall be made available to such students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) provides for State expenditures under such program of an amount not less than the average annual aggregate expenditures for the preceding three fiscal years or the average annual expenditure per full-time equivalent student for such years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provides (A) for such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure proper disbursement of and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State agency under this subpart, and (B) for the making of such reports, in such form and containing such information, as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform his functions under this subpart; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) for any academic year beginning after June 30, 1987, provides the non-Federal share of the amount of student grants or work-study jobs under this subpart through a direct appropriation of State funds for the program under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reservation and disbursement of allotments and reallotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon his approval of any application for a payment under this subpart, the Secretary shall reserve from the applicable allotment (including any applicable reallotment) available therefor, the amount of such payment, which (subject to the limits of such allotment or reallotment) shall be equal to the Federal share of the cost of the students&rsquo; incentive grants or work-study jobs covered by such application. The Secretary shall pay such reserved amount, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may amend the reservation of any amount under this section, either upon approval of an amendment of the application or upon revision of the estimated cost of the student grants or work-study jobs with respect to which such reservation was made. If the Secretary approves an upward revision of such estimated cost, the Secretary may reserve the Federal share of the added cost only from the applicable allotment (or reallotment) available at the time of such approval.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The nature of postsecondary education delivery is changing, and new technology and other related innovations can provide promising education opportunities for individuals who are currently not being served, particularly for individuals without easy access to traditional campus-based postsecondary education or for whom traditional courses are a poor match with education or training needs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:297 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Individuals, including individuals seeking basic or technical skills or their first postsecondary experience, individuals with disabilities, dislocated workers, individuals making the transition from welfare-to-work, and individuals who are limited by time and place constraints can benefit from nontraditional, noncampus-based postsecondary education opportunities and appropriate support services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The need for high-quality, nontraditional, technology-based education opportunities is great, as is the need for skill competency credentials and other measures of educational progress and attainment that are valid and widely accepted, but neither need is likely to be adequately addressed by the uncoordinated efforts of agencies and institutions acting independently and without assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Partnerships, consisting of institutions of higher education, community organizations, or other public or private agencies or organizations, can coordinate and combine institutional resources&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide the needed variety of education options to students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to develop new means of ensuring accountability and quality for innovative education methods.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose of and authority for advances to reserve funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose; eligible recipients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From sums appropriated pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4)(A) of section 1071(b) of this title, the Secretary is authorized to make advances to any State with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title for the purpose of helping to establish or strengthen the reserve fund of the student loan insurance program covered by that agreement. If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title, and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which the Secretary has made an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title in order to enable students in the State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such an agreement. The Secretary may make advances under this subsection both to a State program (with which he has such an agreement) and to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations (with which he has such an agreement) in that State if he determines that such advances are necessary in order that students in each eligible institution have access through such institution to a student loan insurance program which meets the requirements of section 1078(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Matching requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No advance shall be made after June 30, 1968, unless matched by an equal amount from non-Federal sources. Such equal amount may include the unencumbered non-Federal portion <!-- PDFPage:301 -->of a reserve fund. As used in the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;unencumbered non-Federal portion&rdquo; means the amount (determined as of the time immediately preceding the making of the advance) of the reserve fund less the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) advances made under this section prior to July 1, 1968;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an amount equal to twice the amount of advances made under this section after June 30, 1968, and before the advance for purposes of which the determination is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proceeds of earnings on advances made under this section; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount which is required to be maintained in such fund pursuant to State law or regulation, or by agreement with lenders, as a reserve against the insurance of outstanding loans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Except as provided in section 1078(c)(9)(E) or (F) of this title, such unencumbered non-Federal portion shall not be subject to recall, repayment, or recovery by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms and conditions; repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Advances pursuant to this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions (including conditions relating to the time or times of payment) consistent with the requirements of section 1078(b) of this title as the Secretary determines will best carry out the purpose of this section. Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate in each case in the light of the maturity and solvency of the reserve fund for which the advance was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on total advances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total of the advances from the sums appropriated pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of section 1071(b) of this title to nonprofit private institutions and organizations for the benefit of students in any State and to such State may not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of such State aged 18 to 22, inclusive, bears to the population of all the States aged 18 to 22 inclusive, but such advances may otherwise be in such amounts as the Secretary determines will best achieve the purposes for which they are made. The amount available for advances to any State shall not be less than $25,000 and any additional funds needed to meet this requirement shall be derived by proportionately reducing (but not below $25,000) the amount available for advances to each of the remaining States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculation of population</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of this subsection, the population aged 18 to 22, inclusive, of each State and of all the States shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available to him.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Advances for insurance obligations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use for payment of insurance obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From sums appropriated pursuant to section 1071(b)(4)(B) of this title, the Secretary shall advance to each State which has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1078(c) of this title with respect to a student loan insurance program, an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection to be used for the purpose of making payments under the State's insurance obligations under such program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount to be advanced to each such State shall be equal to 10 percent of the principal amount of loans made by lenders and insured by such agency on those loans on which the first payment of principal became due during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the advance is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount of any advance determined according to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be reduced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount of any advance or advances made to such State pursuant to this subsection at an earlier date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount of the unspent balance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and the preceding sentence of this subparagraph, but subject to subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, the amount of any advance to a State described in paragraph (5)(A) for the first year of its eligibility under such paragraph, and the amount of any advance to any State described in paragraph (5)(B) for each year of its eligibility under such paragraph, shall not be less than $50,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For the purpose of subparagraph (B), the unspent balance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be that portion of the balance of the State's reserve fund (remaining at the time of the State's first request for an advance pursuant to this subsection) which bears the same ratio to such balance as the Federal advances made and not returned by such State, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, bears to the total of all past contributions to such reserve funds from all sources (other than interest on investment of any portion of the reserve fund) contributed since the date such State executed an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for paying the amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) are not sufficient to pay such amounts in full, then such amounts shall be reduced&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by ratably reducing that portion of the amount allocated to each State which exceeds $50,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if further reduction is required, by equally reducing the $50,000 minimum allocation of each State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If additional sums become available for paying such amounts for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence has been applied, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:302 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of earnings for insurance obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings, if any, on any investments of advances received pursuant to this subsection must be used for making payments under the State's insurance obligations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Repayment of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall, subject to subsection (d) of this section, be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate and shall be deposited in the fund established by section 1081 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on number of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), advances pursuant to this subsection shall be made to a State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a State which is actively carrying on a program under an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title which was entered into before October 12, 1976, upon such date as such State may request, but not before October 1, 1977, and on the same day of each of the 2 succeeding calendar years after the date so requested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a State which enters into an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title on or after October 12, 1976, or which is not actively carrying on a program under an agreement pursuant to such section on such date, upon such date as such State may request, but not before October 1, 1977, and on the same day of each of the 4 succeeding calendar years after the date so requested of the advance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Payment of advances where no State program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title, and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances pursuant to this subsection for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which he has made an agreement pursuant to subsection (c), as well as subsection (b), of section 1078 of this title and subparagraph (B) of this paragraph in order to enable students in that State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such agreements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a private nonprofit institution or organization for the purpose of this paragraph under which such institution or organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) agrees to establish within such State at least one office with sufficient staff to handle written, electronic, and telephone inquiries from students, eligible lenders, and other persons in the State, to encourage maximum commercial lender participation within the State, and to conduct periodic visits to at least the major eligible lenders within the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) agrees that its insurance will not be denied any student because of his or her choice of eligible institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) certifies that it is neither an eligible institution, nor has any substantial affiliation with an eligible institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Emergency advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary is authorized to make advances, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Secretary, to a guaranty agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title, in order to ensure that the guaranty agency shall make loans as the lender-of-last-resort; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the Secretary is seeking to terminate the guaranty agency's agreement, or assuming the guaranty agency's functions, in accordance with section 1078(c)(9)(F)(v) of this title, in order to assist the agency in meeting its immediate cash needs, ensure the uninterrupted payment of claims, or ensure that the guaranty agency shall make loans as described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recovery of advances during fiscal years 1988 and 1989</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount and use of recovered funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, advances made by the Secretary under this section shall be repaid in accordance with this subsection and shall be deposited in the fund established by section 1081 of this title. The Secretary shall, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (2), recover (and so deposit) an amount equal to $75,000,000 during fiscal year 1988 and an amount equal to $35,000,000 for fiscal year 1989.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of guaranty agency obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of advances which shall be repaid by a guaranty agency under paragraph (1), the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall consider the solvency and maturity of the reserve and insurance funds of the guaranty agency assisted by such advances, as determined by the Comptroller General taking into account the requirements of State law as in effect on October 17, 1986;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall not seek repayment of such advances from any State described in subsection (c)(5)(B) of this section during any year of its eligibility under such subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall not seek repayment of such advances from any State if such repayment encumbers the reserve fund requirement of State law as in effect on October 17, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Correction for errors under reduction of excess cash reserves</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall pay any guaranty agency the amount of reimbursement of claims under section 1078(c)(1) of this title, filed between September 1, 1988, and December 31, 1989, which were previously withheld or canceled in order to be applied to satisfy such agency's obligation to eliminate excess cash reserves held by such agency, based on the maximum cash reserve (as described in subsection (e) of this section as in effect on September 1, 1988) permitted at the end of 1986, if such maximum cash reserve was miscalculated <!-- PDFPage:303 -->because of erroneous financial information provided by such agency to the Secretary and if (A) such erroneous information is verified by an audited financial statement of the reserve fund, signed by a certified public accountant, and (B) such audited financial statement is provided to the Secretary prior to January 1, 1993.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of reimbursement for claims shall be equal to the amount of reimbursement for claims withheld or canceled in order to be applied to such agency's obligation to eliminate excess cash reserves which exceeds the amount of that which would have been withheld or canceled if the maximum excess cash reserves had been accurately calculated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Refund of cash reserve payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, within 30 days after July 23, 1992, pay the full amount of payments withheld or canceled under paragraph (3) of this subsection to any guaranty agency which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) was required to eliminate excess cash reserves, based on the maximum cash reserve (as described in subsection (e) of this section as in effect on September 1, 1988) permitted at the end of 1986;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) appealed the Secretary's demand that such agency should eliminate such excess cash reserves and received a waiver of a portion of the amount of such excess cash reserves to be eliminated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) had payments under section 1078(c)(1) of this title or section 1078(f) of this title previously withheld or canceled in order to be applied to satisfy such agency's obligation to eliminate excess cash reserves held by such agency, based on the maximum cash reserve (as described in subsection (e) of this section as in effect on September 1, 1988) permitted at the end of 1986; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) according to a Department of Education review that was completed and forwarded to such guaranty agency prior to January 1, 1992, is expected to become insolvent during or before 1996 and the payments withheld or canceled under paragraph (3) of this subsection are a factor in such agency's impending insolvency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Preservation and recovery of guaranty agency reserves</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to recover funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the reserve funds of the guaranty agencies, and any assets purchased with such reserve funds, regardless of who holds or controls the reserves or assets, shall be considered to be the property of the United States to be used in the operation of the program authorized by this part. However, the Secretary may not require the return of all reserve funds of a guaranty agency to the Secretary unless the Secretary determines that such return is in the best interest of the operation of the program authorized by this part, or to ensure the proper maintenance of such agency's funds or assets or the orderly termination of the guaranty agency's operations and the liquidation of its assets. The reserves shall be maintained by each guaranty agency to pay program expenses and contingent liabilities, as authorized by the Secretary, except that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds recalled by the Secretary under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Required share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall require each guaranty agency to return reserve funds under paragraph (1) based on the agency's required share of recalled reserve funds held by guaranty agencies as of September 30, 1996. For purposes of this paragraph, a guaranty agency's required share of recalled reserve funds shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary shall compute each guaranty agency's reserve ratio by dividing (i) the amount held in the agency's reserve funds as of September 30, 1996 (but reflecting later accounting or auditing adjustments approved by the Secretary), by (ii) the original principal amount of all loans for which the agency has an outstanding insurance obligation as of such date, including amounts of outstanding loans transferred to the agency from another guaranty agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the reserve ratio of any guaranty agency as computed under subparagraph (A) exceeds 2.0 percent, the agency's required share shall include so much of the amounts held in the agency's reserve funds as exceed a reserve ratio of 2.0 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If any additional amount is required to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraph (B)), such additional amount shall be obtained by imposing on each guaranty agency an equal percentage reduction in the amount of the agency's reserve funds remaining after deduction of the amount recalled under subparagraph (B), except that such percentage reduction under this subparagraph shall not result in the agency's reserve ratio being reduced below 0.58 percent. The equal percentage reduction shall be the percentage obtained by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the additional amount required to be recalled (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraph (B)), by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total amount of all such agencies&rsquo; reserve funds remaining (after deduction of the required shares calculated under such subparagraph).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If any additional amount is required to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraphs (B) and (C)), such additional amount shall be obtained by imposing on each guaranty agency with a reserve ratio (after deducting the required shares calculated under such subparagraphs) in excess of 0.58 percent an equal percentage reduction in the amount of the agency's reserve funds remaining (after such deduction) that exceed a reserve ratio of 0.58 percent. The equal percentage reduction shall be the percentage obtained by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the additional amount to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the amount recalled under subparagraphs (B) and (C)), by</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Restricted accounts required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 90 days after the beginning of each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, each guaranty agency shall transfer a portion of the agency's required share determined under paragraph (3) to a restricted account established by the agency that is of a type selected by the agency with the approval of the Secretary. Funds transferred to such restricted accounts shall be invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or in other similarly low-risk securities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A guaranty agency shall not use the funds in such a restricted account for any purpose without the express written permission of the Secretary, except that a guaranty agency may use the earnings from such restricted account for default reduction activities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Installments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In each of fiscal years 1998 through 2002, each guaranty agency shall transfer the agency's required share to such restricted account in 5 equal annual installments, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a guaranty agency that has a reserve ratio (as computed under subparagraph (3)(A)) equal to or less than 1.10 percent may transfer the agency's required share to such account in 4 equal installments beginning in fiscal year 1999; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a guaranty agency may transfer such required share to such account in accordance with such other payment schedules as are approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Shortage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on September 1, 2002, the total amount in the restricted accounts described in paragraph (4) is less than the amount the Secretary is required to recall under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall require the return of the amount of the shortage from other reserve funds held by guaranty agencies under procedures established by the Secretary. The Secretary shall first attempt to obtain the amount of such shortage from each guaranty agency that failed to transfer the agency's required share to the agency's restricted account in accordance with paragraph (4).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:305 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines that a guaranty agency has failed to transfer to a restricted account any portion of the agency's required share under this subsection, the agency may not receive any other funds under this part until the Secretary determines that the agency has so transferred the agency's required share.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may waive the requirements of subparagraph (B) for a guaranty agency described in such subparagraph if the Secretary determines that there are extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the agency that justify such waiver.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay lender claims pursuant to sections 1078(b)(1)(G), 1078(j), 1087, and 1087&ndash;2(q) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay into the Agency Operating Fund established pursuant to section 1072b of this title (in this section and section 1072b of this title referred to as the &ldquo;Operating Fund&rdquo;) a default aversion fee in accordance with section 1078(<em>l</em>) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Ownership of Federal Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Fund, and any nonliquid asset (such as a building or equipment) developed or purchased by the guaranty agency in whole or in part with Federal reserve funds, regardless of who holds or controls the Federal reserve funds or such asset, shall be considered to be the property of the United States, prorated based on the percentage of such asset developed or purchased with Federal reserve funds, which property shall be used in the operation of the program authorized by this part, as provided in subsection (d) of this section. The Secretary may restrict or regulate the use of such asset only to the extent necessary to reasonably protect the Secretary's prorated share of the value of such asset. The Secretary may direct a guaranty agency, or such agency's officers or directors, to cease any activity involving expenditures, use, or transfer of the Federal Fund administered by the guaranty agency that the Secretary determines is a misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure of the Federal Fund or the Secretary's share of such asset.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to establish the Operating Fund, each guaranty agency may transfer not more than 180 days&rsquo; cash expenses for normal operating expenses (not including claim payments) as a working capital reserve as defined in Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;87 (Cost Accounting Standards) from the Federal Fund for deposit into the Operating Fund for use in the performance of the guaranty agency's duties under this part. Such transfers may occur during the first 3 years following the establishment of the Operating Fund. However, no agency may transfer in excess of 45 percent of the balance, as of September 30, 1998, of the agency's Federal Fund to the agency's Operating Fund during such 3-year period. In determining the amount that may be transferred, the agency shall ensure that sufficient funds remain in the Federal Fund to pay lender claims within the required time periods and to meet the reserve recall requirements of this section and subsections (h) and (i) of section 1072 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A limited number of guaranty agencies may transfer interest earned on the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund during the first 3 years after October 7, 1998, if the guaranty agency demonstrates to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cash flow in the Operating Fund will be negative without the transfer of such interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transfer of such interest will substantially improve the financial circumstances of the guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Repayment provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall begin repayment of sums transferred pursuant to this subsection not later than the start of the fourth year after the establishment of the Operating Fund, and shall repay all amounts transferred not later than 5 years from the date of the establishment of the Operating Fund. With respect to amounts transferred from the Federal Fund, the guaranty agency shall not be required to repay any interest on the funds transferred and subsequently repaid. The guaranty agency shall provide to the Secretary a reasonable schedule for repayment of the sums transferred and an annual financial analysis demonstrating the agency's ability to comply with the schedule and repay all outstanding sums transferred.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:308 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a guaranty agency transfers funds from the Federal Fund in accordance with this section, and fails to make scheduled repayments to the Federal Fund, the agency may not receive any other funds under this part until the Secretary determines that the agency has made such repayments. The Secretary shall pay to the guaranty agency any funds withheld in accordance with this paragraph immediately upon making the determination that the guaranty agency has made all such repayments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) waive the requirements of paragraph (3), but only with respect to repayment of interest that was transferred in accordance with paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) waive paragraph (4);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">for a guaranty agency, if the Secretary determines that there are extenuating circumstances (such as State constitutional prohibitions) beyond the control of the agency that justify such a waiver.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Extension of repayment period for interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Extension permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall extend the period for repayment of interest that was transferred in accordance with paragraph (2) from 2 years to 5 years if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the cash flow of the Operating Fund will be negative as a result of repayment as required by paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the repayment of the interest transferred will substantially diminish the financial circumstances of the guaranty agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the guaranty agency has demonstrated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) that the agency is able to repay all transferred funds by the end of the 8th year following the date of establishment of the Operating Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that the agency will be financially sound on the completion of repayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repayment of income on transferred funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All repayments made to the Federal Fund during the 6th, 7th, and 8th years following the establishment of the Operating Fund of interest that was transferred shall include the sums transferred plus any income earned from the investment of the sums transferred after the 5th year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Investment of Federal funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds transferred from the Federal Fund to the Operating Fund for operating expenses shall be invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or a State, or in other similarly low-risk securities selected by the guaranty agency, with the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In calculating the minimum reserve level required by section 1078(c)(9)(A) of this title, the Secretary shall include all amounts owed to the Federal Fund by the guaranty agency in the calculation.</p>

Whenever the determination required by the preceding sentence cannot be made because the agency or lender does not have 3 years previous experience, the amount such agency or lender is eligible to receive may not exceed 25 percent of the loans guaranteed under a program of a State of comparable size.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Each guaranty agency and each eligible lender in a State described in section 1085(d)(1)(D) or (F) of this title shall repay advances made under section 1087&ndash;2(p) of this title in accordance with agreements entered into between the Association and such agency or lender.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Multiple disbursement of loans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Escrow accounts administered by escrow agent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any guaranty agency or eligible lender (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;escrow agent&rdquo;) may enter into an agreement with any other eligible lender that is not an eligible institution or an agency or instrumentality of the State (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;lender&rdquo;) for the purpose of authorizing disbursements of the proceeds of a loan to a student. Such agreement shall provide that the lender will pay the proceeds of such loans into an escrow account to be administered by the escrow agent in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such agreement may allow the lender to make payments into the escrow account in amounts that do not exceed the sum of the amounts required for disbursement of initial or subsequent installments to borrowers and to make such payments not more than 21 days prior to the date of the disbursement of such installment to such borrowers. Such agreement shall require the lender to notify promptly the eligible institution when funds are escrowed under this subsection for a student at such institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority of escrow agent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each escrow agent entering into an agreement under paragraph (1) of this subsection is authorized to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Lenders-of-last-resort</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In each State, the guaranty agency or an eligible lender in the State described in section 1085(d)(1)(D) of this title shall make loans directly, or through an agreement with an eligible lender or lenders, to students eligible to receive interest benefits paid on their behalf under subsection (a) of this section who are otherwise unable to obtain loans under this part. Loans made under this subsection shall <!-- PDFPage:335 -->not exceed the amount of the need of the borrower, as determined under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, nor be less than $200. The guaranty agency shall consider the request of any eligible lender, as defined under section 1085(d)(1)(A) of this title, to serve as the lender-of-last-resort pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rules and operating procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The guaranty agency shall develop rules and operating procedures for the lender-of-last-resort program designed to ensure that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consistent with standards established by the Secretary, students applying for loans under this subsection shall not be subject to additional eligibility requirements or requests for additional information beyond what is required under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 in order to receive a loan under this part from an eligible lender, nor be required to receive more than two rejections from eligible lenders in order to obtain a loan under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) information about the availability of loans under the program is made available to institutions of higher education in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) appropriate steps are taken to ensure that borrowers receiving loans under the program are appropriately counseled on their loan obligation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the guaranty agency notifies the Secretary when the guaranty agency believes or has reason to believe that the Secretary may need to exercise the Secretary's authority under section 1087&ndash;2(q) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Advances to guaranty agencies for lender-of-last-resort services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In order to ensure the availability of loan capital, the Secretary is authorized to provide a guaranty agency designated for a State with additional advance funds in accordance with subparagraph (C) and section 1072(c)(7) of this title, with such restrictions on the use of such funds as are determined appropriate by the Secretary, in order to ensure that the guaranty agency will make loans as the lender-of-last-resort. Such agency shall make such loans in accordance with this subsection and the requirements of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, a guaranty agency serving as a lender-of-last-resort under this paragraph shall be paid a fee, established by the Secretary, for making such loans in lieu of interest and special allowance subsidies, and shall be required to assign such loans to the Secretary on demand. Upon such assignment, the portion of the advance represented by the loans assigned shall be considered repaid by such guaranty agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary shall exercise the authority described in subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary determines that eligible borrowers are seeking and are unable to obtain loans under this part, and that the guaranty agency designated for that State has the capability to provide lender-of-last-resort loans in a timely manner, in accordance with the guaranty agency's obligations under paragraph (1), but cannot do so without advances provided by the Secretary under this paragraph. If the Secretary makes the determinations described in the preceding sentence and determines that it would be cost-effective to do so, the Secretary may provide advances under this paragraph to such guaranty agency. If the Secretary determines that such guaranty agency does not have such capability, or will not provide such loans in a timely fashion, the Secretary may provide such advances to enable another guaranty agency, that the Secretary determines to have such capability, to make lender-of-last-resort loans to eligible borrowers in that State who are experiencing loan access problems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Information on defaults</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Provision of information to eligible institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in order to notify eligible institutions of former students who are in default of their continuing obligation to repay student loans, each guaranty agency shall, upon the request of an eligible institution, furnish information with respect to students who were enrolled at the eligible institution and who are in default on the repayment of any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part. The information authorized to be furnished under this subsection shall include the names and addresses of such students.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reimbursement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A guaranty agency, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, may transfer from the Federal Student Loan Reserve Fund under section 1072a of this title to the Agency Operating Fund under section 1072b of this title a default aversion fee. Such fee shall be paid for any loan on which a claim <!-- PDFPage:336 -->for default has not been paid as a result of the loan being brought into current repayment status by the guaranty agency on or before the 300th day after the loan becomes 60 days delinquent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The default aversion fee shall be equal to 1 percent of the total unpaid principal and accrued interest on the loan at the time the request is submitted by the lender.

Such a fee shall not be paid more than once on any loan for which the guaranty agency averts the default unless&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Loans for which income contingent repayment may be required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan made under this part may be required to be repaid under this subsection if the note or other evidence of the loan has been assigned to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c)(8) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Blanket certificate of loan guaranty</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) offer eligible lenders participating in the agency's guaranty program a blanket certificate of loan guaranty that permits the lender to make loans without receiving prior approval from the guaranty agency of individual loans for eligible borrowers enrolled in eligible programs at eligible institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide eligible lenders with the ability to transmit electronically data to the agency concerning loans the lender has elected to make under the agency's insurance program via standard reporting formats, with such reporting to occur at reasonable and standard intervals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations on blanket certificate of guaranty</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Other repayment incentives</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sale of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each guaranty agency shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary which shall provide that upon securing consecutive payments for 12 months of amounts owed on a loan for which the Secretary has made a payment under paragraph (1) of section 1078(c) of this title, the guaranty agency (pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary) or the Secretary shall, if practicable, sell the loan to an eligible lender. Such loan shall not be sold to an eligible lender who has been found by the guaranty agency or the Secretary to have substantially failed to exercise the due diligence required of lenders under this part. Neither the guaranty agency nor the Secretary shall demand from a borrower as monthly payment amounts referred to in this paragraph more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An agreement between the guaranty agency and the Secretary for purposes of this paragraph shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the repayment by the agency to the Secretary of 81.5 percent of the amount of the principal balance outstanding at the time of such sale, multiplied by the reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the guaranty agreement was made with respect to the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for the reinstatement by the Secretary (I) of the obligation to reimburse such agen<!-- PDFPage:358 -->cy for the amount expended by it in discharge of its insurance obligation under its loan insurance program, and (II) of the obligation to pay to the holder of such loan a special allowance pursuant to section 1087&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A loan which does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) may also be eligible for sale under this paragraph upon a determination that the loan was in default due to clerical or data processing error and would not, in the absence of such error, be in a delinquent status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of proceeds of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts received by the Secretary pursuant to the sale of such loans by a guaranty agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be deducted from the calculations of the amount of reimbursement for which the agency is eligible under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection for the fiscal year in which the amount was received, notwithstanding the fact that the default occurred in a prior fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Borrower eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any borrower whose loan is sold under paragraph (1) shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional loans or grants under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 (for which he or she is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such loan sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability of general loan conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan which is sold under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, so long as the borrower continues to make scheduled repayments thereon, be subject to the same terms and conditions and qualify for the same benefits and privileges as other loans made under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Satisfactory repayment arrangements to renew eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each guaranty agency shall establish a program which allows a borrower with a defaulted loan or loans to renew eligibility for all title IV student financial assistance (regardless of whether the defaulted loan has been sold to an eligible lender) upon the borrower's payment of 6 consecutive monthly payments. The guaranty agency shall not demand from a borrower as a monthly payment amount under this subsection more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. A borrower may only obtain the benefit of this subsection with respect to renewed eligibility once.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disbursement and endorsement requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) First year students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The first installment of the proceeds of any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part that is made to a student borrower who is entering the first year of a program of undergraduate education, and who has not previously obtained a loan under this part, shall not (regardless of the amount of such loan or the duration of the period of enrollment) be presented by the institution to the student for endorsement until 30 days after the borrower begins a course of study, but may be delivered to the eligible institution prior to the end of that 30-day period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Withholding of second disbursement</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Students receiving over-awards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sum of a disbursement for any student and the other financial aid obtained by such student exceeds the amount of assistance for which the student is eligible under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, the institution such student is attending shall withhold and return to the lender or escrow agent the portion (or all) of such installment that exceeds such eligible amount, except that overawards permitted pursuant to section 2753(b)(4) of title 42 shall not be construed to be overawards for purposes of this paragraph.

<p class="statutory-body">An eligible lender shall not sell or transfer a promissory note for any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part until the final disbursement of such loan has been made, except that the prohibition of this subsection shall not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sale of the loan does not result in a change in the identity of the party to whom payments will be made for the loan; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of amount of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) of <!-- PDFPage:361 -->this section shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loan limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the annual and aggregate limits for loans under this section shall be the same as those established under section 1078(b)(1) of this title, less any amount received by such student pursuant to the subsidized loan program established under section 1078 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except in cases where the Secretary determines,<sup><a href="#1078-8_1_target" name="1078-8_1">1</a></sup> that a higher amount is warranted in order to carry out the purpose of this part with respect to students engaged in specialized training requiring exceptionally high costs of education, but the annual insurable limit per student shall not be deemed to be exceeded by a line of credit under which actual payments by the lender to the borrower will not be made in any years in excess of the annual limit.</p>

At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Repayment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of calculating the repayment period under section 1078(b)(9) of this title, such period shall commence at the time the first payment of principal is due from the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Qualification for forbearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A lender may grant the borrower of a loan under this section a forbearance for a period not to exceed 60 days if the lender reasonably determines that such a forbearance from collection activity is warranted following a borrower's request for forbearance, deferment, or a change in repayment plan, or a request to consolidate loans in order to collect or process appropriate supporting documentation related to the request. During any such period, interest on the loan shall accrue but not be capitalized.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary determines that an eligible lender, servicer, or guaranty agency has a compliance performance rating that equals or exceeds 97 percent, the Secretary shall designate the eligible lender, servicer, or <!-- PDFPage:364 -->guaranty agency, as the case may be, for exceptional performance. The Secretary shall notify each appropriate guaranty agency of the eligible lenders and servicers designated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance performance rating</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a compliance performance rating is determined with respect to compliance with due diligence in the collection of loans under this part for each year for which the determination is made. Such rating is equal to the percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary by regulation, with respect to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) 100 percent payment rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay each eligible lender or servicer (as agent for an eligible lender) designated under subsection (a) of this section 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest of all loans for which claims are submitted for payment by that eligible lender or servicer for the one-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under this section or until the guaranty agency receives notice from the Secretary that the designation of the lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section has been revoked.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall revoke the designation of a lender or servicer under subsection (a) of this section if any quarterly audit required under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not received by the Secretary by the date established by the Secretary or if the audit indicates the lender or servicer failed to maintain 97 percent or higher compliance with program regulations, as reflected in the performance of not less than 97 percent of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary for the purpose of this section, for 2 consecutive months or 90 percent for 1 month.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit the authority of guaranty agencies to require the submission of claims documentation evidencing servicing performed on loans, except that the guaranty agency may not require greater documentation than that required for lenders and servicers not designated under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payments to guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall pay to each guaranty agency designated under subsection (a) of this section the appropriate percentage under this subsection for the 1-year period following the receipt by the guaranty agency of the notification of designation under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

The standards shall measure the lender's or servicer's compliance with the due diligence standards and shall include a defined statistical sampling technique designed to measure the performance rating of the eligible lender or servicer for the purpose of this section. Each eligible lender or servicer shall submit the audit required by this section to the Secretary and to each appropriate guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional information on lenders and servicers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each appropriate guaranty agency shall provide the Secretary with such other information in its possession regarding an eligible lender or servicer desiring designation as may relate to the Secretary's determination under subsection (a) of this section, including but not limited to any information suggesting that the application of a lender or servicer for designation under subsection (a) of this section should not be approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section, such other information as provided by any guaranty agency under paragraph (2), and any information in the possession of the Secretary or submitted by any other agency or office of the Federal Government.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cost of audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible lender or servicer shall pay for all the costs of the audits required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Compliance audit</h4>

The compliance audit will review compliance with due diligence requirements for the period since the last audit.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:365 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Loss of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the audit performed pursuant to paragraph (5) fails to meet the standards for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the lender or servicer shall lose its designation as an exceptional lender or servicer. A lender or servicer receiving a compliance audit not meeting the standard for designation as an exceptional lender or servicer may reapply for designation under subsection (a) of this section at any time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Due diligence standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Due diligence standards used for determining compliance under paragraph (5) shall be promulgated by the Secretary after consultation with lenders, guaranty agencies and servicers and shall consist of a list of specific elements for the Federal regulations selected to provide an indication of systems degradation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Additional revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, designation under subsection (a) of this section may be revoked at any time by the Secretary if the Secretary determines that the eligible lender or servicer has failed to maintain an overall level of regulatory compliance consistent with the audit submitted by the eligible lender or servicer under this section or if the Secretary believes the lender or servicer may have engaged in fraud in securing designation under subsection (a) of this section or is failing to service loans in accordance with program regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of designated guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Audit of guaranty agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency desiring a designation under subsection (a) of this section shall have a financial and compliance audit of the defaulted loan portfolio of such guaranty agency conducted annually by a qualified independent organization or person from a list of qualified organizations or persons promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General and the Secretary. The standards shall include defined statistical sampling techniques designed to measure the performance rating of the guaranty agency for the purpose of this section. Each guaranty agency shall submit the audit required by this paragraph to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quarterly sample audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may require quarterly sample audits as a means of determining continued qualification of the guaranty agency for designation as an exceptional guaranty agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subsection (a) of this section based upon the audits submitted under this section and other information in his possession. If the results of the audit are not persuasively rebutted by such other information, the Secretary shall inform the guaranty agency that its application for designation as an exceptional guaranty agency has been approved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each guaranty agency shall pay for all of the costs of the audits regulated by this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation for fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may revoke the designation of a guaranty agency under subsection (a) of this section at any time if the Secretary has reason to believe the guaranty agency secured its designation under subsection (a) of this section through fraud or fails to comply with applicable regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Revocation based on performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Designation as an exceptional guaranty agency may be revoked at any time by the Secretary upon 30 days notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary upon a finding by the Secretary that the guaranty agency has failed to maintain an acceptable overall level of regulatory compliance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursements made by the Secretary on loans submitted for claim by an eligible lender or loan servicer designated for exceptional performance under this section shall not be subject to additional review by the Secretary or repurchase by the guaranty agency for any reason other than a determination by the Secretary that the eligible lender, loan servicer, or guaranty agency engaged in fraud or other purposeful misconduct in obtaining designation for exceptional performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the processing of claims on student loans of eligible lenders not subject to this paragraph.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loan-by-loan insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to issue certificates on application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, upon application by an eligible lender, made upon such form, containing such information, and supported by such evidence as the Secretary may require, and otherwise in conformity with this section, the Secretary finds that the applicant has made a loan to an eligible student which is insurable under the provisions of this part, he may issue to the applicant a certificate of insurance covering the loan and setting forth the amount and terms of the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effectiveness of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall become effective upon the date of issuance of the certificate, except that the Secretary is authorized, in accordance with regulations, to issue commitments with respect to proposed loans, or with respect to lines (or proposed lines) of credit, submitted by eligible lenders, and in that event, upon compliance with subsection (a)(1) of this section by the lender, the certificate of insurance may be issued effective as of the date when any loan, or any payment by the lender pursuant to a line of credit, to be covered by such insurance was made. Such insurance shall cease to be effective upon 60 days&rsquo; default by the lender in the payment of any installment of the premiums payable pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contents of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An application submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall contain (A) an agreement by the applicant to pay, in accordance with regulations, the premiums fixed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and (B) an agreement by the applicant that if the loan is covered by insurance the applicant will submit such supplementary reports and statement during the effective period of the loan agreement, upon such forms, at such times, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe by or pursuant to regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Comprehensive insurance coverage certificate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of system by regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of requiring a separate insurance application and issuing a separate certificate of insurance for each student loan made by an eligible lender as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations consistent with section 1074 of this title, issue to any eligible lender applying therefor a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage which shall, without further action by the Secretary, insure all insurable loans made by that lender, on or after the date of the certificate and before a specified cutoff date, within the limits of an aggregate maximum amount stated in the certificate. Such <!-- PDFPage:370 -->regulations may provide for conditioning such insurance, with respect to any loan, upon compliance by the lender with such requirements (to be stated or incorporated by reference in the certificate) as in the Secretary's judgment will best achieve the purpose of this subsection while protecting the United States from the risk of unreasonable loss and promoting the objectives of this part, including (but not limited to) provisions as to the reporting of such loans and information relevant thereto to the Secretary and as to the payment of initial and other premiums and the effect of default therein, and including provision for confirmation by the Secretary from time to time (through endorsement of the certificate) of the coverage of specific new loans by such certificate, which confirmation shall be incontestable by the Secretary in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation of fact or patent error.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uncovered loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the holder of a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage issued under this subsection grants to a student a line of credit extending beyond the cutoff date specified in that certificate, loans or payments thereon made by the holder after that date pursuant to the line of credit shall not be deemed to be included in the coverage of that certificate except as may be specifically provided therein; but, subject to the limitations of section 1074 of this title, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations, make commitments to insure such future loans or payments, and such commitments may be honored either as provided in subsection (a) of this section or by inclusion of such insurance on comprehensive coverage under the subsection for the period or periods in which such future loans or payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Charges for Federal insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, pursuant to regulations, charge for insurance on each loan under this part a premium in an amount not to exceed one-fourth of 1 percent per year of the unpaid principal amount of such loan (excluding interest added to principal), payable in advance, at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations may provide that such premium shall not be payable, or if paid shall be refundable, with respect to any period after default in the payment of principal or interest or after the borrower has died or becomes totally and permanently disabled, if (1) notice of such default or other event has been duly given, and (2) requests for payment of the loss insured against has been made or the Secretary has made such payment on his own motion pursuant to section 1080(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignability of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rights of an eligible lender arising under insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance issued to it under this section may be assigned as security by such lender only to another eligible lender, and subject to regulation by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consolidation not to affect insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The consolidation of the obligations of two or more federally insured loans obtained by a student borrower in any fiscal year into a single obligation evidenced by a single instrument of indebtedness shall not affect the insurance by the United States. If the loans thus consolidated are covered by separate certificates of insurance issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may upon surrender of the original certificates issue a new certificate of insurance in accordance with that subsection upon the consolidated obligation; if they are covered by a single comprehensive certificate issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may amend that certificate accordingly.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1080. Default of student under Federal loan insurance program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to Secretary and payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon default by the student borrower on any loan covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant to this part, and prior to the commencement of suit or other enforcement proceedings upon security for that loan, the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the Secretary, and the Secretary shall if requested (at that time or after further collection efforts) by the beneficiary, or may on the Secretary's own motion, if the insurance is still in effect, pay to the beneficiary the amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan as soon as that amount has been determined. The &ldquo;amount of the loss&rdquo; on any loan shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the principal amount and accrued interest, including interest accruing from the date of submission of a valid default claim (as determined by the Secretary) to the date on which payment is authorized by the Secretary, reduced to the extent required by section 1075(b) of this title. Such beneficiary shall be required to meet the standards of due diligence in the collection of the loan and shall be required to submit proof that the institution was contacted and other reasonable attempts were made to locate the borrower (when the location of the borrower is unknown) and proof that contact was made with the borrower (when the location is known). The Secretary shall make the determination required to carry out the provisions of this section not later than 90 days after the notification by the insurance beneficiary and shall make payment in full on the amount of the beneficiary's loss pending completion of the due diligence investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of payment of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon payment of the amount of the loss pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the <!-- PDFPage:371 -->United States shall be subrogated for all of the rights of the holder of the obligation upon the insured loan and shall be entitled to an assignment of the note or other evidence of the insured loan by the insurance beneficiary. If the net recovery made by the Secretary on a loan after deduction of the cost of that recovery (including reasonable administrative costs and collection costs, to the extent set forth in regulations issued by the Secretary) exceeds the amount of the loss, the excess shall be paid over to the insured. The Secretary may, in attempting to make recovery on such loans, contract with private business concerns, State student loan insurance agencies, or State guaranty agencies, for payment for services rendered by such concerns or agencies in assisting the Secretary in making such recovery. Any contract under this subsection entered into by the Secretary shall provide that attempts to make recovery on such loans shall be fair and reasonable, and do not involve harassment, intimidation, false or misleading representations, or unnecessary communications concerning the existence of any such loan to persons other than the student borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forbearance not precluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the student borrower which may be agreed upon by the parties to the insured loan and approved by the Secretary, or to preclude forbearance by the Secretary in the enforcement of the insured obligation after payment on that insurance. Any forbearance which is approved by the Secretary under this subsection with respect to the repayment of a loan, including a forbearance during default, shall not be considered as indicating that a holder of a federally insured loan has failed to exercise reasonable care and due diligence in the collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Care and diligence required of holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to excuse the holder of a federally insured loan from exercising reasonable care and diligence in the making and collection of loans under the provisions of this part. If the Secretary, after a reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to an eligible lender, finds that it has substantially failed to exercise such care and diligence or to make the reports and statements required under section 1078(a)(4) of this title and section 1079(a)(3) of this title, or to pay the required Federal loan insurance premiums, the Secretary shall disqualify that lender for further Federal insurance on loans granted pursuant to this part until the Secretary is satisfied that its failure has ceased and finds that there is reasonable assurance that the lender will in the future exercise necessary care and diligence or comply with such requirements, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Default rate of lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall annually publish a list indicating the cohort default rate (determined in accordance with section 1085(m) of this title) for each originating lender, subsequent holder, and guaranty agency participating in the program assisted under this part and an average cohort default rate for all institutions of higher education within each State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a cohort default rate through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control, or any similar device.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rate establishment and correction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a cohort default rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies (determined consistent with section 1085(m) of this title), except that the rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies shall not reflect any loans issued in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title. The Secretary shall allow institutions, lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies the opportunity to correct such cohort default rate information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established a student loan insurance fund (hereinafter in this section called the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;) which shall be available without fiscal year limitation to the Secretary for making payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with payments under a guaranty agreement under section 1078(c) of this title. All amounts received by the Secretary as premium charges for insurance and as receipts, earnings, or proceeds derived from any claim or other assets acquired by the Secretary in connection with operations under this part, any excess advances under section 1072 of this title, and any other moneys, property, or assets derived by the Secretary from operations in connection with this section, shall be deposited in the fund. All payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this part, or in connection with such guaranty agreements shall be paid from the fund. Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations under this section may be invested in bonds or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States.</p>

Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes and other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter, are extended to include any purchase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired under this subsection.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Required disclosure before disbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each eligible lender, at or prior to the time such lender disburses a loan that is insured or guaranteed under this part (other than a loan made under section 1078&ndash;3 of this title), shall provide thorough and accurate loan information on such loan to the borrower in simple and understandable terms. Any disclosure required by this subsection may be made by an eligible lender by written or electronic means, including as part of the application material provided to the borrower, as part of the promissory note evidencing the loan, or on a separate written form provided to the borrower. Each lender shall provide to each borrower a telephone number, and may provide an electronic address, through which additional loan information can be obtained. The disclosure shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a statement prominently and clearly displayed and in bold print that the borrower is receiving a loan that must be repaid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the name of the eligible lender, and the address to which communications and payments should be sent;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the amount of any charges, such as the origination fee and insurance premium, collected by the lender at or prior to the disbursal of the loan and whether such charges are deducted from the proceeds of the loan or paid separately by the borrower;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) a statement that the borrower has the right to prepay all or part of the loan, at any time, without penalty, a statement summarizing circumstances in which repayment of the loan or interest that accrues on the loan may be deferred, and a brief notice of the program for repayment of loans, on the basis of military service, pursuant to section 902 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981 (10 U.S.C. 2141, note);&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1083_1_target" name="1083_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) a definition of default and the consequences to the borrower if the borrower defaults, including a statement that the default will be reported to a credit bureau or credit reporting agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) an explanation of any cost the borrower may incur in the making or collection of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required disclosure before repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each eligible lender shall, at or prior to the start of the repayment period of the student borrower on loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, disclose to the borrower by written or electronic means the information required under this subsection in simple and understandable terms. Each eligible lender shall provide to each borrower a telephone number, and may provide an electronic address, through which additional loan information can be obtained. For any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, other than a loan made under section 1078&ndash;2 or 1078&ndash;3 of this title, such disclosure required by this subsection shall be made not less than 30 days nor more than 240 days before the first payment on the loan is due from the borrower.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cost of disclosure and consequences of nondisclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such information shall be available without cost to the borrower. The failure of an eligible lender to provide information as required by this section shall not (1) relieve a borrower of the obligation to repay a loan in accordance with its terms, (2) provide a basis for a claim for civil damages, or (3) be deemed to abrogate the obligation of the Secretary under a contract of insurance or reinsurance, or the obligation of a guaranty agency under a contract of guaranty. Nothing in this section shall be construed as subjecting the lender to the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] with regard to loans made under this part.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this part:</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligible institution</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;eligible institution&rdquo; means an institution of higher education, as defined in section 1002 of this title, except that, for the purposes of sections 1077(a)(2)(C)(i) and 1078(b)(1)(M)(i) of this title, an eligible institution includes any institution that is within this definition without regard to whether such institution is participating in any program under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and includes any institution ineligible for participation in any program under this part pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Ineligibility based on high default rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An institution whose cohort default rate is equal to or greater than the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available shall not be eligible to participate in a program under this part for the fiscal year for which the determination is made and for the two succeeding fiscal years, unless, within 30 days of receiving notification from the Secretary of the loss of eligibility under this paragraph, the institution appeals the loss of its eligibility to the Secretary. The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal within 45 days after its submission. Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the Secretary's calculation of its cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce its cohort default rate for any of the three fiscal years below the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) there are exceptional mitigating circumstances within the meaning of paragraph (4); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, other exceptional mitigating circumstances that would make the application of this paragraph inequitable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">During such appeal, the Secretary may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part. If an institution continues to participate in a program under this part, and the institution's appeal of the loss of eligibility is unsuccessful, the institution shall be required to pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount of interest, special allowance, reinsurance, and any related payments made by the Secretary (or which the Secretary is obligated to make) with respect to loans made under this part to students attending, or planning to attend, that institution during the pendency of such appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of determinations under subparagraph (A), the threshold percentage is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 35 percent for fiscal year 1991 and 1992;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) 25 percent for any succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Until July 1, 1999, this paragraph shall not apply to any institution that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a part B institution within the meaning of section 1061(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a tribally controlled community college within the meaning of section 1801(a)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1085_1_target" name="1085_1">1</a></sup> of title 25; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) a Navajo Community College under the Navajo Community College Act [25 U.S.C. 640a et seq.].</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding the first sentence of subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall restore the eligibility to participate in a program under subpart 1 of part A, part B, or part D of this subchapter of an institution that did not appeal its loss of eligibility within 30 days of receiving notification if the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the institution's failure to appeal was substantially justified under the circumstances, and that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the institution made a timely request that the appropriate guaranty agency correct errors in the draft data used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the guaranty agency did not correct the erroneous data in a timely fashion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the institution would have been eligible if the erroneous data had been corrected by the guaranty agency.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:385 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appeals based upon allegations of improper loan servicing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An institution that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Family Education Loan Program pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students pursuant to section 1078&ndash;1(a)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1085_1_target" name="1085_1">1</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is an institution whose cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent for the most recent year for which data are available;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">may include in its appeal of such loss or rate a defense based on improper loan servicing (in addition to other defenses). In any such appeal, the Secretary shall take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that such institution has access for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days, to a representative sample (as determined by the Secretary) of the relevant loan servicing and collection records used by a guaranty agency in determining whether to pay a claim on a defaulted loan or by the Department in determining an institution's default rate in the loan program under part C of this subchapter. The Secretary shall reduce the institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans in the representative sample that are required to be excluded pursuant to subsection (m)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Definition of mitigating circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), an institution of higher education shall be treated as having exceptional mitigating circumstances that make application of that paragraph inequitable if such institution, in the opinion of an independent auditor, meets the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For a 12-month period that ended during the 6 months immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the cohort of borrowers used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate is determined, at least two-thirds of the students enrolled on at least a half-time basis at the institution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) are eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant award that is at least equal to one-half the maximum Federal Pell Grant award for which a student would be eligible based on the student's enrollment status; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) have an adjusted gross income that when added with the adjusted gross income of the student's parents (unless the student is an independent student), of less than the poverty level, as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In the case of an institution of higher education that offers an associate, baccalaureate, graduate or professional degree, 70 percent or more of the institution's regular students who were initially enrolled on a full-time basis and were scheduled to complete their programs during the same 12-month period described in clause (i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) completed the educational programs in which the students were enrolled;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) transferred from the institution to a higher level educational program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) at the end of the 12-month period, remained enrolled and making satisfactory progress toward completion of the student's educational programs; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) entered active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii)(I) In the case of an institution of higher education that does not award a degree described in clause (ii), had a placement rate of 44 percent or more with respect to the institution's former regular students who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(aa) remained in the program beyond the point the students would have received a 100 percent tuition refund from the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(bb) were initially enrolled on at least a half-time basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(cc) were originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete their educational programs during the same 12-month period described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The placement rate shall not include students who are still enrolled and making satisfactory progress in the educational programs in which the students were originally enrolled on the date following 12 months after the date of the student's last date of attendance at the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) The placement rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all those former regular students who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(aa) are employed, in an occupation for which the institution provided training, on the date following 12 months after the date of their last day of attendance at the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(bb) were employed, in an occupation for which the institution provided training, for at least 13 weeks before the date following 12 months after the date of their last day of attendance at the institution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(cc) entered active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) The placement rate shall not include as placements a student or former student for whom the institution is the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of determining a rate of completion and a placement rate under this paragraph, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount of time normally required to complete the program. The amount of time normally required to complete the program for a student who is initially enrolled full-time is the period of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a full-time student. For a student who is initially enrolled less than full-time, the period is the amount of time it would take the student to complete the program if the student remained enrolled at that level of enrollment throughout the program.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:386 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reduction of default rates at certain minority institutions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Beneficiaries of exception required to establish management plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After July 1, 1999, any institution that has a cohort default rate that equals or exceeds 25 percent for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available and that relies on the exception in subparagraph (B) to continue to be an eligible institution shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) submit to the Secretary a default management plan which the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, after consideration of the institution's history, resources, dollars in default, and targets for default reduction, determines is acceptable and provides reasonable assurance that the institution will, by July 1, 2004, have a cohort default rate that is less than 25 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) engage an independent third party (which may be paid with funds received under section 1059d of this title or part B of subchapter III of this chapter) to provide technical assistance in implementing such default management plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) provide to the Secretary, on an annual basis or at such other intervals as the Secretary may require, evidence of cohort default rate improvement and successful implementation of such default management plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Discretionary eligibility conditioned on improvement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the expiration of the exception in paragraph (2)(C), the Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, continue to treat an institution described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph as an eligible institution for each of the 1-year periods beginning on July 1 of 1999 through 2003, only if the institution submits by the beginning of such period evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such institution has made substantial improvement, during each of the preceding 1-year periods, in the institution's cohort default rate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Participation rate index</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">An institution that demonstrates to the Secretary that the institution's participation rate index is equal to or less than 0.0375 for any of the 3 most recent fiscal years for which data is available shall not be subject to paragraph (2). The participation rate index shall be determined by multiplying the institution's cohort default rate for loans under this part or part C of this subchapter, or weighted average cohort default rate for loans under this part and part C of this subchapter, by the percentage of the institution's regular students, enrolled on at least a half-time basis, who received a loan made under this part or part C of this subchapter for a 12-month period ending during the 6 months immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the cohort of borrowers used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate is determined.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An institution shall provide the Secretary with sufficient data to determine the institution's participation rate index within 30 days after receiving an initial notification of the institution's draft cohort default rate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1087&ndash;1. Special allowances</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of special allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), and (I) and paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans shall be computed (i) by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such 3-month period, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rate on such loans from such average, (iii) by adding 3.10 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to section 1077a(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations, the income from which is exempt from taxation under title 26 shall be one-half the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), except that, in determining the rate for the purpose of this division, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interests or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds. This subparagraph shall not apply to loans which were made or insured prior to October 1, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The quarterly rate of the special allowance set under division (i) of this subparagraph shall not be less than 9.5 percent minus the applicable interest rate on such loans, divided by 4.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) No special allowance may be paid under this subparagraph unless the issuer of such obligations complies with subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which are financed with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations originally issued on or after October 1, 1993, the income from which is excluded from gross income under title 26, shall be the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (I) as the case may be. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interest or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) In the case of loans made before October 1, 1992, pursuant to section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> or 1078&ndash;2 of this title for which the interest rate is determined under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title, a special allowance shall not be paid unless the rate determined for any 12-month period under subparagraph (B) of such section exceeds 12 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Subject to subparagraphs (G), (H), and (I) in the case of loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1992, pursuant to section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> or 1078&ndash;2 of this title for which the interest rate is determined under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title, a special allowance shall not be paid unless the rate determined for any 12-month period under section 1077a(c)(4)(B) of this title exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) 11 percent in the case of a loan under section 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1087-1_1_target" name="1087-1_1">1</a></sup> of this title; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) In the case of loans made or purchased directly from funds loaned or advanced pursuant to a qualified State obligation, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3.5 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.10 percent&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Subject to paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans for which the applicable rate of interest is determined under section 1077a(h) of this title shall be computed (i) by determining the applicable bond equivalent rate of the security with a comparable maturity, as established by the Secretary, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rates on such loans from such applicable bond equivalent rate, (iii) by adding 1.0 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this part in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(C) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with such institution, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in default for the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student (and his or her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to the school for attendance at which the student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year.</p>

Such revised table shall be developed by increasing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table in each such section by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 1992 and the December next preceding the beginning of such academic year, and rounding the result to the nearest $10.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1087tt. Discretion of student financial aid administrators</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances. However, this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special circumstances may include tuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school, medical or dental expenses not covered by insurance, unusually high child care costs, recent unemployment of a family member, the number of parents enrolled at least half-time in a degree, certificate, or other program leading to a recognized educational credential at an institution with a program participation agreement under section 1094 of this title, or other changes in a family's income, a family's assets, or a student's status. Special circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student financial aid administrator in such cases to request and use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting, processing, or delivering such supplementary information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to assets taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in accordance with subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy or an involuntary liquidation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the administrator makes adjustments in the award level of a student with a disability so as to take into consideration the additional costs such student incurs as a result of such student's disability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Refusal or adjustment of loan certifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On a case-by-case basis, an eligible institution may refuse to certify a statement that permits a student to receive a loan under part B or C of this subchapter, or may certify a loan amount or make a loan that is less than the student's determination of need (as determined under this part), if the reason for the action is documented and provided in written form to the student. No eligible institution shall discriminate against any borrower or applicant in obtaining a loan on the basis of race, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, age, or disability status.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:505 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lender eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such lender may offer a combined payment plan only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the lender holds an outstanding loan of that borrower which is selected by the borrower for incorporation into a combined payment plan pursuant to this section (including loans which are selected by the borrower for consolidation under this section); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower certifies that the borrower has sought and has been unable to obtain a combined payment plan from the holders of the outstanding loans of that borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Borrower selection of competing offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of multiple offers by lenders to administer a combined payment plan for a borrower, the borrower shall select from among them the lender to administer the combined payment plan including its loan consolidation component.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the loan being reissued was not in default (as defined in section 733(e)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act) at the time the request for a combined payment plan is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notes and insurance certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each loan reissued under subsection (e) of this section shall be evidenced by a note executed by the borrower.

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 729(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act, the reissued loan shall be made in an amount, including outstanding principal, capitalized interest, accrued unpaid interest not yet capitalized, and authorized late charges. The proceeds of each such loan will be paid by the lender to the holder of the original loan being reissued and the borrower's obligation to that holder on that loan shall be discharged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise specifically provided for under the provisions of this section, the terms of any reissued loan shall be the same as the terms of the original loan. The maximum repayment period for a loan reissued under this section shall not exceed the remainder of the period which would have been permitted on the original loan. If the lender holds more than one loan insured under subpart I&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1092a_2_target" name="1092a_2">2</a></sup> of part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act, the maximum repayment period for all such loans may extend to the latest date permitted for any individual loan. Any reissued loan may be consolidated with any other Health Education Assistance Loan as provided in the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], and, with the concurrence of the borrower, repayment of any such loans during any period may be made in amounts that are less than the interest that accrues on such loans during that period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Preparations for Year 2000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to ensure that the processing, delivery, and administration of grant, loan, and work assistance provided under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 is not interrupted due to operational problems related to the inability of computer systems to indicate accurately dates after December 31, 1999, the Secretary of Education shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) take such actions as are necessary to ensure that all internal and external systems, hardware, and data exchange infrastructure administered by the Department that are necessary for the processing, delivery, and administration of the grant, loan, and work assistance are Year 2000 compliant by March 31, 1999, such that there will be no business interruption after December 31, 1999;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) ensure that the Robert T. Stafford Federal Student Loan Program and the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program are equal in level of priority with respect to addressing, and that resources are managed to equally provide for successful resolution of, the Year 2000 computer problem in both programs by December 31, 1999;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) work with the Department's various data exchange partners under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 to fully test all data exchange routes for Year 2000 compliance via end-to-end testing, and submit a report describing the parameters and results of such tests to the Comptroller General not later than March 31, 1999;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that the Inspector General of the Department (or an external, independent entity selected by the Inspector General) performs and publishes a risk assessment of the systems and hardware under the Department's management, that has been reviewed by an independent entity, and make such assessment publicly available not later than 60 days after October 7, 1998;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) not later than June 30, 1999, ensure that the Inspector General (or an external, independent entity selected by the Inspector General) conducts a review of the Department's Year 2000 compliance for the processing, delivery, and administration of grant, loan, and work assistance, and submits a report reflecting the results of that review to the Chairperson of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the Chairperson of the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) develop a contingency plan to ensure the programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 will continue to run uninterrupted in the event of widespread disruptions in the flow of accurate computerized data, which contingency plan shall include a prioritization of mission critical systems and strategies to allow data partners to transfer data through alternate means; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) alert Congress at the earliest possible time if mission critical deadlines will not be met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Postponement authority for Year 2000</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the purpose of this subsection to provide the Secretary with the flexibility necessary to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensure that the resources and capabilities of institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies are not overburdened by the combination of student aid processing and delivery requirements added or modified by the amendments made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 and by the changes required to ensure that the systems of the institutions, lenders and guaranty agencies are Year 2000 compliant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) avoid the disruption of grant, loan, or work assistance funds awarded to students because of Year 2000 compliance problems at a substantial number of institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to postpone</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may postpone, for a period of time described in paragraph (3), the implementation of any requirements under part B, C, D, or F of this subchapter that are added or modified by the amendments made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 related to the processing or delivery of grant, loan, and work assistance (which shall not include the determination of need for such assistance) provided under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) implementation of such requirements would require extensive changes to the existing systems of institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) postponement is necessary to avoid jeopardizing the ability of a substantial number of institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies to ensure that all of the systems of the institutions, lenders, or guaranty agencies related to the processing or delivery of such assistance function successfully after December 31, 1999; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promptly publishes in the Federal Register a list of, and notifies Congress of, any provisions, the implementation of which the Secretary intends to postpone, with the reasons for such postponement.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:527 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exceptions to authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not postpone the implementation of one or more provisions described in this subsection longer than the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the period of time that the Secretary determines necessary to ensure that the processing and delivery systems of the institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1098c_1_target" name="1098c_1">1</a></sup> are capable of functioning successfully after December 31, 1999; or</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No accrediting agency or association may be determined by the Secretary to be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered for the purposes of this chapter or for other Federal purposes, unless the agency or association meets criteria established by the Secretary pursuant to this section. The Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, establish criteria for such determinations. Such criteria shall include an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement. Such criteria shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the accrediting agency or association shall be a State, regional, or national agency or association and shall demonstrate the ability and the experience to operate as an accrediting agency or association within the State, region, or nationally, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such agency or association&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) for the purpose of participation in programs under this chapter, has a voluntary membership of institutions of higher education and has as a principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher education; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for the purpose of participation in other programs administered by the Department of Education or other Federal agencies, has a voluntary membership and has as its principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher education or programs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is an agency or association that, for the purpose of determining eligibility for student assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, conducts accreditation through (i) a voluntary membership organization of individuals participating in a profession, or (ii) an agency or association which has as its principal purpose the accreditation of programs within institutions, which institutions are accredited by another agency or association recognized by the Secretary;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if such agency or association is an agency or association described in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) subparagraph (A)(i) of paragraph (2), then such agency or association is separate and independent, both administratively and financially of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2), then such agency or association has been recognized by the Secretary on or before October 1, 1991; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) and such agency or association has been recognized by the Secretary on or before October 1, 1991, then the Secretary may waive the requirement that such agency or association is separate and independent, both administratively and financially of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization upon a demonstration that the existing relationship has not served to compromise the independence of its accreditation process;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such agency or association consistently applies and enforces standards that ensure that the courses or programs of instruction, training, or study offered by the institution of higher education, including distance education courses or programs, are of sufficient quality to achieve, for the duration of the accreditation period, the stated objective for which the courses or the programs are offered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the standards for accreditation of the agency or association assess the institution's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) success with respect to student achievement in relation to the institution's mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of course completion, State licensing examinations, and job placement rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) curricula;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) faculty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) facilities, equipment, and supplies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) student support services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading and advertising;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) measures of program length and the objectives of the degrees or credentials offered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) record of student complaints received by, or available to, the agency or association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) record of compliance with its program responsibilities under this subchapter and <!-- PDFPage:529 -->part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 based on the most recent student loan default rate data provided by the Secretary, the results of financial or compliance audits, program reviews, and such other information as the Secretary may provide to the agency or association;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that subparagraphs (A), (H), and (J) shall not apply to agencies or associations described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such agency or association shall apply procedures throughout the accrediting process, including evaluation and withdrawal proceedings, that comply with due process, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) adequate specification of requirements and deficiencies at the institution of higher education or program being examined;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notice of an opportunity for a hearing by any such institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the right to appeal any adverse action against any such institution; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) such agency or association shall make available to the public, upon request, and to the Secretary, and the State licensing or authorizing agency a summary of any review resulting in a final accrediting decision involving denial, termination, or suspension of accreditation, together with the comments of the affected institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Separate and independent&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of subsection (a)(3) of this section, the term &ldquo;separate and independent&rdquo; means that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the members of the postsecondary education governing body of the accrediting agency or association are not elected or selected by the board or chief executive officer of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) among the membership of the board of the accrediting agency or association there shall be one public member (who is not a member of any related trade or membership organization) for each six members of the board, with a minimum of one such public member, and guidelines are established for such members to avoid conflicts of interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) dues to the accrediting agency or association are paid separately from any dues paid to any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the budget of the accrediting agency or association is developed and determined by the accrediting agency or association without review or resort to consultation with any other entity or organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Operating procedures required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No accrediting agency or association may be recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered by an institution seeking to participate in the programs authorized under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, unless the agency or association&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) performs, at regularly established intervals, on-site inspections and reviews of institutions of higher education (which may include unannounced site visits) with particular focus on educational quality and program effectiveness, and ensures that accreditation team members are well-trained and knowledgeable with respect to their responsibilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requires that any institution of higher education subject to its jurisdiction which plans to establish a branch campus submit a business plan, including projected revenues and expenditures, prior to opening the branch campus;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) agrees to conduct, as soon as practicable, but within a period of not more than 6 months of the establishment of a new branch campus or a change of ownership of an institution of higher education, an on-site visit of that branch campus or of the institution after a change of ownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) requires that teach-out agreements among institutions are subject to approval by the accrediting agency or association consistent with standards promulgated by such agency or association;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) maintains and makes publicly available written materials regarding standards and procedures for accreditation, appeal procedures, and the accreditation status of each institution subject to its jurisdiction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) discloses publicly whenever an institution of higher education subject to its jurisdiction is being considered for accreditation or reaccreditation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Length of recognition</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Initial arbitration rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not recognize the accreditation of any institution of higher education unless the institution of higher education agrees to submit any dispute involving the final denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation to initial arbitration prior to any other legal action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action brought by an institution of higher education seeking accreditation from, or accredited by, an accrediting agency or association recognized by the Secretary for the purpose of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and involving the denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation of the institution of higher education, shall be brought in the appropriate United States district court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limitation on scope of criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit the Secretary to establish criteria for ac<!-- PDFPage:530 -->crediting agencies or associations that are not required by this section. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or limit any accrediting agency or association from adopting additional standards not provided for in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Change of accrediting agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is in the process of changing its accrediting agency or association, unless the eligible institution submits to the Secretary all materials relating to the prior accreditation, including materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing the accrediting agency or association.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Dual accreditation rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is accredited, as an institution, by more than one accrediting agency or association, unless the institution submits to each such agency and association and to the Secretary the reasons for accreditation by more than one such agency or association and demonstrates to the Secretary reasonable cause for its accreditation by more than one agency or association. If the institution is accredited, as an institution, by more than one accrediting agency or association, the institution shall designate which agency's accreditation shall be utilized in determining the institution's eligibility for programs under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Impact of loss of accreditation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An institution may not be certified or recertified as an institution of higher education under section 1002 of this title and subpart 3 of this part or participate in any of the other programs authorized by this chapter if such institution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not currently accredited by any agency or association recognized by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated for cause during the preceding 24 months, unless such withdrawal, revocation, or termination has been rescinded by the same accrediting agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) has withdrawn from accreditation voluntarily under a show cause or suspension order during the preceding 24 months, unless such order has been rescinded by the same accrediting agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Religious institution rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (j) of this section, the Secretary shall allow an institution that has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated, or has voluntarily withdrawn from an accreditation agency, to remain certified as an institution of higher education under section 1002 of this title and subpart 3 of this part for a period sufficient to allow such institution to obtain alternative accreditation, if the Secretary determines that the reason for the withdrawal, revocation, or termination&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is related to the religious mission or affiliation of the institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not related to the accreditation criteria provided for in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Limitation, suspension, or termination of recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary determines that an accrediting agency or association has failed to apply effectively the criteria in this section, or is otherwise not in compliance with the requirements of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after notice and opportunity for a hearing, limit, suspend, or terminate the recognition of the agency or association; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require the agency or association to take appropriate action to bring the agency or association into compliance with such requirements within a timeframe specified by the Secretary, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such timeframe shall not exceed 12 months unless the Secretary extends such period for good cause; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the agency or association fails to bring the agency or association into compliance within such timeframe, the Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, limit, suspend, or terminate the recognition of the agency or association.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may determine that an accrediting agency or association has failed to apply effectively the standards provided in this section if an institution of higher education seeks and receives accreditation from the accrediting agency or association during any period in which the institution is the subject of any interim action by another accrediting agency or association, described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (2)(B), or (2)(C) of subsection (a) of this section, leading to the suspension, revocation, or termination of accreditation or the institution has been notified of the threatened loss of accreditation, and the due process procedures required by such suspension, revocation, termination, or threatened loss have not been completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Limitation on Secretary's authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may only recognize accrediting agencies or associations which accredit institutions of higher education for the purpose of enabling such institutions to establish eligibility to participate in the programs under this chapter or which accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling them to establish eligibility to participate in other programs administered by the Department of Education or other Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Independent evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of the performance of all accrediting agencies or associations which seek recognition by the Secretary in order to determine whether such accrediting agencies or associations meet the criteria established by this section. The Secretary shall conduct an independent evaluation of the information provided by such agency or association. Such evaluation shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the solicitation of third-party information concerning the performance of the accrediting agency or association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) site visits, including unannounced site visits as appropriate, at accrediting agencies <!-- PDFPage:531 -->and associations, and, at the Secretary's discretion, at representative member institutions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall place a priority for review of accrediting agencies or associations on those agencies or associations that accredit institutions of higher education that participate most extensively in the programs authorized by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 and on those agencies or associations which have been the subject of the most complaints or legal actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall consider all available relevant information concerning the compliance of the accrediting agency or association with the criteria provided for in this section, including any complaints or legal actions against such agency or association. In cases where deficiencies in the performance of an accreditation agency or association with respect to the requirements of this section are noted, the Secretary shall take these deficiencies into account in the recognition process. The Secretary shall not, under any circumstances, base decisions on the recognition or denial of recognition of accreditation agencies or associations on criteria other than those contained in this section. When the Secretary decides to recognize an accrediting agency or association, the Secretary shall determine the agency or association's scope of recognition. If the agency or association reviews institutions offering distance education courses or programs and the Secretary determines that the agency or association meets the requirements of this section, then the agency shall be recognized and the scope of recognition shall include accreditation of institutions offering distance education courses or programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall maintain sufficient documentation to support the conclusions reached in the recognition process, and, if the Secretary does not recognize any accreditation agency or association, shall make publicly available the reason for denying recognition, including reference to the specific criteria under this section which have not been fulfilled.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall by regulation provide procedures for the recognition of accrediting agencies or associations and for the appeal of the Secretary's decisions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Hispanic Americans are at high risk of not enrolling or graduating from institutions of higher education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Disparities between the enrollment of non-Hispanic white students and Hispanic students in postsecondary education are increasing. Between 1973 and 1994, enrollment of white secondary school graduates in 4-year institutions of higher education increased at a rate two times higher than that of Hispanic secondary school graduates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, Hispanic-serving institutions provide a significant proportion of postsecondary opportunities for Hispanic students.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Relative to other institutions of higher education, Hispanic-serving institutions are underfunded. Such institutions receive significantly less in State and local funding, per full-time equivalent student, than other institutions of higher education.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:540 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Hispanic-serving institutions are succeeding in educating Hispanic students despite significant resource problems that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) limit the ability of such institutions to expand and improve the academic programs of such institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) could imperil the financial and administrative stability of such institutions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) There is a national interest in remedying the disparities described in paragraphs (2) and (4) and ensuring that Hispanic students have an equal opportunity to pursue postsecondary opportunities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) expand educational opportunities for, and improve the academic attainment of, Hispanic students; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) expand and enhance the academic offerings, program quality, and institutional stability of colleges and universities that are educating the majority of Hispanic college students and helping large numbers of Hispanic students and other low-income individuals complete postsecondary degrees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide grants and related assistance to Hispanic-serving institutions to enable such institutions to improve and expand their capacity to serve Hispanic students and other low-income individuals.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1151. Grants to States for workplace and community transition training for incarcerated youth offenders</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Over 150,000 youth offenders age 21 and younger are incarcerated in the Nation's jails, juvenile facilities, and prisons.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:592 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Most youth offenders who are incarcerated have been sentenced as first-time adult felons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Approximately 75 percent of youth offenders are high school dropouts who lack basic literacy and life skills, have little or no job experience, and lack marketable skills.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The average incarcerated youth has attended school only through grade 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Most of these youths can be diverted from a life of crime into productive citizenship with available educational, vocational, work skills, and related service programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) If not involved with educational programs while incarcerated, almost all of these youths will return to a life of crime upon release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The average length of sentence for a youth offender is about 3 years. Time spent in prison provides a unique opportunity for education and training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Even with quality education and training provided during incarceration, a period of intense supervision, support, and counseling is needed upon release to ensure effective reintegration of youth offenders into society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Research consistently shows that the vast majority of incarcerated youths will not return to the public schools to complete their education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) There is a need for alternative educational opportunities during incarceration and after release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Youth offender&rdquo; defined</h4>
