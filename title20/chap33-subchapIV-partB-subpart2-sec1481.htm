<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) National technical assistance, support, and dissemination activities are necessary to <!-- PDFPage:727 -->ensure that subchapters II and III of this chapter are fully implemented and achieve quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Parents, teachers, administrators, and related services personnel need technical assistance and information in a timely, coordinated, and accessible manner in order to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results at the State and local levels for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Parent training and information activities have taken on increased importance in efforts to assist parents of a child with a disability in dealing with the multiple pressures of rearing such a child and are of particular importance in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensuring the involvement of such parents in planning and decisionmaking with respect to early intervention, educational, and transitional services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) achieving quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) providing such parents information on their rights and protections under this chapter to ensure improved early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) assisting such parents in the development of skills to participate effectively in the education and development of their children and in the transitions described in section 1474(b)(3)(C) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) supporting the roles of such parents as participants within partnerships seeking to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Providers of parent training and information activities need to ensure that such parents who have limited access to services and supports, due to economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers, are provided with access to appropriate parent training and information activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Parents of children with disabilities need information that helps the parents to understand the rights and responsibilities of their children under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The provision of coordinated technical assistance and dissemination of information to State and local agencies, institutions of higher education, and other providers of services to children with disabilities is essential in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) supporting the process of achieving systemic change;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) supporting actions in areas of priority specific to the improvement of early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) conveying information and assistance that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) based on current research (as of the date the information and assistance are conveyed);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) accessible and meaningful for use in supporting systemic-change activities of State and local partnerships; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) linked directly to improving early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) organizing systems and information networks for such information, based on modern technology related to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) storing and gaining access to information; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) distributing information in a systematic manner to parents, students, professionals, and policymakers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal support for carrying out technology research, technology development, and educational media services and activities has resulted in major innovations that have significantly improved early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Such Federal support is needed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to stimulate the development of software, interactive learning tools, and devices to address early intervention, educational, and transitional needs of children with disabilities who have certain disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to make information available on technology research, technology development, and educational media services and activities to individuals involved in the provision of early intervention, educational, and transitional services to children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to promote the integration of technology into curricula to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to provide incentives for the development of technology and media devices and tools that are not readily found or available because of the small size of potential markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to make resources available to pay for such devices and tools and educational media services and activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to promote the training of personnel&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to provide such devices, tools, services, and activities in a competent manner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to assist children with disabilities and their families in using such devices, tools, services, and activities; and</p>
