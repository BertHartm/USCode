<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) over the past 50 years institutions of higher education have expanded dramatically, while at the same time traditional sources of funding facilities maintenance and repair have declined and even disappeared in some instances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in order to meet the rising cost of educating students, resulting mainly from inflation and the higher costs of research, many colleges and universities made the choice to defer renovations and improvements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) overall, the need for capital investment by institutions of higher education has been estimated to exceed $60,000,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the deterioration of facilities has caused valuable research experiments and programs to be postponed, delayed or canceled; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the United States&rsquo; competitive position within the world economy is vulnerable if the <!-- PDFPage:513 -->necessary research facilities are not available to provide advanced training in the fields of science and technology.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1132b&ndash;5 of this title for a fiscal year is less than $50,000,000, then the Secretary shall award grants under this part on a competitive basis in accordance with subsection (h) of this section to institutions of higher education to carry out the activities described in section 1132b&ndash;3 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allotment formula</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of formula grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State higher education agency receiving an allotment pursuant to subparagraph (A), shall use such allotment to award grants, on a competitive basis, to institutions of higher education within the State to enable such institutions to carry out the activities described in section 1132b&ndash;3 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, any amount that the Secretary determines will not be available to a State higher education agency because such agency elects not to participate in the program assisted under this part shall be reallotted to other States in the same manner as the original allotments were made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Matching requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State matching requirement</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Equitable participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In awarding grants pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary or each State higher education agency shall ensure the equitable participation of both public and private eligible institutions within the State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that any eligible institution within a State has received, within the 2 preceding fiscal years, a direct, noncompetitive award of Federal funds for facilities construction, renovation, improvement or repair, then the eligible institution shall be ineligible to receive assistance under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Use for maintenance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An amount less than or equal to 10 percent of that portion of funds awarded under this part which is allotted by the recipient to meet costs of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) research and instructional instrumentation and equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) equipment and structural changes necessary to ensure the proper functioning of such research or instructional instrumentation and equipment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">may be allocated by the recipient for maintenance of equipment and changes described in paragraphs (1) and (2). Part or all of this percentage may also be applied to costs of upgrading such equipment and structural changes within 3 years of the date of initial use, if the <!-- PDFPage:514 -->recipient deems such upgrading essential to the continued usefulness of such research or instructional instrumentation and equipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Supplementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Grants awarded pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be used to supplement and not supplant other Federal, State, and local funds available for improvement of academic and library facilities.</p>
