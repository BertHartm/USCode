<p class="note-body">Section 8064(f)(1) of this title, referred to in subsec. (c), was in the original &ldquo;section 10302(e)(1)&rdquo;, meaning section 10302(e)(1) of Pub. L. 89&ndash;10, which was translated as reading section 10304(f)(1) of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 10302, which is classified to section 8062 of this title, does not contain a subsec. (e), and section 10304(f)(1) authorizes the award of grants to eligible applicants.</p>
