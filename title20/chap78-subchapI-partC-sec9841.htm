<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to establish an expert panel to provide information on promising practices for strengthening teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics at the elementary school and secondary school levels. The panel shall build on prior Federal efforts, such as efforts by the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, and shall synthesize scientific evidence pertaining to the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics teaching and learning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) National panel on promising practices in K&ndash;12 STEM teaching and learning</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall enter into a contract with the Center for Education of the National Academy of Sciences to establish and convene, not later than 1 year after August 9, 2007, an expert panel to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify promising practices for improving teaching and student achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in kindergarten through grade 12; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1639 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) examine and synthesize the scientific evidence pertaining to the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics teaching and learning.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Composition of national panel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The National Academy of Sciences shall ensure that the panel established under paragraph (1) represents scientists, engineers, mathematicians, technologists, computer and information technology experts, educators, principals, researchers with expertise in teaching and learning (including experts in cognitive science), and others with relevant expertise. The National Academy of Sciences shall ensure that the panel includes the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Representation of teachers and principals directly involved in teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in kindergarten through grade 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Representation of teachers and principals from diverse demographic groups and geographic areas, including urban, suburban, and rural schools.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Representation of teachers and principals from public and private schools.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualification of members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The members of the panel established under paragraph (1) shall be individuals who have expertise and experience relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) existing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) developing and improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curricula content;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) improving the academic achievement of students who are below grade level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) research on teaching or learning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorized activities of national panel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The panel established under subsection (b) shall identify&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promising practices in the effective teaching and learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics topics in kindergarten through grade 12;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) promising training and professional development techniques designed to help teachers increase their skills and expertise in improving student achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in kindergarten through grade 12;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) critical skills and skills progressions needed to enable students to acquire competence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and readiness for advanced secondary school and college level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics coursework;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) processes by which students with varying degrees of prior academic achievement and backgrounds learn effectively in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) areas in which existing data about promising practices in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education are insufficient.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The panel established under subsection (b) shall prepare a written report for the Secretary that presents the findings of the panel pursuant to this section and includes recommendations, based on the findings of the panel, to strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics teaching and learning in kindergarten through grade 12.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Dissemination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall disseminate the report under subsection (d) to the public, State educational agencies, and local educational agencies, and shall make the information in such report available, in an easy to understand format, on the website of the Department.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics promising practices</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reliability and measurement</h4>
