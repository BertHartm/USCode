<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rapid technological advances and global economic competition demand increased levels of skilled technical education preparation and readiness on the part of youths entering the workforce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) effective strategies reaching beyond the boundaries of traditional schooling are necessary to provide early and sustained intervention by parents, teachers, and educational institutions in the lives of students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a combination of nontraditional school-to-work technical education programs, using state-of-the-art equipment and appropriate technologies, will reduce the dropout rate for high school students in the United States and will produce youths who are mature, responsible, and motivated to build good lives for themselves;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the establishment of systematic technical education articulation agreements between secondary schools and postsecondary educational institutions is necessary for providing youths with skills in the liberal and practical arts and in basic academics, including literacy instruction in the English language, and with the intense technical preparation necessary for finding a position in a changing workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) by the year 2000 an estimated 15,000,000 manufacturing jobs will require more advanced technical skills, and an equal number of service jobs will become obsolete;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) more than 50 percent of jobs that are developing will require skills greater than those provided by existing educational programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) dropout rates in urban schools are 50 percent or higher, and more than 50 percent of all Hispanic youth drop out of high school; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) employers in the United States pay an estimated $210,000,000,000 annually for formal and informal training, remediation, and lost productivity as a result of untrained and unprepared youth joining, or attempting to join, the workforce of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide planning and demonstration grants to consortia of local educational agencies and postsecondary educational institutions, for the development and operation of 4-year programs designed to provide a tech-prep education program leading to a 2-year associate degree or a 2-year certificate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide, in a systematic manner, strong, comprehensive links between secondary schools and postsecondary educational institutions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for grants under this part are not sufficient to pay in full the total amount which approved applicants are eligible to receive under this part for such fiscal year, the Secretary shall first allocate to each such applicant which received funds under this part for the preceding fiscal year an amount equal to 100 percent of the product of the per capita payment for the preceding fiscal year and such applicant's Indian student count for the current program year, plus an amount equal to the actual cost of any increase to the per capita figure resulting from inflationary increases to necessary costs beyond the institution's control.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the per capita payment for any fiscal year shall be determined by dividing the amount available for grants to tribally controlled postsecondary vocational institutions under this part for such program year by the sum of the Indian student counts of such institutions for such program year. The Secretary shall, on the basis of the most accurate data available from the institutions, compute the Indian student count for any fiscal year for which such count was not used for the purpose of making allocations under this part.</p>
