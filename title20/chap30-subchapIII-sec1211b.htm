<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">In subsecs. (a), (d), and (e)(2), &ldquo;chapter 313 of title 49&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 [49 App. U.S.C. 2701 et seq.]&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Commercial Motor Vehicle Driver Safety Act of 1986 [49 <!-- PDFPage:607 -->App. U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] on authority of Pub. L. 103&ndash;272, &sect;6(b), July 5, 1994, 108 Stat. 1378, the first section of which enacted subtitles II, III, and V to X of Title 49, Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;26, known as the &ldquo;Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991&rdquo;, enacted section 373 of the Adult Education Act [this section]. Another section 373 of the Adult Education Act, with substantially identical text, was enacted by Pub. L. 102&ndash;73, title IV, &sect;401(a), July 25, 1991, 105 Stat. 354. However, section 401(b) of Pub. L. 102&ndash;73 provided that the section 373 of the Adult Education Act enacted by section 401(a) of Pub. L. 102&ndash;73 would &ldquo;not take effect if the Higher Education Amendments of 1991 are enacted before the enactment of this Act&rdquo;. Although Pub. L. 102&ndash;73 referred to the earlier law as the &ldquo;Higher Education Amendments of 1991&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991&rdquo;, only the section 373 of the Adult Education Act as enacted by Pub. L. 102&ndash;26 is set out in text, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.</p>
