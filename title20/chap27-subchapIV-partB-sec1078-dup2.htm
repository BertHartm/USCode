Whenever necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, the terms &ldquo;student&rdquo; and &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; as used in this part shall include a parent borrower under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation based on need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any loan under this section may be counted as part of the expected family contribution in the determination of need under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, <!-- PDFPage:314 -->but no loan may be made to any parent under this section for any academic year in excess of (A) the student's estimated cost of attendance, minus (B) other financial aid as certified by the eligible institution under section 1078(a)(2)(A) of this title. The annual insurable limit on account of any student shall not be deemed to be exceeded by a line of credit under which actual payments to the borrower will not be made in any year in excess of the annual limit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) PLUS loan disbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All loans made under this section shall be disbursed in accordance with the requirements of section 1078  7 of this title and shall be disbursed by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an electronic transfer of funds from the lender to the eligible institution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a check copayable to the eligible institution and the parent borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of principal and interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commencement of repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Repayment of principal on loans made under this section shall commence not later than 60 days after the date such loan is disbursed by the lender, subject to deferral during any period during which the parent meets the conditions required for a deferral under section 1077(a)(2)(C) or 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Capitalization of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest on loans made under this section for which payments of principal are deferred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, if agreed upon by the borrower and the lender (A) be paid monthly or quarterly, or (B) be added to the principal amount of the loan not more frequently than quarterly by the lender. Such capitalization of interest shall not be deemed to exceed the annual insurable limit on account of the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsidies prohibited</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest on loans made pursuant to this section shall be at the applicable rate of interest provided in section 1077a(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the periodic payment and the repayment schedule for any loan made pursuant to this section shall be established by assuming an interest rate equal to the applicable rate of interest at the time the repayment of the principal amount of the loan commences. At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Refinancing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Refinancing to secure combined payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An eligible lender may at any time consolidate loans held by it which are made under this section to a borrower, including loans which were made under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, under a single repayment schedule which provides for a single principal payment and a single payment of interest, and shall calculate the repayment period for each included loan from the date of the commencement of repayment of the most recent included loan. Unless the consolidated loan is obtained by a borrower who is electing to obtain variable interest under paragraph (2) or (3), such consolidated loan shall bear interest at the weighted average of the rates of all included loans. The extension of any repayment period of an included loan pursuant to this paragraph shall be reported (if required by them) to the Secretary or guaranty agency insuring the loan, as the case may be, but no additional insurance premiums shall be payable with respect to any such extension. The extension of the repayment period of any included loan shall not require the formal extension of the promissory note evidencing the included loan or the execution of a new promissory note, but shall be treated as an administrative forbearance of the repayment terms of the included loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Refinancing to secure variable interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An eligible lender may reissue a loan which was made under this section before July 1, 1987, or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, in order to permit the borrower to obtain the interest rate provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title. A lender offering to reissue a loan or loans for such purpose may charge a borrower an amount not to exceed $100 to cover the administrative costs of reissuing such loan or loans, not more than one-half of which shall be paid to the guarantor of the loan being reissued to cover costs of reissuance. Reissuance of a loan under this paragraph shall not affect any insurance applicable with respect to the loan, and no additional insurance fee may be charged to the borrower with respect to the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refinancing by discharge of previous loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A borrower who has applied to an original lender for reissuance of a loan under paragraph (2) and who is denied such reissuance may obtain a loan from another lender for the purpose of discharging the loan from such original lender. A loan made for such purpose&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall bear interest at the applicable rate of interest provided under section 1077a(c)(4) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall not result in the extension of the duration of the note (other than as permitted under subsection (c)(5)(B) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may be subject to an additional insurance fee but shall not be subject to the administrative cost charge permitted by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall be applied to discharge the borrower from any remaining obligation to the original lender with respect to the original loan.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:315 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certification in lieu of promissory note presentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each new lender may accept certification from the original lender of the borrower's original loan in lieu of presentation of the original promissory note.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notification to borrowers of availability of refinancing options</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each holder of a loan made under this section or under this section as in effect prior to October 17, 1986, shall, not later than October 1, 1987, in the case of loans made before October 17, 1986, notify the borrower of such loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) of the refinancing options for which the borrower is eligible under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) of those options which will be made available by the holder and of the practical consequences of such options in terms of interest rates and monthly and total payments for a set of loan examples; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that, with respect to any option that the holder will not make available, the holder will, to the extent practicable, refer the borrower to an eligible lender offering such option.</p>
