<p class="statutory-body">After the third year of the plan described in section 6319(a)(2) of this title, if the State educational agency determines, based on the reports described in section 6319(b)(1) of this title, that the local educational agency has failed to make progress toward meeting the annual measurable objectives described in section 6319(a)(2) of this title, and has failed to make adequate yearly progress as described under section 6311(b)(2)(B) of this title, for 3 consecutive years, the State educational agency shall enter into an agreement with such local educational agency on the use of that agency's funds under this part.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall allow the use of such funds to fund a paraprofessional hired after that date if the local educational agency can demonstrate that the hiring is to fill a vacancy created by the departure of another paraprofessional funded under subchapter I of this chapter and such new paraprofessional satisfies the requirements of section 6319(c) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may allow the use of such funds to fund a paraprofessional hired after that date if the local educational agency can demonstrate&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that there is an increased need for translators or assistance with parental involvement activities.</p>
