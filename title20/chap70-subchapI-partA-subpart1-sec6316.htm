<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each local educational agency receiving funds under this part shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) use the State academic assessments and other indicators described in the State plan to review annually the progress of each school served under this part to determine whether the school is making adequate yearly progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at the local educational agency's discretion, use any academic assessments or any other academic indicators described in the local educational agency's plan under section 6312(b)(1)(A) and (B) of this title to review annually the progress of each school served under this part to determine whether the school is making adequate yearly progress as defined in section 6311(b)(2) of this title, except that the local educational agency may not use such indicators (other than as provided for in section 6311(b)(2)(I) of this title) if the indicators reduce the number or change the schools that would otherwise be subject to school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under this section if such additional indicators were not used, but may identify additional schools for school improvement or in need of corrective action or restructuring;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) publicize and disseminate the results of the local annual review described in para<!-- PDFPage:1217 -->graph (1) to parents, teachers, principals, schools, and the community so that the teachers, principals, other staff, and schools can continually refine, in an instructionally useful manner, the program of instruction to help all children served under this part meet the challenging State student academic achievement standards established under section 6311(b)(1) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) review the effectiveness of the actions and activities the schools are carrying out under this part with respect to parental involvement, professional development, and other activities assisted under this part.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deadline</h4>
