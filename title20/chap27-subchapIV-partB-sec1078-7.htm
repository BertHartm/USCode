<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Multiple disbursement required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Two disbursements required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The proceeds of any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part that is made for any period of enrollment shall be disbursed in 2 or more installments, none of which exceeds one-half of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum interval required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The interval between the first and second such installments shall be not less than one-half of such period of enrollment, except as necessary to permit the second installment to be disbursed at the beginning of the second semester, quarter, or similar division of such period of enrollment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disbursement and endorsement requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) First year students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The first installment of the proceeds of any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part that is made to a student borrower who is entering the first year of a program of undergraduate education, and who has not previously obtained a loan under this part, shall not (regardless of the amount of such loan or the duration of the period of enrollment) be presented by the institution to the student for endorsement until 30 days after the borrower begins a course of study, but may be delivered to the eligible institution prior to the end of that 30-day period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The proceeds of any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part that is made to any student other than a student described in paragraph (1) shall not be disbursed more than 30 days prior to the beginning of the period of enrollment for which the loan is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Method of multiple disbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Disbursements under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be made in accordance with a schedule provided by the institution (under section 1078(a)(2)(A)(i)(III) of this title) that complies with the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may be made directly by the lender or, in the case of a loan under sections 1078 and 1078&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1078-7_1_target" name="1078-7_1">1</a></sup> of this title, may be disbursed pursuant to the escrow provisions of section 1078(i) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, may, with the permission of the borrower, be disbursed by the lender on a weekly or monthly basis, provided that the proceeds of the loan are disbursed in substantially equal weekly or monthly installments, as the case may be, over the period of enrollment for which the loan is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Withholding of second disbursement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Withdrawing students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A lender or escrow agent that is informed by the borrower or the institution that the borrower has ceased to be enrolled before the disbursement of the second or any succeeding installment shall withhold such disbursement. Any disbursement which is so withheld shall be credited to the borrower's loan and treated as a prepayment thereon.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Students receiving over-awards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sum of a disbursement for any student and the other financial aid obtained by such student exceeds the amount of assistance for which the student is eligible under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, the institution such student is attending shall withhold and return to the lender or escrow agent the portion (or all) of such installment that exceeds such eligible amount, except that overawards permitted pursuant to section 2753(b)(4) of title 42 shall not be construed to be overawards for purposes of this paragraph. Any portion (or all) of a disbursement installment which is so returned shall be credited to the borrower's loan and treated as a prepayment thereon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion of consolidation and foreign study loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of a loan made under section 1078&ndash;3 of this title or made to a student to cover the cost of attendance at an eligible institution outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Beginning of period of enrollment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a period of enrollment begins on the first day that classes begin for the applicable period of enrollment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sales prior to disbursement prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An eligible lender shall not sell or transfer a promissory note for any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part until the final disbursement of such loan has been made, except that the prohibition of this subsection shall not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sale of the loan does not result in a change in the identity of the party to whom payments will be made for the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the first disbursement of such loan has been made.</p>
