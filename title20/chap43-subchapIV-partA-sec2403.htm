<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the future need for skilled workers and the extent to which job apprenticeship programs could meet such future workforce needs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the appropriate age or grade level for students to enter job apprenticeship programs (such as secondary students, postsecondary students, or both);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the potential for such programs to reduce the dropout rate, place more qualified workers in the workplace, provide continuing education, including postsecondary opportunities, and increase the lifetime earnings of those who participate in such a job apprenticeship program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the issues in obtaining labor and management utilization of skills, certification for employee recruitment, promotion, and other purposes, and issues in creating and improving such certification to reliably and validly reflect the changing structure of work in the skills certified;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the training wage appropriate for an apprentice;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the estimated value and productivity of apprentices to business;</p>
