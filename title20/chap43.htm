Any such reallotment among other States shall occur on such dates during the same year as the Secretary shall fix, and shall be made on the basis of criteria established by regulation.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2341. Distribution of funds to secondary school programs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section and section 2341b of this title, each State shall distribute funds available in any fiscal year for secondary school vocational education programs to local educational agencies within the State as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) From 70 percent of such funds, each local educational agency shall be allocated an amount that bears the same relationship to such 70 percent as the amount such local educational agency was allocated under section 1124 or such section's predecessor authority of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6333] in the preceding fiscal year bears to the total amount received under such section by local educational agencies in the State in such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) From 20 percent of such funds, each local educational agency shall be allocated an amount that bears the same relationship to such 20 percent as the number of students with handicaps who have individualized education programs under section 1414(a)(5) of this title served by such local educational agency in the preceding fiscal year bears to the total number of such students served by local educational agencies in the State in such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) From 10 percent of such funds, each local educational agency shall be allocated an amount that bears the same relationship to such 10 percent as the number of students enrolled in schools and adults enrolled in training programs under the jurisdiction of such local educational agency in the preceding fiscal year bears to the number of students enrolled in schools and adults enrolled in training programs under the jurisdiction of all local educational agencies in the State in such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum grant amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no local educational agency shall be eligible for a grant under this part unless the amount allocated to such agency under subsection (a) of this section is not less than $15,000. A local educational agency may enter into a consortium with other local educational agencies for purposes of meeting the minimum grant requirement of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The State may waive the application of paragraph (1) in any case in which the local educational agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is located in a rural, sparsely-populated area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) demonstrates that the agency is unable to enter into a consortium for purposes of providing services under this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any amounts which are not allocated by reason of paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) shall be redistributed to local educational agencies that meet the requirements of paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limited jurisdiction agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In applying the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, no State board receiving assistance under this chapter shall allocate funds to a local educational agency that serves only elementary schools, but shall distribute such funds to the local or regional educational agency which provides secondary school services to secondary school students in the same attendance area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount to be allocated under paragraph (1) to a local educational agency that has jurisdiction only over secondary schools shall be determined based on the number of students <!-- PDFPage:811 -->that entered such secondary schools in the previous year from the elementary schools involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allocations to area vocational education schools and intermediate educational agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State shall distribute funds available for secondary school vocational education programs to the appropriate area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency in any case in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency and the local educational agency concerned&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) have formed or will form a consortium for the purpose of receiving funds under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) have entered into or will enter into a cooperative arrangement for such purpose; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency serves an approximately equal or greater proportion of students with handicaps and students who are economically disadvantaged than the proportion of such students attending the secondary schools under the jurisdiction of all of the local educational agencies sending students to the area vocational education school or the intermediate educational agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the area vocational education school, intermediate educational agency, or local educational agency demonstrates that it is unable to meet the criterion described in clause (i) due to the lack of interest by students described in clause (i) in attending vocational education programs in that area school or intermediate educational agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency meets the requirements of paragraph (1), then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount that would otherwise be distributed to the local educational agency shall be allocated to the area vocational education school, the intermediate educational agency, and the local educational agency based on each school's or entity's relative share of students described in paragraph (1)(B)(i) who are attending vocational education programs that meet the requirements of section 2342 of this title (based, if practicable, on the average enrollment for the prior 3 years); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such amount may be allocated on the basis of an agreement between the local educational agency and the area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For the purposes of this subsection, the State may determine the number of economically disadvantaged students attending vocational education programs on the basis of eligibility for any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Free or reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Benefits under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 [7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Services under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Other indices of economic status including estimates of such indices, if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such indices are more representative of such number.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a State elects to use more than 1 factor described in subparagraph (A) for purposes of making the determination described in such subparagraph, the State shall ensure that the data used is not duplicative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The State board shall establish an appeals procedure for resolution of any dispute arising between a local educational agency and an area vocational education school or an intermediate educational agency with respect to the allocation procedures described in this section, including the decision of a local educational agency to leave a consortium.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) any local educational agency receiving an allocation which is not sufficient to conduct a program which meets the requirements of section 2342(c) of this title is encouraged to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) form a consortium or enter into a cooperative agreement with an area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency offering programs that meet the requirements of section 2342(c) of this title and that are accessible to economically disadvantaged students and students with handicaps served by such local educational agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) transfer such allocation to the area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rapid technological advances and global economic competition demand increased levels of skilled technical education preparation and readiness on the part of youths entering the workforce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) effective strategies reaching beyond the boundaries of traditional schooling are necessary to provide early and sustained intervention by parents, teachers, and educational institutions in the lives of students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a combination of nontraditional school-to-work technical education programs, using state-of-the-art equipment and appropriate technologies, will reduce the dropout rate for high school students in the United States and will produce youths who are mature, responsible, and motivated to build good lives for themselves;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:822 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the establishment of systematic technical education articulation agreements between secondary schools and postsecondary educational institutions is necessary for providing youths with skills in the liberal and practical arts and in basic academics, including literacy instruction in the English language, and with the intense technical preparation necessary for finding a position in a changing workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) by the year 2000 an estimated 15,000,000 manufacturing jobs will require more advanced technical skills, and an equal number of service jobs will become obsolete;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) more than 50 percent of jobs that are developing will require skills greater than those provided by existing educational programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) dropout rates in urban schools are 50 percent or higher, and more than 50 percent of all Hispanic youth drop out of high school; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) employers in the United States pay an estimated $210,000,000,000 annually for formal and informal training, remediation, and lost productivity as a result of untrained and unprepared youth joining, or attempting to join, the workforce of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide planning and demonstration grants to consortia of local educational agencies and postsecondary educational institutions, for the development and operation of 4-year programs designed to provide a tech-prep education program leading to a 2-year associate degree or a 2-year certificate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide, in a systematic manner, strong, comprehensive links between secondary schools and postsecondary educational institutions.</p>
