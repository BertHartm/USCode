<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of qualifying institutions of higher education for participation in programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, the Secretary shall determine the legal authority to operate within a State, the accreditation status, and the administrative capability and financial responsibility of an institution of higher education in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requires a specific description of the relationship between a main campus of an institution of higher education and all of its branches, including a description of the student aid processing that is performed by the main campus and that which is performed at its branches;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) requires such other information as the Secretary determines will ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 with respect to eligibility, accreditation, administrative capability and financial responsibility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Financial responsibility standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall determine whether an institution has the financial responsibility required by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 on the basis of whether the institution is able&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to provide the services described in its official publications and statements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with the requirements of this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to meet all of its financial obligations, including (but not limited to) refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if an institution fails to meet criteria prescribed by the Secretary with respect to operating losses, net worth, asset-to-liabilities ratios, or operating fund deficits then the institution shall provide the Secretary with satisfactory evidence of its financial responsibility in accordance with paragraph (3). Such criteria shall take into account any differences in generally accepted accounting principles, and the financial statements required thereunder, that are applicable to for profit and nonprofit institutions. The Secretary shall take into account an institution's total financial circumstances in making a determination of its ability to meet the standards herein required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall determine an institution to be financially responsible, notwithstanding the institution's failure to meet the criteria under paragraphs (1) and (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such institution submits to the Secretary third-party financial guarantees, such as performance bonds or letters of credit payable to the Secretary, which third-party financial guarantees shall equal not less than one-half of the annual potential liabilities of such institution to the Secretary for funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, including loan obligations discharged pursuant to section 1087 of this title, and to students for refunds of insti<!-- PDFPage:461 -->tutional charges, including funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such institution has its liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of a State, or its equivalent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such institution establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary, with the support of a financial statement audited by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the institution has sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of the institution, including the ability to meet all of its financial obligations (including refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such institution has met standards of financial responsibility, prescribed by the Secretary by regulation, that indicate a level of financial strength not less than those required in paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an institution of higher education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction for which the institution awards an associate or baccalaureate degree fails to meet the ratio of current assets to current liabilities imposed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall waive that particular requirement for that institution if the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there is no reasonable doubt as to its continued solvency and ability to deliver quality educational services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is current in its payment of all current liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and withholding taxes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) it has substantial equity in school-occupied facilities, the acquisition of which was the direct cause of its failure to meet the current operating ratio requirement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The determination as to whether an institution has met the standards of financial responsibility provided for in paragraphs (2) and (3)(C) shall be based on an audited and certified financial statement of the institution. Such audit shall be conducted by a qualified independent organization or person in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Such statement shall be submitted to the Secretary at the time such institution is considered for certification or recertification under this section. If the institution is permitted to be certified (provisionally or otherwise) and such audit does not establish compliance with paragraph (2), the Secretary may require that additional audits be submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Secretary shall establish requirements for the maintenance by an institution of higher education of sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required refunds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall provide for a process under which the Secretary shall exempt an institution of higher education from the requirements described in subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that the institution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is located in a State that has a tuition recovery fund that ensures that the institution meets the requirements of subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) contributes to the fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) otherwise has legal authority to operate within the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administrative capacity standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) maintenance of records;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may, to the extent necessary to protect the financial interest of the United States, require&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the assumption of personal liability, by one or more individuals who exercise substantial control over such institution, as determined by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2), for financial losses to the Federal Government, student assistance recipients, and other program participants for funds under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, and civil and criminal monetary penalties authorized under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, an ownership interest is defined as a share of the legal or beneficial ownership or control of, or a right to share in the proceeds of the operation of, an institution or institution's parent corporation. An ownership interest may include, but is not limited to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall not impose the requirements described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) on an institution that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has not been subjected to a limitation, suspension, or termination action by the Secretary or a guaranty agency within the preceding 5 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has not had, during its 2 most recent audits of the institutions conduct of programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, an audit finding that resulted in the institution being required to repay an amount greater than 5 percent of the funds the institution received from programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 for any year;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall ensure that prompt action is taken by the Department on any application required under subsection (b) of this section. The personnel of the Department of Education shall conduct a site visit at each institution before certifying or recertifying its eligibility for purposes of any program under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42. The Secretary may establish priorities by which institutions are to receive site visits, and may coordinate such visits with site visits by States, guaranty agencies, and accrediting bodies in order to eliminate duplication, and reduce administrative burden. The Secretary may charge reasonable fees to cover the expenses of certification and site visits and, to the extent permitted by appropriations Acts, may retain such fees to cover such expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Time limitations on, and renewal of, eligibility</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall establish a schedule for the expiration of the eligibility for purposes of any such program of all institutions of higher education within the 5-year period specified in paragraph (1).

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the Secretary withdraws the approval of any accrediting agency, an institution of higher education which meets the requirements of accreditation, eligibility, and certification on the day prior to such withdrawal, the <!-- PDFPage:463 -->Secretary may, notwithstanding the withdrawal, continue the eligibility of the institution of higher education to participate in the programs authorized by this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the withdrawal of approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, prior to the end of a period of provisional certification under this subsection, the Secretary determines that the institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, the Secretary may terminate the institution's participation in programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Treatment of changes of ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An eligible institution of higher education that has had a change in ownership resulting in a change of control shall not qualify to participate in programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 after the change in control (except as provided in paragraph (3)) unless it establishes that it meets the requirements of section 1088 of this title (other than the requirements in subsections (b)(5) and (c)(3)) and this section after such change in control.</p>
