<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the number of children counted for grants under section 6333(c) of this title, before application of the weighted child count described in subsection (c) of this section, is at least 5 percent of the total number of children aged 5 to 17 years, inclusive, in the school district of the local educational agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year for which the Secretary allocates funds under this section on the basis of counties, funds made available as a result of applying this subsection shall be reallocated by the State educational agency to other eligible local educational agencies in the State in proportion to the distribution of other funds under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Weighted child count</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Weights for allocations to counties</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each fiscal year for which the Secretary uses county population data to calculate grants, the weighted child count used to determine a county's allocation under this section is the larger of the two amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) By percentage of children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount referred to in subparagraph (A) is determined by adding&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the number of such children who constitute more than 15.00 percent, but not more than 19.00 percent, of such population, multiplied by 1.75;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the number of children determined under section 6333(c) of this title who constitute not more than 2,311, inclusive, of the county's total population aged 5 to 17, inclusive, multiplied by 1.0;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the number of such children between 2,312 and 7,913, inclusive, in such population, multiplied by 1.5;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the number of such children between 7,914 and 23,917, inclusive, in such population, multiplied by 2.0;</p>
