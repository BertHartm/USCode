The President is requested in the making of such appointments to give consideration to such recommendations as may from time to time be submitted to him by leading national organizations concerned with the humanities. In making such appointments, the President shall give due regard to equitable representation of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities who are involved in the humanities.</p>

No member shall be eligible for reappointment during the two-year period following the expiration of such member's term. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection, a member shall serve after the expiration of such member's term until such member's successor takes office.</p>

In the case of any application involving $30,000, or less, the Chairperson may approve or disapprove such request if such action is taken pursuant to the terms of a delegation of authority from the Council to the Chairperson, and provided that each such action by the Chairperson shall be reviewed by the Council: <em>Provided,</em> That the terms of any such delegation of authority shall not permit obligations for expenditure of funds under such delegation for any fiscal year which exceed an amount equal to 10 per centum of the sums appropriated for that fiscal year pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of section 960(a) of this title.</p>
