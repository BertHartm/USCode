Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the Secretary's calculation of its cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce its cohort default rate for any of the three fiscal years below the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, exceptional mitigating circumstances that would make the application of this paragraph inequitable.</p>

Each eligible lender of a loan made under section 1078  1<sup><a href="#1085_2_target" name="1085_2">2</a></sup> of this title (or a loan made under section 1078 3 of this title a portion of which is used to repay a loan made under section 1078  1<sup><a href="#1085_2_target" name="1085_2">2</a></sup> of this title) shall provide the guaranty agency with the information necessary to determine when the loan entered repayment for purposes of this subsection, and the guaranty agency shall provide such information to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations to prevent evasions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a default rate determination under this subsection through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control, or any similar device.</p>
