<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;entity&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;firm, corporation, partnership, or association&rdquo; to use a single broad term clarifying that the prohibition applies to any kind of organization in which the person or firm has a substantial interest. The words &ldquo;containing the name of such persons or firms&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;individual&rdquo; for consistency in the subsection.</p>
