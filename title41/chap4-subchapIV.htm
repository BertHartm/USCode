<p class="note-body">In order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, it is necessary to secure broad-based competition for Federal contracts. This broad competition is best achieved where there is an expansive pool of potential contractors capable of producing quality goods and services at competitive prices. A great and largely untapped opportunity for expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in this Nation's economically distressed communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically distressed communities and ensuring that those contractors become viable businesses for the long term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement and help to empower those communities. Fostering growth of long-term viable contractors will be promoted by offering appropriate incentives to qualified businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 486(a) of title 40, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

In developing such policies and procedures, the Secretary shall consider the size of the qualified businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Monitoring and Evaluation</em>. The Secretary shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) monitor the implementation and operation of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order;</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) by December 1 of each year, issue a report to the President on the status and effectiveness of the program.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Implementation Guidelines</em>. In implementing this order, the Secretary shall:</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) draft all rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to implement this order within 90 days of the date of this order; and</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Area of general economic distress&rdquo; shall be defined, for all urban and rural communities, as any census tract that has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or any designated Federal Empowerment Zone, Supplemental Empowerment Zone, Enhanced Enterprise Community, or Enterprise Community.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;253. Competition requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procurement through full and open competition; competitive procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (g) of this section and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by statute, an executive agency in conducting a procurement for property or services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of this title and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the competitive procedures appropriate under the circumstance, an executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall solicit sealed bids if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding sources about their bids; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) there is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under clause (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of particular source; restriction of solicitation to small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain any alternative source or sources of supply for that property or service if the agency head determines that to do so&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any anticipated procurement, of such property or services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) would be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development ca<!-- PDFPage:60 -->pability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of such property or service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such supplies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures, but excluding other than small business concerns in furtherance of sections 638 and 644 of title 15;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A contract awarded pursuant to the competitive procedures referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be subject to the justification and approval required by subsection (f)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a class of purchases or contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of noncompetitive procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization, (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center, or (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or agency, or to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States Government and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for such government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (h)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#253_1_target" name="253_1">1</a></sup> of this section, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another executive agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the disclosure of the executive agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the head of the executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Property or services deemed available from only one source; nondelegable authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purposes of applying subsection (c)(1) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services shall be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative concept the substance of which is not otherwise available to the United States and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in (i) substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the executive agency's needs, such property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the head of an executive agency under subsection (c)(7) of this section may not be delegated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Offer requests to potential sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency using procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property or services by reason of the application of subsection (c)(2) or (c)(6) of this section shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Justification for use of noncompetitive procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an executive agency may not award a contract using procedures other than competitive procedures unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the contracting officer for the contract justifies the use of such procedures in writing and certifies the accuracy and completeness of the justification;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:61 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the justification is approved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $500,000 (but equal to or less than $10,000,000), by the competition advocate for the procuring activity (without further delegation) or by an official referred to in clause (ii) or (iii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $10,000,000 (but equal to or less than $50,000,000), by the head of the procuring activity or a delegate who, if a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer or, if a civilian, is serving in a position in grade GS&ndash;16 or above under the General Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $50,000,000, by the senior procurement executive of the agency designated pursuant to section 414(3) of this title (without further delegation); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any required notice has been published with respect to such contract pursuant to section 416 of this title and all bids or proposals received in response to such notice have been considered by such executive agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(2), the justification and approval required by paragraph (1) may be made after the contract is awarded. The justification and approval required by paragraph (1) is not required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when a statute expressly requires that the procurement be made from a specified source;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(7) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of a procurement conducted under (i) the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46 et seq.), or (ii) section 637(a) of title 15.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The justification required by paragraph (1)(A) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description of the agency's needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an identification of the statutory exception from the requirement to use competitive procedures and a demonstration, based on the proposed contractor's qualifications or the nature of the procurement, of the reasons for using that exception;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a determination that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a description of the market survey conducted or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a listing of the sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the procurement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) a statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome a barrier to competition before a subsequent procurement for such needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The justification required by paragraph (1)(A) and any related information shall be made available for inspection by the public consistent with the provisions of section 552 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In no case may an executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enter into a contract for property or services using procedures other than competitive procedures on the basis of the lack of advance planning or concerns related to the amount of funds available to the agency for procurement functions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) procure property or services from another executive agency unless such other executive agency complies fully with the requirements of this subchapter in its procurement of such property or services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The restriction set out in clause (B) is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other restriction provided by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Simplified procedures for small purchases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to promote efficiency and economy in contracting and to avoid unnecessary burdens for agencies and contractors, the Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not greater than $5,000,000 with respect to which the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the property or services sought and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe regulations that provide special simplified procedures for acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property at rental rates that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the rental rate or rates under a multiyear lease do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold if the average annual amount of the rent payable for the period of the lease does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the simplified procedures required by paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In using the simplified procedures, an executive agency shall promote competition to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An executive agency shall comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions referred to in section 427(f) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Efficient implementation of requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall ensure that the requirement to obtain full and open competition is implemented in a manner that is consistent with the need to efficiently fulfill the Government's requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Merit-based award of contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is the policy of Congress that an executive agency should not be required by legislation to award a new contract to a specific non-Federal Government entity. It is further the policy of Congress that any program, project, or technology identified in legislation be procured through merit-based selection procedures.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:62 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) A provision of law may not be construed as requiring a new contract to be awarded to a specified non-Federal Government entity unless that provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specifically refers to this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) specifically identifies the particular non-Federal Government entity involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specifically states that the award to that entity is required by such provision of law in contravention of the policy set forth in paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, a contract is a new contract unless the work provided for in the contract is a continuation of the work performed by the specified entity under a preceding contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection shall not apply with respect to any contract that calls upon the National Academy of Sciences to investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to an executive agency and to report on such matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;253a. Planning and solicitation requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Preparation; planning; specifications in solicitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In preparing for the procurement of property or services, an executive agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify its needs and solicit bids or proposals in a manner designed to achieve full and open competition for the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) use advance procurement planning and market research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) develop specifications in such manner as is necessary to obtain full and open competition with due regard to the nature of the property or services to be acquired.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each solicitation under this subchapter shall include specifications which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consistent with the provisions of this subchapter, permit full and open competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the type of specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature of the needs of the executive agency and the market available to satisfy such needs. Subject to such needs, specifications may be stated in terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) function, so that a variety of products or services may qualify;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:64 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) performance, including specifications of the range of acceptable characteristics or of the minimum acceptable standards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) design requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents of solicitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the specifications described in subsection (a) of this section, each solicitation for sealed bids or competitive proposals (other than for a procurement for commercial items using special simplified procedures or a purchase for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold) shall at a minimum include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a statement of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all significant factors and significant subfactors which the executive agency reasonably expects to consider in evaluating sealed bids (including price) or competitive proposals (including cost or price, cost-related or price-related factors and subfactors, and noncost-related or nonprice-related factors and subfactors); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the relative importance assigned to each of those factors and subfactors; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) in the case of sealed bids&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a statement that sealed bids will be evaluated without discussions with the bidders; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the time and place for the opening of the sealed bids; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of competitive proposals&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) either a statement that the proposals are intended to be evaluated with, and award made after, discussions with the offerors, or a statement that the proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification) unless discussions are determined to be necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the time and place for submission of proposals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Evaluation factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each solicitation for competitive proposals, an executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall clearly establish the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors, including the quality of the product or services to be provided (including technical capability, management capability, prior experience, and past performance of the offeror);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall include cost or price to the Federal Government as an evaluation factor that must be considered in the evaluation of proposals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall disclose to offerors whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) significantly more important than cost or price;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) approximately equal in importance to cost or price; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) significantly less important than cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations implementing subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) may not define the terms &ldquo;significantly more important&rdquo; and &ldquo;significantly less important&rdquo; as specific numeric weights that would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of solicitations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional information in solicitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section prohibits an executive agency from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) providing additional information in a solicitation, including numeric weights for all evaluation factors and subfactors on a case-by-case basis; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) stating in a solicitation that award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation's mandatory requirements at the lowest cost or price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Evaluation of purchase options</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency, in issuing a solicitation for a contract to be awarded using sealed bid procedures, may not include in such solicitation a clause providing for the evaluation of prices for options to purchase additional property or services under the contract unless the executive agency has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;253b. Evaluation and award</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency shall evaluate sealed bids and competitive proposals, and award a contract, based solely on the factors specified in the solicitation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rejection of bids or proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All sealed bids or competitive proposals received in response to a solicitation may be rejected if the agency head determines that such action is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Opening of bids; promptness of award; written notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Sealed bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the solicitation. The executive agency shall evaluate the bids in accordance with subsection (a) of this section without discussions with the bidders and, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible source whose bid conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the United States, considering only price and the other price-related factors included in the solicitation. The award of a contract shall be made by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to the successful bidder. Within 3 days after the date of contract award, the executive agency shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, each bidder not awarded the contract that the contract has been awarded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Discussions with offerors; written notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An executive agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in accordance with subsection (a) of this section and may award a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after discussions with the offerors, provided that written or oral discussions have been conducted with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) based on the proposals received and without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification), if, as required by section 253a(b)(2)(B)(i) of this title, the solicitation included a statement that proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the contracting officer determines that the number of offerors that would otherwise be included in the competitive range under paragraph (1)(A) exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range, in accordance with the criteria specified in the solicitation, to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the offerors rated most highly in accordance with such criteria.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, the executive agency shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible source whose proposal is most advantageous to the United States, considering only cost or price and the other factors included in the solicitation. The executive agency shall award the contract by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to such source and, within 3 days after the date of contract award, shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, all other offerors of the rejection of their proposals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Post-award debriefings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When a contract is awarded by the head of an executive agency on the basis of competitive proposals, an unsuccessful offeror, upon written request received by the agency within 3 days after the date on which the unsuccessful offeror receives the notification of the contract award, shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract award. The executive agency shall debrief the offeror within, to the maximum extent practicable, 5 days after receipt of the request by the executive agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The debriefing shall include, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the executive agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the offeror's offer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the contractor awarded the contract and the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the debriefed offeror;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the overall ranking of all offers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a summary of the rationale for the award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) in the case of a proposal that includes a commercial item that is an end item under the contract, the make and model of the item being provided in accordance with the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the executive agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The debriefing may not include point-by-point comparisons of the debriefed offeror's offer with other offers and may not disclose any information that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each solicitation for competitive proposals shall include a statement that information described in paragraph (2) may be disclosed in post-award debriefings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, within one year after the date of the contract award and as a result of a successful procurement protest, the executive agency seeks <!-- PDFPage:66 -->to fulfill the requirement under the protested contract either on the basis of a new solicitation of offers or on the basis of new best and final offers requested for that contract, the head of such executive agency shall make available to all offerors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the information provided in debriefings under this subsection regarding the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the same information that would have been provided to the original offerors.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure effective and efficient expenditure of public funds and fair and expeditious resolution of protests to the award of Federal procurement contracts, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. Heads of executive departments and agencies (&ldquo;agencies&rdquo;) engaged in the procurement of supplies and services shall prescribe administrative procedures for the resolution of protests to the award of their procurement contracts as an alternative to protests in fora outside the procuring agencies. Procedures prescribed pursuant to this order shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) emphasize that whenever conduct of a procurement is contested, all parties should use their best efforts to resolve the matter with agency contracting officers;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) to the maximum extent practicable, provide for inexpensive, informal, procedurally simple, and expeditious resolution of protests, including, where appropriate and as permitted by law, the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques, third party neutrals, and another agency's personnel;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) allow actual or prospective bidders or offerors whose direct economic interests would be affected by the award or failure to award the contract to request a review, at a level above the contracting officer, of any decision by a contracting officer that is alleged to have violated a statute or regulation and, thereby, caused prejudice to the protester; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) except where immediate contract award or performance is justified for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined to be in the best interest of the United States, prohibit award or performance of the contract while a timely filed protest is pending before the agency. To allow for the withholding of a contract award or performance, the agency must have received notice of the protest within either 10 calendar days after the contract award or 5 calendar days after the bidder or offeror who is protesting the contract award was given the opportunity to be debriefed by the agency, whichever date is later.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall: (a) work with the heads of executive agencies to provide policy guidance and leadership necessary to implement provisions of this order; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Qualification requirement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, &ldquo;qualification requirement&rdquo; means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agency head; functions; prior to enforcement of qualification requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the head of the agency shall, before enforcing any qualification requirement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror upon request all requirements which a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy in order to become qualified, such requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specify an estimate of the costs of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror in order to become qualified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, upon request, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate at its own expense (except as provided in subsection (d) of this section) its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned or of another agency obtained through interagency agreement, or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of clause (4), provide to the extent possible that such services be provided by a contractor who is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources and who shall be required in such contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:69 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event qualification is not attained, is promptly furnished specific information why qualification was not attained.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicability; waiver authority; referral of offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply with respect to a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement. After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (b) of this section for up to two years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The waiver authority contained in paragraph (2) shall not apply with respect to any qualified products list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement, if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified for award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 637(b)(7) of title 15 if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement in order to comply with subsection (b) of this section or in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Number; qualified sources or products; fewer than two actual manufacturers; functions of agency head</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than two actual manufacturers or the products of two actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) periodically publish notice in the Commerce Business Daily soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise national security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement, but such costs may be borne only if the head of the agency determines that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to offset (within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements) the costs incurred by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify as to its status as a small business concern under section 632 of title 15.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Examination; need for qualification requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within seven years after the establishment of a qualification requirement, the need for such qualification requirement shall be examined and the standards of such requirement revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. The preceding sentence does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enforcement determination by agency head</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, whenever the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not thereafter enforce that qualification requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;253d. Validation of proprietary data restrictions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contracts; delivery of technical services; contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A contract for property or services entered into by an executive agency which provides for the delivery of technical data, shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a contractor or subcontractor at any tier shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer a written justification for any restric<!-- PDFPage:70 -->tion asserted by the contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States to use such technical data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the contracting officer may review the validity of any restriction asserted by the contractor or by a subcontractor under the contract on the right of the United States to use technical data furnished to the United States under the contract if the contracting officer determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction and that the continued adherence to the asserted restriction by the United States would make it impracticable to procure the item competitively at a later time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review; challenge; notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If after such review the contracting officer determines that a challenge to the asserted restriction is warranted, the contracting officer shall provide written notice to the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction. Such notice shall state&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the grounds for challenging the asserted restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement for a response within 60 days justifying the current validity of the asserted restriction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Written request; additional time; schedule of responses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a restriction subject to this section submits to the contracting officer a written request, showing the need for additional time to comply with the requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted restriction, additional time to adequately permit the submission of such justification shall be provided by the contracting officer as appropriate. If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the first in time challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each such challenge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Decision; validity of asserted restriction; failure to submit response</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to submit any response under subsection (b) of this section, the contracting officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a justification is submitted in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a contracting officer shall within 60 days of receipt of any justification submitted, issue a decision or notify the party asserting the restriction of the time within which a decision will be issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Claim; considered claim within Contract Disputes Act of 1978</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier, such claim shall be considered a claim within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Challenge; use of technical data; sustained; liability of United States for costs and fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the United States to use such technical data is sustained&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the restriction on the right of the United States to use the technical data shall be cancelled; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the United States for payment of the cost to the United States of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the United States in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the United States to use such technical data is not sustained&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the United States shall continue to be bound by the restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the United States shall be liable for payment to the party asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction if the challenge by the United States is found not to be made in good faith.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The notice required by section 416 of this title and section 637(e) of title 15 shall reasonably and fairly describe the general scope, magnitude, and duration of the proposed task order contract in a manner that would reasonably enable a potential offeror to decide whether to request the solicitation and consider submitting an offer.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Issuance of orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following actions are not required for issuance of a task or delivery order under a task or delivery order contract:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A separate notice for such order under section 416 of this title or section 637(e) of title 15.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a competition (or a waiver of competition approved in accordance with section 253(f) of this title) that is separate from that used for entering into the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Multiple award contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When multiple contracts are awarded under section 253h(d)(1)(B) or 253i(e) of this title, all contractors awarded such contracts shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered, pursuant to procedures set forth in the contracts, for each task or delivery order in excess of $2,500 that is to be issued under any of the contracts unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the executive agency's need for the services or property ordered is of such unusual urgency that providing such opportunity to all such contractors would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling that need;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) only one such contractor is capable of providing the services or property required at the level of quality required because the services or property ordered are unique or highly specialized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already issued on a competitive basis; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it is necessary to place the order with a particular contractor in order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Statement of work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A task or delivery order shall include a statement of work that clearly specifies all tasks to be performed or property to be delivered under the order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Protests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order except for a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or <!-- PDFPage:74 -->maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Task and delivery order ombudsman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The head of each executive agency who awards multiple task or delivery order contracts pursuant to section 253h(d)(1)(B) or 253i(e) of this title shall appoint or designate a task and delivery order ombudsman who shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors on such contracts and ensuring that all of the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task or delivery orders when required under subsection (b) of this section. The task and delivery order ombudsman shall be a senior agency official who is independent of the contracting officer for the contracts and may be the executive agency's competition advocate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under the Brooks Architect-Engineers Act (title IX of this Act) [40 U.S.C. 541 et seq.] is used or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an executive agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) of this section that the procedures are appropriate for use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria for use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when the contracting officer anticipates that three or more offers will be received for such contract, design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for such contract, the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer, and the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The time constraints for delivery of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The capability and experience of potential contractors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Other criteria established by the agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Government's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals which meet the Government's needs. If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineers Act (40 U.S.C. 541 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include information on the offeror's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) technical approach; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical qualifications; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) do not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) detailed design information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) cost or price information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team) and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information. Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work (or both), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 253a of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The agency awards the contract in accordance with section 253b of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Solicitation to state number of offerors to be selected for phase-two requests for competitive proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) of this section shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section. The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Requirement for guidance and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) of this section are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting contractors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contracts awarded using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, contracts awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures may be of any type which in the opinion of the agency head will promote the best interests of the Government. Every contract awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures shall contain a suitable warranty, as determined by the agency head, by the contractor that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure such contract upon an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, excepting bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the contractor for the purpose of securing business, for the breach or violation of which warranty the Government shall have the right to annul such contract without liability or in its discretion to deduct from the contract price or consideration the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee. The preceding sentence does not apply to a contract for an amount that is not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold or to a contract for the acquisition of commercial items.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Barred contracts; fee limitation; determination of use; advance notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting shall not be used, and in the case of a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract the fee shall not exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost of the contract, exclusive of the fee, as determined by the agency head at the time of entering into such contract (except that a fee not in excess of 15 percent of such estimated cost is authorized in any such contract for experimental, developmental, or research work and that a fee inclusive of the contractor's costs and not in excess of 6 percent of the estimated cost, exclusive of fees, as determined by the agency head at the time of entering into the contract, of the project to which such fee is applicable is authorized in contracts for architectural or engineering services relating to any public works or utility project). All cost and cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contracts shall provide for advance notification by the contractor to the procuring agency of any subcontract thereunder on a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee basis and of any fixed-price subcontract or purchase order which exceeds in dollar amount either the simplified acquisition threshold or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the prime contract; and a procuring agency, through any authorized representative thereof, shall have the right to inspect the plans and to audit the books and records of any prime contractor or subcontractor engaged in the performance of a cost or cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person required, as an offeror, contractor, or subcontractor, to submit cost or pricing data under paragraph (1) (or required by the head of the procuring activity concerned to submit such data under subsection (c) of this section) shall be required to certify that, to the <!-- PDFPage:78 -->best of the person's knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data submitted are accurate, complete, and current.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Cost or pricing data required to be submitted under paragraph (1) (or under subsection (c) of this section), and a certification required to be submitted under paragraph (2), shall be submitted&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) A waiver of requirements for submission of certified cost or pricing data that is granted under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section in the case of a contract or subcontract does not waive the requirement under paragraph (1)(C) for submission of cost or pricing data in the case of subcontracts under that contract or subcontract unless the head of the procuring activity granting the waiver determines that the requirement under that paragraph should be waived in the case of such subcontracts and justifies in writing the reasons for the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Upon the request of a contractor that was required to submit cost or pricing data under paragraph (1) in connection with a prime contract entered into on or before October 13, 1994, the head of the executive agency that entered into such contract shall modify the contract to reflect subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (C)(ii) of paragraph (1).

In the case of an amount that is evenly divisible by $25,000 but not evenly divisible by $50,000, the amount shall be rounded to the next higher multiple of $50,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section in the case of a contract, a subcontract, or a modification of a contract or subcontract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for which the price agreed upon is based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) adequate price competition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prices set by law or regulation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the acquisition of a commercial item; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Modifications of contracts and subcontracts for commercial items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a modification of a contract or subcontract for a commercial item that is not covered by the exception to the submission of certified cost or pricing data in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B), submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contract or subcontract being modified is a contract or subcontract for which submission of certified cost or pricing data may not be required by reason of paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the modification would not change the contract or subcontract, as the case may be, from a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of an item other than a commercial item.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cost or pricing data on below-threshold contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to require submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), when certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted by subsection (a) of this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, such data may nevertheless be required to be submitted by the head of the procuring activity, but only if the head of the procuring activity determines that such data are necessary for the evaluation by the agency of the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract. In any case in which the head of the procuring activity requires such data to be submitted under this subsection, the head of the procuring activity shall justify in writing the reason for such requirement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The head of the procuring activity may not require certified cost or pricing data to be submitted under this paragraph for any contract or subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, covered by the exceptions in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Delegation of authority prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The head of a procuring activity may not delegate the functions under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Submission of other information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to require submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted under this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, the contracting officer shall require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract. Except in the case of a contract or subcontract covered by the exceptions in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the contracting officer shall require that the data submitted include, at a minimum, appropriate information on the <!-- PDFPage:79 -->prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for the procurement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations on authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include the following provisions regarding the types of information that contracting officers may require under paragraph (1):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Reasonable limitations on requests for sales data relating to commercial items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A requirement that a contracting officer limit, to the maximum extent practicable, the scope of any request for information relating to commercial items from an offeror to only that information that is in the form regularly maintained by the offeror in commercial operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A statement that any information received relating to commercial items that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5 shall not be disclosed by the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under subsection (a)(2) of this section is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that such price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or pricing data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it shall be a defense that the United States did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the United States about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section before such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable under paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Interest and penalties for certain overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract with an executive agency subject to this section and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for interest on the amount of such overpayment, to be computed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of such overpayment to the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of title 26; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the submission of such defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional <!-- PDFPage:80 -->amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any liability under this subsection of a contractor that submits cost or pricing data but refuses to submit the certification required by subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data shall not be affected by the refusal to submit such certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Right of United States to examine contractor records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and currency of cost or pricing data required to be submitted by this section, an executive agency shall have the authority provided by section 254d(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cost or pricing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;cost or pricing data&rdquo; means all facts that, as of the date of agreement on the price of a contract (or the price of a contract modification) or, if applicable consistent with subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section, another date agreed upon between the parties, a prudent buyer or seller would reasonably expect to affect price negotiations significantly. Such term does not include information that is judgmental, but does include the factual information from which a judgment was derived.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Subcontract</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency may enter into a multiyear contract for the acquisition of property or services if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funds are available and obligated for such contract, for the full period of the contract or for the first fiscal year in which the contract is in effect, and for the estimated costs associated with any necessary termination of such contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need for the property or services is reasonably firm and continuing over the period of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a multiyear contract will serve the best interests of the United States by encouraging full and open competition or promoting economy in administration, performance, and operation of the agency's programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Termination clause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A multiyear contract entered into under the authority of this section shall include a clause that provides that the contract shall be terminated if funds are not made available for the continuation of such contract in any fiscal year covered by the contract. Amounts available for paying termination costs shall remain available for such purpose until the costs associated with termination of the contract are paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cancellation ceiling notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before any contract described in subsection (a) of this section that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $10,000,000 may be awarded, the executive agency shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the Congress, and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Multiyear contract defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations are not made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rule of construction</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive agency, acting through an authorized representative, is authorized, for the purpose of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and currency of certified cost or pricing data required to be submitted pursuant to section 254b of this title with respect to a contract or subcontract, to examine all records of the contractor or subcontractor related to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subpoena power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Inspector General of an executive agency appointed under section 3 or 8G&nbsp;<sup><a href="#254d_1_target" name="254d_1">1</a></sup> of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) or, upon request of the head of an executive agency, the Director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency (or any successor agency) of the Department of Defense or the Inspector General of the General Services Administration may require by subpoena the production of records of a contractor, access to which is provided for that executive agency by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Comptroller General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), each contract awarded after using procedures other than sealed bid procedures shall provide that the Comptroller General and his representatives are authorized to examine any records of the contractor, or any of its subcontractors, that directly pertain to, and involve transactions relating to, the contract or subcontract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a contract or subcontract with a foreign contractor or foreign subcontractor if the executive agency concerned determines, with the concurrence of the Comptroller General or his designee, that the application of that paragraph to the contract or subcontract would not be in the public interest. However, the concurrence of the Comptroller General or his designee is not required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) where the contractor or subcontractor is a foreign government or agency thereof or is precluded by the laws of the country involved from making its records available for examination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) where the executive agency determines, after taking into account the price and availability of the property and services from United States sources, that the public interest would be best served by not applying paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payment authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any executive agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make advance, partial, progress or other payments under contracts for property or services made by the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) insert in solicitations for procurement of property or services a provision limiting to small business concerns advance or progress payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Performance-based payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever practicable, payments under subsection (a) of this section shall be made on any of the following bases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Performance measured by objective, quantifiable methods such as delivery of acceptable items, work measurement, or statistical process controls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Accomplishment of events defined in the program management plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Other quantifiable measures of results.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments made under subsection (a) of this section may not exceed the unpaid contract price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Security for advance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Advance payments under subsection (a) of this section may be made only upon adequate security and a determination by the agency head that to do so would be in the public interest. Such security may be in the form of a lien in favor of the Government on the property contracted for, on the balance in an account in which such payments are deposited, and on such of the property acquired for performance of the contract as the parties may agree. This lien shall be paramount to all other liens and is effective immediately upon the first advancement of funds without filing, notice, or any other action by the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Conditions for progress payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The executive agency shall ensure that any payment for work in progress (including materials, labor, and other items) under a contract of an executive agency that provides for such payments is commensurate with the work accomplished that meets standards established under the contract. The contractor shall provide such information and evidence as the executive agency determines necessary to permit the executive agency to carry out the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The executive agency shall ensure that progress payments referred to in paragraph (1) are not made for more than 80 percent of the work accomplished under the contract so long as the executive agency has not made the contractual terms, specifications, and price definite.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection applies to any contract in an amount greater than $25,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive agency receiving a recommendation under paragraph (1) in the case of a contractor's request for payment under a contract shall determine whether there is substantial evidence that the request is based on fraud. Upon making such a determination, the head of the executive agency may reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor under such contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The extent of any reduction or suspension of payments by an executive agency under paragraph (2) on the basis of fraud shall be reasonably commensurate with the anticipated loss to the United States resulting from the fraud.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A written justification for each decision of the head of an executive agency whether to reduce or suspend payments under paragraph (2), and for each recommendation received by the executive agency in connection with such deci<!-- PDFPage:84 -->sion, shall be prepared and be retained in the files of the executive agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of each executive agency shall prescribe procedures to ensure that, before the head of the executive agency decides to reduce or suspend payments in the case of a contractor under paragraph (2), the contractor is afforded notice of the proposed reduction or suspension and an opportunity to submit matters to the executive agency in response to such proposed reduction or suspension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Not later than 180 days after the date on which the head of an executive agency reduces or suspends payments to a contractor under paragraph (2), the remedy coordination official of the executive agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) review the determination of fraud on which the reduction or suspension is based; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) transmit a recommendation to the head of such executive agency whether the suspension or reduction should continue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The head of each executive agency who receives recommendations made by a remedy coordination official of the executive agency to reduce or suspend payments under paragraph (2) during a fiscal year shall prepare for such year a report that contains the recommendations, the actions taken on the recommendations and the reasons for such actions, and an assessment of the effects of such actions on the Federal Government. Any such report shall be available to any Member of Congress upon request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The head of an executive agency may not delegate responsibilities under this subsection to any person in a position below level IV of the Executive Schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;remedy coordination official&rdquo;, with respect to an executive agency, means the person or entity in that executive agency who coordinates within that executive agency the administration of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies resulting from investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Indirect cost that violates FAR cost principle</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency shall require that a covered contract provide that if the contractor submits to the executive agency a proposal for settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any period after such costs have been accrued and if that proposal includes the submission of a cost which is unallowable because <!-- PDFPage:85 -->the cost violates a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (referred to in section 421(c)(1) of this title) or an executive agency supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the cost shall be disallowed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Penalty for violation of cost principle</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the executive agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) of this section that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the executive agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the executive agency determines that a proposal for settlement of indirect costs submitted by a contractor includes a cost determined to be unallowable in the case of such contractor before the submission of such proposal, the executive agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to two times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) of this section to be waived in the case of a contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs when&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is insignificant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer's satisfaction, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it has established appropriate policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the proposal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability of contract disputes procedure to disallowance of cost and assessment of penalty</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of a proceeding referred to in paragraph (1) that is commenced by a State, the executive agency that awarded the covered contract involved in the proceeding may allow the costs incurred by the contractor in connection with such proceeding as reimbursable costs if the executive agency determines, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the costs were incurred as a result of (A) a specific term or condition of the contract, or (B) specific written instructions of the executive agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), costs incurred by a contractor in connection with a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding commenced by the United States or a State in connection with a covered contract may be allowed as reimbursable costs under the contract if such costs are not disallowable under paragraph (1), but only to the extent provided in subparagraph (B).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition of reprisals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An employee of a contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a Member of Congress or an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice information relating to a substantial violation of law related to a contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigation of complaints</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person who believes that the person has been subjected to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) of this section may submit a complaint to the Inspector General of the executive agency. Unless the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous, the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, upon completion of such investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the person, the contractor concerned, and the head of the agency. In the case of an executive agency that does not have an Inspector General, the duties of the Inspector General under this section shall be performed by an official designated by the head of the executive agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Remedy and enforcement authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the head of an executive agency determines that a contractor has subjected a person to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) of this section, the head of the executive agency may take one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with the compensation (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees and expert witnesses&rsquo; fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the executive agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the executive agency shall file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and compensatory and exemplary damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain review of the order's conformance with this subsection, and any regulations issued to carry out this section, in the United States court of appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the discharge of, demotion of, or discrimination against an employee for a disclosure other than a disclosure protected by subsection (a) of this section or to modify or derogate from a right or remedy otherwise available to the employee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;contract&rdquo; means a contract awarded by the head of an executive agency.</p>
