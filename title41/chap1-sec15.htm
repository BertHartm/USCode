<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No contract or order, or any interest therein, shall be transferred by the party to whom such contract or order is given to any other party, and any such transfer shall cause the annulment of the contract or order transferred, so far as the United States is concerned. All rights of action, however, for any breach of such contract by the contracting parties, are reserved to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assignment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply in any case in which the moneys due or to become due from the United States or from any agency or department thereof, under a contract providing for payments aggregating $1,000 or more, are assigned to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency, provided:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) That, in the case of any contract entered into after October 9, 1940, no claim shall be assigned if it arises under a contract which forbids such assignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) That, unless otherwise expressly permitted by such contract, any such assignment shall cover all amounts payable under such contract and not already paid, shall not be made to more than one party, and shall not be subject to further assignment, except that any such assignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more parties participating in such financing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That, in the event of any such assignment, the assignee thereof shall file written notice of the assignment together with a true copy of the instrument of the assignment with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contracting officer or the head of his department or agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the surety or sureties upon the bond or bonds, if any, in connection with such contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the disbursing officer, if any, designated in such contract to make payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Validity of assignment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any law to the contrary governing the validity of assignments, any assignment pursuant to this section shall constitute a valid assignment for all purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignee liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which moneys due or to become due under any contract are or have been assigned pursuant to this section, no liability of any nature of the assignor to the United States or any department or agency thereof, whether arising from or independently of such contract, shall create or impose any liability on the part of the assignee to make restitution, refund, or repayment to the United States of any amount heretofore since July 1, 1950, or hereafter received under the assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amendment of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy, or any other department or agency of the United States designated by the President, except any such contract under which full payment has been made, may, upon a determination of need by the President, provide or be amended without consideration to provide that payments to be made to the assignee of any moneys due or to become due under such contract shall not be subject to reduction or setoff. Each such determination of need shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Assignor liability arising independent of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a provision described in subsection (e) of this section or a provision to the same general effect has been at any time heretofore or is hereafter included or inserted in any such contract, payments to be made thereafter to an assignee of any moneys due or to become due under such contract shall not be subject to reduction or setoff for any liability of any nature of the assignor to the United States or any department or agency thereof which arises independently of such contract, or hereafter for any liability of the assignor on account of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) renegotiation under any renegotiation statute or under any statutory renegotiation article in the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) fines;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:14 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) penalties (which term does not include amounts which may be collected or withheld from the assignor in accordance with or for failure to comply with the terms of the contract); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) taxes, social security contributions, or the withholding or non withholding of taxes or social security contributions, whether arising from or independently of such contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Accrued rights and obligations</h4>
