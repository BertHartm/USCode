<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each solicitation for competitive proposals shall include a statement that information described in paragraph (2) may be disclosed in post-award debriefings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the information provided in debriefings under this subsection regarding the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which the United States will be able to acquire competitively in the future.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a production contract are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the United States will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to such requirement may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Proposals to provide to the United States the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the United States, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Protest file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the case of a solicitation for a contract issued by, or an award or proposed award of a contract by, the head of an executive agency, a protest is filed pursuant to the procedures in subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 31, and an actual or prospective offeror so requests, a file of the protest shall be established by the procuring activity and reasonable access shall be provided to actual or prospective offerors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Information exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5 may be redacted in a file established pursuant to paragraph (1) unless an applicable protective order provides otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations implementing this subsection shall be consistent with the regulations regarding the preparation and submission of an agency's protest file (the so-called &ldquo;rule 4 file&rdquo;) for protests to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals under section 759 of title 40.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Agency actions on protests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in connection with a protest, the head of an executive agency determines that a solicitation, proposed award, or award does not comply with the requirements of law or regulation, the head of such executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may take any action set out in subparagraphs (A) through (F) of subsection (b)(1) of section 3554 of title 31; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may pay costs described in paragraph (1) of section 3554(c) of such title within the limits referred to in paragraph (2) of such section.</p>
