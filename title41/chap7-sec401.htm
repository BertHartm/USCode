<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12969. Federal Acquisition and Community Right-To-Know</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12969, Aug. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 40989, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11001&ndash;11050) (&ldquo;EPCRA&rdquo;) and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101&ndash;13109) (&ldquo;PPA&rdquo;) established programs to protect public health and the environment by providing the public with important information on the toxic chemicals being released into the air, land, and water in their communities by manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Toxics Release Inventory (&ldquo;TRI&rdquo;) established pursuant to section 313(j) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(j), based on information required to be reported under section 313 of EPCRA and section 6607 of PPA, 42 U.S.C. 13106, provides the public, industry, and Federal, State, and local governments with a basic tool for making risk-based decisions about management and control of toxic chemicals, that can have significant adverse effects on human health and the environment. TRI data allow the public, industry, and government to gauge the progress of industry and government efforts to reduce toxic chemical wastes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sharing vital TRI information with the public has provided a strong incentive for reduction in the generation, and, ultimately, release into the environment, of toxic chemicals. Since the inception of the TRI program, reported releases to the environment under TRI have decreased significantly.</p>
<p class="note-body">The efficiency of the Federal Government is served when it purchases high quality supplies and services that have been produced with a minimum impact on the public health and environment of communities surrounding government contractors. Savings associated with reduced raw materials usage, reduced use of costly, inefficient end-of-pipeline pollution controls, and reduced liability and remediation costs from worker and community claims all serve to increase the economic and efficient provision of essential supplies and services to the government. As a result of TRI reporting, many manufacturers have learned of previously unrecognized significant efficiencies and cost savings in their production processes.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government's receipt of timely and quality supplies and services is also served by the general enhancement of relations between government contractors and the communities in which they are situated, as well as the cooperative working relationship between employers and employees who may be subject to exposure to toxic materials.</p>
<p class="note-body">Information concerning chemical release and transfer can assist the government to purchase efficiently produced, lower cost, and higher quality supplies and services that also have a minimum adverse impact on community health and the environment.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to promote economy and efficiency in government procurement of supplies and services, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11001 et seq., PPA, 42 U.S.C. 13101 et seq., 40 U.S.C. 471 and 486(a), and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring supplies and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient procurement of Federal Government contracts, Federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable, shall contract with companies that report in a public manner on toxic chemicals released to the environment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. 2&ndash;201. All definitions found in EPCRA and PPA and implementing regulations are incorporated into this order by reference, with the following exceptions for purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;202. &ldquo;<em>Federal agency</em>&rdquo; means an &ldquo;Executive agency,&rdquo; as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. For purposes of this order, military departments, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, are covered under the auspices of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;203. &ldquo;<em>Acquisition</em>&rdquo; means the acquiring by contract with appropriated funds of supplies or services (including construction) by and for the use of the Federal Government through purchase or lease, whether the supplies or services are already in existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated. Acquisition begins at the point when the Federal department or agency needs are established and includes the description of requirements to satisfy agency needs, solicitation and selection of sources, award of contracts, contract financing, contract performance, contract administration, and those technical and management functions directly related to the process of fulfilling agency needs by contract.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;204. &ldquo;<em>Toxic chemical</em>&rdquo; means a substance on the list described in section 313(c) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(c), as it exists on the effective date of this order.</p>

<p class="note-body">3&ndash;302.

<p class="note-body">3&ndash;303. Each Federal agency shall find that a prospective Federal contractor has satisfied the requirement in subsection 3&ndash;301 if the contractor certifies in a solicitation that it:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(a) Does not manufacture, process, or otherwise use any toxic chemicals listed under section 313(c) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(c);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(b) Does not have 10 or more full-time employees as specified in section 313(b)(1)(A) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(b)(1)(A);</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(d) Has complied fully with the reporting requirements of subsection 4&ndash;404.</p>
<p class="note-body">3&ndash;304. Each Federal agency shall require the filings described in subsection 3&ndash;301 above to include information on all chemicals identified by the Administrator pursuant to section 313(c) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(c), as of the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">3&ndash;305. Each Federal agency may amend existing contracts, to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, to require the reporting of information specified in subsection 3&ndash;301 above.</p>
<p class="note-body">3&ndash;306. As consistent with Title IV of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA), Public Law 103&ndash;355 [see Tables for classification], and section 4(11) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 403(11), the requirements of this order are only applicable to competitive acquisition contracts expected to equal or exceed $100,000.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Implementation</em>. 4&ndash;401. Not later than September 30, 1995, the EPA shall publish in the Federal Register guidance for compliance with this order, including applicability with respect to subcontractors.</p>
<p class="note-body">4&ndash;402. Within 30 days of the issuance of the guidance provided for in subsection 4&ndash;401 above, each Federal agency shall include in all acquisition solicitations issued on or after the effective date of this order, the provisions necessary to effect this order.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Streamlining Procurement Through Electronic Commerce</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993, 58 F.R. 58095, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods and services. Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity. Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-effectiveness. The electronic exchange of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult under the current system. For these reasons, I am committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>1. OBJECTIVES.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) exchange procurement information&mdash;such as solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual documents&mdash;electronically between the private sector and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement opportunities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and access Federal procurement data.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>2. IMPLEMENTATION.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">The President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch through the following actions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive departments or agencies respon<!-- PDFPage:106 -->sible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide implementation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department or agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective department or agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) assist the President's Management Council in implementing the electronic commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance with the schedules established herein; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) designate one or more senior level employees to assist the President's Management Council and serve as a point of contact for the development and implementation of the Federal electronic commerce system within each respective department or agency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>3. NO PRIVATE RIGHTS CREATED.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
