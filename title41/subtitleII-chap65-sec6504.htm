<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;or firms&rdquo; are omitted because of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 41:41, restated in section 6501 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;or violated&rdquo; are added for consistency in the chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;contract described in section 6502 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;contracts&rdquo; to clarify the scope of the prohibition. The words &ldquo;the date of the determination by the Secretary that a breach or violation occurred&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the date the Secretary of Labor determines such breach to have occurred&rdquo; to clarify that the three-year period begins with the date of the Secretary's determination and not with the date of the breach or violation. The words &ldquo;or violation&rdquo; are added for consistency in the chapter.</p>
