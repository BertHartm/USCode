<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Certification of Claims.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Requirement generally</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For claims of more than $100,000 made by a contractor, the contractor shall certify that&mdash;</p>

A defect in the certification of a claim does not deprive a court or an agency board of jurisdiction over the claim. Prior to the entry of a final judgment by a court or a decision by an agency board, the court or agency board shall require a defective certification to be corrected.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Fraudulent Claims.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Liability of contractor</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a contractor is unable to support any part of the contractor's claim and it is determined that the inability is attributable to a misrepresentation of fact or fraud by the contractor, then the contractor is liable to the Federal Government for an amount equal to the unsupported part of the claim plus all of the Federal Government's costs attributable to reviewing the unsupported part of the claim. Liability under this paragraph shall be determined within 6 years of the commission of the misrepresentation of fact or fraud.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Contents of Decision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer's decision shall state the reasons for the decision reached and shall inform the contractor of the contractor's rights as provided in this chapter.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Failure to issue decision within required time period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Failure by a contracting officer to issue a decision on a claim within the required time period is deemed to be a decision by the contracting officer denying the claim and authorizes an appeal or action on the claim as otherwise provided in this chapter. However, the tribunal concerned may, at its option, stay the proceedings of the appeal or action to obtain a decision by the contracting officer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Finality of Decision Unless Appealed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer's decision on a claim is final and conclusive and is not subject to review by any forum, tribunal, or Federal Government agency, unless an appeal or action is timely commenced as authorized by this chapter. This chapter does not prohibit an executive agency from including a clause in a Federal Government contract requiring that, pending final decision of an appeal, action, or final settlement, a contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of the contract in accordance with the contracting officer's decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Contractor</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contractor that rejects an agency's request for alternative dispute resolution proceedings shall inform the agency in writing of the contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the request.</p>

Section 2(a)(3) of the Act of July 1, 1971 (Pub.

However, the Renegotiation Act of 1951 (Mar. 23, 1951, ch. 15, 65 Stat. 7) was omitted from the Code pursuant to section 102(c)(1) of the Act (65 Stat. 8), amended several times, the last being Public Law 94&ndash;185 (89 Stat. 1061), which provided that most provisions of that Act do not apply to receipts and accruals attributable to contract performance after September 30, 1976, and in view of the termination of the Renegotiation Board and the transfer of property and records of the Board to the Administrator of the General Services Administration on March 31, 1979, pursuant to Public Law 95&ndash;431 (92 Stat. 1043). Although the Renegotiation Board is no longer in existence, Federal agencies, including the General Services Administration, are required to use interest rates that are computed under the criteria set out in this subsection. See 31:3902(a) and the website of the Bureau of the Public Debt, available at http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdprmt2.htm. For an example of publication of rates under the criteria enacted here, see Federal Register, volume 67, number 247, page 78566, December 24, 2002.</p>
