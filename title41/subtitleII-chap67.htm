<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13495. Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13495, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 6103, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">When a service contract expires, and a follow-on contract is awarded for the same service, at the same location, the successor contractor or its subcontractors often hires the majority of the predecessor's employees. On some occasions, however, a successor contractor or its subcontractors hires a new work force, thus displacing the predecessor's employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are served when the successor contractor hires the predecessor's employees. A carryover work force reduces disruption to the delivery of services during the period of transition between contractors and provides the Federal Government the benefits of an experienced and trained work force that is familiar with the Federal Government's personnel, facilities, and requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq</em>., and in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. It is the policy of the Federal Government that service contracts and solicitations for such contracts shall include a clause that requires the contractor, and its subcontractors, under a contract that succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services at the same location, to offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. There shall be no employment openings under the contract until such right of first refusal has been provided. Nothing in this order shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive Order or law of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Service contract&rdquo; or &ldquo;contract&rdquo; means any contract or subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or its contractors that is covered by the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 351 <em>et seq</em>., and its implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Employee&rdquo; means a service employee as defined in the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. 357(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Exclusions</em>. This order shall not apply to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) contracts or subcontracts under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in 41 U.S.C. 403;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) contracts or subcontracts awarded pursuant to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 46&ndash;48c;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodial services provided to the Federal Government under contracts or subcontracts with sheltered workshops employing the severely handicapped as described in section 505 of the Treasury, Postal Services [sic] and General Government Appropriations Act, 1995, Public Law 103&ndash;329;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) agreements for vending facilities entered into pursuant to the preference regulations issued under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:119 --><p class="note-body">(e) employees who were hired to work under a Federal service contract and one or more nonfederal service contracts as part of a single job, provided that the employees were not deployed in a manner that was designed to avoid the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Authority to Exempt Contracts</em>. If the head of a contracting department or agency finds that the application of any of the requirements of this order would not serve the purposes of this order or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services on an economical and efficient basis, the head of such department or agency may exempt its department or agency from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of this order with respect to a particular contract, subcontract, or purchase order or any class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Contract Clause</em>. The following contract clause shall be included in solicitations for and service contracts that succeed contracts for performance of the same or similar work at the same location:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;NONDISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, the contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which employees are qualified. The contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. Except as provided in paragraph (b) there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. The contractor and its subcontractors shall make an express offer of employment to each employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (a) above, the contractor and any subcontractors (1) may employ under this contract any employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least 3 months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (2) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 357(b), and (3) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222&ndash;41(n), the contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. The Contracting Officer will provide the list to the successor contractor, and the list shall be provided on request to employees or their representatives.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the contractor or its subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order (No.) &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; [13495], the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) In every subcontract entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the contractor will include provisions that ensure that each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b) with respect to the employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor contractor and its subcontractors. The subcontract shall also include provisions to ensure that the subcontractor will provide the contractor with the information about the employees of the subcontractor needed by the contractor to comply with paragraph 5(c), above. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: provided, however, that if the contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the contractor may request that the United States enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Enforcement</em>. (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) is responsible for investigating and obtaining compliance with this order. In such proceedings, the Secretary shall have the authority to issue final orders prescribing appropriate sanctions and remedies, including, but not limited to, orders requiring employment and payment of wages lost. The Secretary also may provide that where a contractor or subcontractor has failed to comply with any order of the Secretary or has committed willful violations of this order or the regulations issued pursuant thereto, the contractor or subcontractor, and its responsible officers, and any firm in which the contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest, shall be ineligible to be awarded any contract of the United States for a period of up to 3 years. Neither an order for debarment of any contractor or subcontractor from further Government contracts under this section nor the inclusion of a contractor or subcontractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors shall be carried out without affording the contractor or subcontractor an opportunity for a hearing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Liability of Responsible Party</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A party responsible for a violation of a contract provision required under section 6703(1) or (2) of this title or a violation of section 6704 of this title is liable for an amount equal to the sum of any deduction, rebate, refund, or underpayment of compensation due any employee engaged in the performance of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Recovery of Amounts Underpaid to Employees.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Withholding accrued payments due on contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The total amount determined under subsection (a) to be due any employee engaged in the performance of a contract may be withheld from accrued payments due on the contract or on any other contract between the same contractor and the Federal Government. The amount withheld shall be held in a deposit fund. On order of the Secretary, the compensation found by the Secretary or the head of a Federal agency to be due an underpaid employee pursuant to this chapter shall be paid from the deposit fund directly to the underpaid employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Bringing actions against contractors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse a service employee with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the compensation required pursuant to this chapter, the Federal Government may bring action against the contractor, subcontractor, or any sureties in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the remaining amount of underpayment. Any amount recovered shall be held in the deposit fund and shall be paid, on order of the Secretary, directly to the underpaid employee. Any amount not paid to an employee because of inability to do so within 3 years shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement of Chapter</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Sections 6506 and 6507 of this title govern the Secretary's authority to enforce this chapter, including the Secretary's authority to prescribe regulations, issue orders, hold hearings, make decisions based on findings of fact, and take other appropriate action under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitations and Regulations for Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may provide reasonable limitations and may prescribe regulations allowing reasonable variation, tolerances, and exemptions with respect to this chapter (other than subsection (f)), but only in special circumstances where the Secretary determines that the limitation, variation, tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of Federal Government business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of this chapter to protect prevailing labor standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of Wages and Benefits Due Under Predecessor Contracts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under a contract which succeeds a contract subject to this chapter, and under which substantially the same services are furnished, a contractor or subcontractor may not pay a service employee less than the wages and fringe benefits the service employee would have received under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective-bargaining agreement as a result of arm's-length negotiations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not apply if the Secretary finds after a hearing in accordance with regulations adopted by the Secretary that wages and fringe benefits under the predecessor contract are substantially at variance with wages and fringe benefits prevailing in the same locality for services of a similar character.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Duration of Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to limitations in annual appropriation acts but notwithstanding any other law, a contract to which this chapter applies may, if authorized by the Secretary, be for any term of years not exceeding 5, if the contract provides for periodic adjustment of wages and fringe benefits pursuant to future determinations, issued in the manner prescribed in section 6703 of this title at least once every 2 years during the term of the contract, covering each class of service employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of Fringe Benefit Payments in Determining Overtime Pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining any overtime pay to which a service employee is entitled under Federal law, the regular or basic hourly rate of pay of the service employee does not include any fringe benefit payments computed under this chapter which are excluded from the definition of &ldquo;regular rate&rdquo; under section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207(e)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Timeliness of Wage and Fringe Benefit Determinations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the intent of Congress that determinations of minimum wages and fringe benefits under section 6703(1) and (2) of this title should be made as soon as administratively feasible for all contracts subject to this chapter. In any event, the Secretary shall at least make the determinations for contracts under which more than 5 service employees are to be employed.</p>
