<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;individual under 16 years of age&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;male person under sixteen years of age or each female person under eighteen years of age&rdquo; to reflect the interpretation of this provision subsequent to enactment of civil rights laws such as section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42:2000e&ndash;2), as carried out by the Department of Labor through 41 C.F.R. Part 50&ndash;201.104. The words &ldquo;incarcerated individual&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;convict laborer&rdquo; because of the exception to convict labor that satisfies the conditions of 18:1761(c). Section 1761 does not apply to non-incarcerated convicts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b)(2) is substituted for &ldquo;a sum equal to the amount of any deductions, rebates, refunds, or <!-- PDFPage:112 -->underpayment of wages due to any employee engaged in the performance of such contract&rdquo; for consistency in the chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;made the contract&rdquo; and &ldquo;make other contracts&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;entering into such contract&rdquo; and &ldquo;enter into other contracts&rdquo;, respectively, for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;suit brought by the Attorney General&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;suits brought in the name of the United States of America by the Attorney General thereof&nbsp;&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
