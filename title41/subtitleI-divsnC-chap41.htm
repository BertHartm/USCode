<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already issued on a competitive basis; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a reasonable period of time to provide a proposal in response to the notice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) disclosure of the significant factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that the executive agency expects to consider in evaluating such proposals, and their relative importance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of an award that is to be made on a best value basis, a written statement documenting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the basis for the award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the relative importance of quality and price or cost factors; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an opportunity for a post-award debriefing consistent with the requirements of section 3704 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Protests.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Protest not authorized</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order except for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a protest of an order valued in excess of $10,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Jurisdiction over protests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 3556 of title 31, the Comptrol<!-- PDFPage:90 -->ler General shall have exclusive jurisdiction of a protest authorized under paragraph (1)(B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Appointment or designation and responsibilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of each executive agency who awards multiple task or delivery order contracts under section 4103(d)(1)(B) or 4105(f) of this title shall appoint or designate a task and delivery order ombudsman who shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors on those contracts and ensuring that all of the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task or delivery orders when required under subsection (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Who is eligible</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The task and delivery order ombudsman shall be a senior agency official who is independent of the contracting officer for the contracts and may be the executive agency's advocate for competition.</p>
