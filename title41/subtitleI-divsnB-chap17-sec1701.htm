<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure effective and efficient spending of public funds through fundamental reforms in Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

<p class="note-body">(a) Review agency procurement rules, reporting requirements, contractual requirements, certification procedures, and other administrative procedures over and above those required by statute, and, where practicable, replace them with guiding principles that encourage and reward innovation;</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) Ensure that procurement organizations focus on measurable results and on increased attention to understanding and meeting customer needs;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:27 --><p class="note-body">(d) Increase the use of commercially available items where practicable, place more emphasis on past contractor performance, and promote best value rather than simply low cost in selecting sources for supplies and services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Ensure that simplified acquisition procedures are used, to the maximum extent practicable, for procurements under the simplified acquisition threshold in order to reduce administrative burdens and more effectively support the accomplishment of agency missions;</p>

L. 103&ndash;355, see Short Title of 1994 Act note set out under section 101 of this title] by delegating the authority, to the maximum extent practicable, to the offices that will be using the supplies or services to be purchased;</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Establish clear lines of contracting authority and accountability;</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Establish career education programs for procurement professionals, including requirements for successful completion of educational requirements or mandatory training for entry level positions and for promotion to higher level positions, in order to ensure a highly qualified procurement work force;</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Designate a Procurement Executive with agency-wide responsibility to oversee development of procurement goals, guidelines, and innovation, measure and evaluate procurement office performance against stated goals, enhance career development of the procurement work force, and advise the agency heads whether goals are being achieved; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(j) Review existing and planned information technology acquisitions and contracts to ensure that the agency receives the best value with regard to price and technology, and consider alternatives in cases where best value is not being obtained.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with the heads of executive agencies, shall ensure that personnel policies and classification standards meet the needs of executive agencies for a professional procurement work force.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. The Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, after consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall work jointly with the heads of executive agencies to provide broad policy guidance and overall leadership necessary to achieve procurement reform, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Coordinating Government-wide efforts;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Assisting executive agencies in streamlining guidance for procurement processes;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Identifying desirable Government-wide procurement system criteria; and</p>
