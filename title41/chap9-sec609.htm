<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an action against the Tennessee Valley Authority, the contractor may only bring an action directly on the claim in a United States district court pursuant to section 1337 of title 28, notwithstanding any contract provision, regulation, or rule of law to the contrary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any action under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be filed within twelve months from the date of the receipt by the contractor of the decision of the contracting officer concerning the claim, and shall proceed de novo in accordance with the rules of the appropriate court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Finality of board decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of an appeal by a contractor or the Government from a decision of any agency board pursuant to section 607 of this title, notwithstanding any contract provision, regulation, or rules of law to the contrary, the decision of the agency board on any question of law shall not be final or conclusive, but the decision on any question of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside unless the decision is fraudulent, or arbitrary, or capricious, or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith, or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Remand or retention of case</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any appeal by a contractor or the Government from a decision of an agency board pursuant to section 607 of this title, the court may render an opinion and judgement and remand the case for further action by the agency board or by the executive agency as appropriate, with such direction as the court considers just and proper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consolidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If two or more suits arising from one contract are filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims and one or more agency boards, for the convenience of parties or witnesses or in the interest of justice, the United States Court of Federal Claims may order the consolidation of such suits in that court or transfer any suits to or among the agency boards involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judgments as to fewer than all claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any suit filed pursuant to this chapter involving two or more claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, or third-party claims, and where a portion of one such claim can be divided for purposes of decision or judgment, and in any such suit where multiple parties are involved, the court, whenever such action is appropriate, may enter a judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims, portions thereof, or parties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Advisory opinions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever an action involving an issue described in paragraph (2) is pending in a district court of the United States, the district court may request a board of contract appeals to provide the court with an advisory opinion on the matters of contract interpretation at issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An issue referred to in paragraph (1) is any issue that could be the proper subject of a final decision of a contracting officer appealable under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A district court shall direct any request under paragraph (1) to the board of contract appeals having jurisdiction under this chapter to adjudicate appeals of contract claims under the contract or contracts being interpreted by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) After receiving a request for an advisory opinion under paragraph (1), a board of contract appeals shall provide the advisory opinion in a timely manner to the district court making the request.</p>
