<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) publishing a statement notifying employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the person's workplace and specifying the actions that will be taken against employees for violations of such prohibition;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the person's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse violations;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the performance of <!-- PDFPage:157 -->such contract be given a copy of the statement required by subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) notifying the employee in the statement required by subparagraph (A), that as a condition of employment on such contract, the employee will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) abide by the terms of the statement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) notify the employer of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than 5 days after such conviction;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) notifying the contracting agency within 10 days after receiving notice under subparagraph (D)(ii) from an employee or otherwise receiving actual notice of such conviction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) imposing a sanction on, or requiring the satisfactory participation in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program by, any employee who is so convicted, as required by section 703 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free workplace through implementation of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirement for individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No Federal agency shall enter into a contract with an individual unless such individual agrees that the individual will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance in the performance of the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suspension, termination, or debarment of contractor</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grounds for suspension, termination, or debarment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each contract awarded by a Federal agency shall be subject to suspension of payments under the contract or termination of the contract, or both, and the contractor thereunder or the individual who entered the contract with the Federal agency, as applicable, shall be subject to suspension or debarment in accordance with the requirements of this section if the head of the agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contractor violates the requirements of subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (F) of subsection (a)(1) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such a number of employees of such contractor have been convicted of violations of criminal drug statutes for violations occurring in the workplace as to indicate that the contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace as required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Conduct of suspension, termination, and debarment proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If a contracting officer determines, in writing, that cause for suspension of payments, termination, or suspension or debarment exists, an appropriate action shall be initiated by a contracting officer of the agency, to be conducted by the agency concerned in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and applicable agency procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be revised to include rules for conducting suspension and debarment proceedings under this subsection, including rules providing notice, opportunity to respond in writing or in person, and such other procedures as may be necessary to provide a full and fair proceeding to a contractor or individual in such proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of debarment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon issuance of any final decision under this subsection requiring debarment of a contractor or individual, such contractor or individual shall be ineligible for award of any contract by any Federal agency, and for participation in any future procurement by any Federal agency, for a period specified in the decision, not to exceed 5 years.</p>
