<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;In this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as used in this Act&rdquo; as the probable intent of Congress. Section 9(a) of the Act of August 2, 1946 (ch. 744, 60 Stat. 809) restated 41:5 generally and section 9(c) of the Act, an independent provision, was editorially added as the last paragraph of 41:5. The definitions which apply to &ldquo;as used in this Act&rdquo; are probably intended to apply also to 41:5 as re<!-- PDFPage:106 -->stated by the Act. The definitions for &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;continental United States&rdquo; are omitted because those terms do not appear in 41:5. In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;section 9104 of title 31&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;section 104 of the Government Corporation Control Act, approved December 6, 1945&rdquo; because of section 4(b) of Public Law. 97&ndash;258 (31 U.S.C. note prec. 101). In paragraphs (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;shall be construed to include&rdquo; and for &ldquo;shall be construed as including&rdquo;, respectively, to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;as authorized by section 29 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1638)&rdquo; in section 3709 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because section 29 was repealed by section 602(a)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 399).</p>
