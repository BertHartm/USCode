This broad competition is best achieved where there is an expansive pool of potential contractors capable of producing quality <!-- PDFPage:55 -->goods and services at competitive prices. A great and largely untapped opportunity for expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in this Nation's economically distressed communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically distressed communities and ensuring that those contractors become viable businesses for the long term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement and help to empower those communities. Fostering growth of long-term viable contractors will be promoted by offering appropriate incentives to qualified businesses.</p>

In developing such policies and procedures, the Secretary shall consider the size of the qualified businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Monitoring and Evaluation</em>. The Secretary shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) monitor the implementation and operation of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) develop a process to ensure the proper administration of the program and to reduce the potential for fraud by the intended beneficiaries of the program;</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) by December 1 of each year, issue a report to the President on the status and effectiveness of the program.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Implementation Guidelines</em>. In implementing this order, the Secretary shall:</p>
