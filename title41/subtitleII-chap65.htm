<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13126, June 12, 1999, 64 F.R. 32383, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to continue the executive branch's commitment to fighting abusive child labor practices, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap>. 1. <em>Policy</em>. It shall be the policy of the United States Government, consistent with the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1307, the Fair Labor Standards Act [of 1938], 29 U.S.C. 201 <em>et. seq</em>., and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act [Walsh-Healey Act], [former] 41 U.S.C. 35 <em>et seq</em>. [see 41 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.], that executive agencies shall take appropriate actions to enforce the laws prohibiting the manufacture or importation of goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced or indentured child labor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Publication of List</em>. Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Department of Labor, in consultation and cooperation with the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State, shall publish in the Federal Register a list of products, identified by their country of origin, that those Departments have a reasonable basis to believe might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. The Department of Labor may conduct hearings to assist in the identification of those products.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Procurement Regulations</em>. Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue proposed rules to implement the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Required Solicitation Provisions</em>. Each solicitation of offers for a contract for the procurement of a product included on the list published under section 2 of this order shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A provision that requires the contractor to certify to the contracting officer that the contractor or, in the case of an incorporated contractor, a responsible official of the contractor has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract and that, on the basis of those efforts, the contractor is unaware of any such use of child labor; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A provision that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to the contractor's records, documents, persons, or premises if reasonably requested by authorized officials of the con<!-- PDFPage:110 -->tracting agency, the Department of the Treasury, or the Department of Justice, for the purpose of determining whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Investigations</em>. Whenever a contracting officer of an executive agency has reason to believe that forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture a product furnished pursuant to a contract subject to the requirements of subsection 3(a) of this order, the head of the executive agency shall refer the matter for investigation to the Inspector General of the executive agency and, as the head of the executive agency or the Inspector General determines appropriate, to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Remedies.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The head of an executive agency may impose remedies as provided in this subsection in the case of a contractor under a contract of the executive agency if the head of the executive agency finds that the contractor:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) Has furnished under the contract products that have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor or uses forced or indentured child labor in the mining, production, or manufacturing operations of the contractor;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) Has submitted a false certification under subsection 3(a)(1) of this order; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) Has failed to cooperate in accordance with the obligation imposed pursuant to subsection 3(a)(2) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The head of an executive agency, in his or her sole discretion, may terminate a contract on the basis of any finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order for any contract entered into after the date the regulation called for in section 3 of this order is published in final.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The head of an executive agency may debar or suspend a contractor from eligibility for Federal contracts on the basis of a finding that the contractor has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order. The provision for debarment may not exceed 3 years.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The Administrator of General Services shall include on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs (maintained by the Administrator as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) each party that is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or suspension, or declared ineligible by the head of an agency on the basis that the person has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) This section shall not be construed to limit the use of other remedies available to the head of an executive agency or any other official of the Federal Government on the basis of a finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Report</em>. Within 2 years after implementation of any final rule under this order, the Administrator of General Services, with the assistance of other executive agencies, shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget a report on the actions taken pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Scope</em>. (a) Any proposed rules issued pursuant to section 3 of this order shall apply only to acquisitions for a total amount in excess of the micro-purchase threshold as defined in section 32(f) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 428(f)).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order does not apply to a contract that is for the procurement of any product, or any article, material, or supply contained in a product that is mined, produced, or manufactured in any foreign country if:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) the foreign country is a party to the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or a party to the North American Free Trade Agreement (&ldquo;NAFTA&rdquo;); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater than the United States threshold specified in the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or NAFTA, whichever is applicable.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Definitions</em>. (a) &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; have the meaning given to &ldquo;executive agency&rdquo; in section 4(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(1)).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;WTO Agreement&rdquo; means the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, entered into on April 15, 1994.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Forced or indentured child labor&rdquo; means all work or service (1) exacted from any person under the age of 18 under the menace of any penalty for its nonperformance and for which the worker does not offer himself voluntarily; or (2) performed by any person under the age of 18 pursuant to a contract the enforcement of which can be accomplished by process or penalties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A contract made by an agency of the United States for the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment, in an amount exceeding $10,000, shall include the following representations and stipulations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Minimum wages to be paid</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All individuals employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract will be paid, without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, not less than the prevailing minimum wages, as determined by the Secretary, for individuals employed in similar work or in the particular or similar industries or groups of industries currently operating in the locality in which the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment are to be manufactured or furnished under the contract, except that this paragraph applies only to purchases or contracts relating to industries that have been the subject matter of a determination by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Maximum number of hours to be worked in a week</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No individual employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract shall be permitted to work in excess of 40 hours in any one week, except that this paragraph does not apply to an employer who has entered into an agreement with employees pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of section 7(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207(b)(1) or (2)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Ineligible employees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No individual under 16 years of age and no incarcerated individual will be employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract, except that this section, or other law or executive order containing similar prohibitions against the purchase of goods by the Federal Government, does not apply to convict labor that satisfies the conditions of section 1761(c) of title 18.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Standards of places and working conditions where contract performed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No part of the contract will be performed, and no materials, supplies, articles, or equipment will be manufactured or fabricated under the con<!-- PDFPage:111 -->tract, in plants, factories, buildings, or surroundings, or under working conditions, that are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health and safety of employees engaged in the performance of the contract. Compliance with the safety, sanitary, and factory inspection laws of the State in which the work or part of the work is to be performed is prima facie evidence of compliance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the matter before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;and entered into&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;under the contract&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;used in the performance of the contract&rdquo; in 41:35(a) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the chapter. The words &ldquo;Sections 35 to 45 of this title shall apply to all contracts entered into pursuant to invitations for bids issued on or after ninety days from June 30, 1936&rdquo; in 41:45 are omitted as obsolete.</p>

<p class="note-body">In paragraph (3), the words &ldquo;No individual under 16 years of age&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;no male person under sixteen years of age and no female person under eighteen years of age&rdquo; to reflect the interpretation of this provision subsequent to enactment of civil rights laws such as section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42:2000e&ndash;2), as carried out by the Department of Labor through 41 C.F.R. Part 50&ndash;201.104. The words &ldquo;incarcerated individual&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; the first time the words appear because the term &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; is ambiguous and may be interpreted to include individuals who are not incarcerated. This would be an inappropriate interpretation because 41:35(c) provides an exception for &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; that satisfies the conditions of 18:1761(c) regarding certain non-Federal prison work projects. The words &ldquo;or production&rdquo; are omitted for consistency with the source provisions for paragraphs (1) and (2) and because, in this context, the concept of &ldquo;production&rdquo; is included in the words &ldquo;manufacture or furnishing&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;under the contract&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;included in such contract&rdquo; for consistency in the chapter.</p>

On order of the Secretary, the amount shall be paid directly to the underpaid employee on whose account the amount was withheld or recovered.

The words &ldquo;the United States District Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; in section 5 of the Act of June 30, 1936 (which were substituted for &ldquo;the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia&rdquo; by section 32(b) of the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 646, 62 Stat. 991), as amended by section 127 of the Act of May 24, 1949 (ch. 139, 63 Stat. 107), and which were editorially omitted from 41:39) are omitted as included in &ldquo;a district court of the United States&rdquo; because of sections 88 and 132(a) of title 28, United States Code.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the duty to make findings of fact is restated as a duty of the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative). The grammatical structure of the last sentence of 41:39 seems to suggest that the court, rather than the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative), serves as fact finder. However, the provision taken as a whole indicates that it is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) who serves as fact finder. It is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) before whom hearings are held, witnesses testify, and evidence is produced. The court's involvement is limited to compelling recalcitrant witnesses &ldquo;to appear before him [the Secretary] or representative designated by him&rdquo;. The restatement clarifies the generally accepted understanding that the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) serves as fact finder (see, e.g., <em>United States v. Sweet Briar</em>, 92 F. Supp. 777, 780 (W.D.S.C. 1950) (&ldquo;the Secretary &lsquo;shall make findings of fact&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;); <em>Ready-Mix Concrete Company v. United States</em>, 158 F. Supp. 571, 578 (Cl.

<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) is substituted for &ldquo;Title III of the act entitled &lsquo;An Act making appropriations for the Treasury and Post Office Departments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934, and for other purposes&rsquo;, approved May 3, 1933 (commonly known as the Buy American Act)&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to correct an error in the source, which incorrectly gives May 3, 1933, rather than March 3, 1933, as the date of approval.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) is substituted for &ldquo;the Act entitled &lsquo;An Act relating to the rate of wages for laborers and mechanics employed on public buildings of the United States and the District of Columbia by contractors and subcontractors, and for other purposes&rsquo;, approved March 3, 1931 (commonly known as the Bacon-Davis Act), as amended from time to time&rdquo; because of section 5(c) of Public Law 107&ndash;217 (40 U.S.C. note prec. 101) and for consistency with title 40.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;the labor provisions of Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, as extended&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete because of section 201 of the Act of June 21, 1938 (ch. 554, 52 Stat. 816), as amended by the Acts of June 27, 1940 (ch. 437, 54 Stat. 633), April 5, 1941 (ch. 40, 55 Stat. 110), and June 27, 1942 (ch. 450, 56 Stat. 410).</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;or [the labor provisions] of section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, approved April 8, 1935&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The intended reference was probably to section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 118). Section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 provided that the President shall require certain rates of pay for persons engaged in carrying out projects that were financed by amounts being appropriated in that Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) is substituted for &ldquo;the Act entitled &lsquo;An Act to provide for the diversification of employment of Federal prisoners, for their training and schooling in trades and occupations, and for other purposes&rsquo;, approved May 27, 1930, as amended and supplemented by the Act approved June 23, 1934&rdquo; for consistency with title 18. The Act of May 27, 1930 (ch. 340, 46 Stat. 391) and the Act of June 23, 1934 (ch. 736, 48 Stat. 1211), which were classified to sections 744a to 744n of former title 18, were substantially repealed and were replaced by chapter 307 and section 4162 of title 18 in the codification of title 18 by the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 645, 62 Stat. 683). Subsequently, section 4162 of title 18 was repealed by section 218(a)(4) of Public Law 98&ndash;473 (98 Stat. 2027).</p>
