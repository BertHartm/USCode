<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;In this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as used in this Act&rdquo; as the probable intent of Congress. Section 9(a) of the Act of August 2, 1946 (ch. 744, 60 Stat. 809) restated 41:5 generally and section 9(c) of the Act, an independent provision, was editorially added as the last paragraph of 41:5. The definitions which apply to &ldquo;as used in this Act&rdquo; are probably intended to apply also to 41:5 as restated by the Act. The definitions for &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;continental United States&rdquo; are omitted because those terms do not appear in 41:5. In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;section 9104 of title 31&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;section 104 of the Government Corporation Control Act, approved December 6, 1945&rdquo; because of section 4(b) of Public Law. 97&ndash;258 (31 U.S.C. note prec. 101). In paragraphs (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;shall be construed to include&rdquo; and for &ldquo;shall be construed as including&rdquo;, respectively, to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;as authorized by section 29 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1638)&rdquo; in section 3709 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because section 29 was repealed by section 602(a)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 399).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Contract provision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy, or another department or agency of the Federal Government designated by the President may, on a determination of need by the President, provide or be amended without consideration to provide that payments made to an assignee under the contract are not subject to reduction or setoff. Each determination of need by the President under this subparagraph shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:107 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Carrying out contract provision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a &ldquo;no reduction or setoff&rdquo; provision as described in subparagraph (A) is included in a contract, payments to the assignee are not subject to reduction or setoff for an assignor's liability arising&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13126, June 12, 1999, 64 F.R. 32383, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to continue the executive branch's commitment to fighting abusive child labor practices, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap>. 1. <em>Policy</em>. It shall be the policy of the United States Government, consistent with the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1307, the Fair Labor Standards Act [of 1938], 29 U.S.C. 201 <em>et. seq</em>., and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act [Walsh-Healey Act], [former] 41 U.S.C. 35 <em>et seq</em>. [see 41 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.], that executive agencies shall take appropriate actions to enforce the laws prohibiting the manufacture or importation of goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced or indentured child labor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Publication of List</em>. Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Department of Labor, in consultation and cooperation with the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State, shall publish in the Federal Register a list of products, identified by their country of origin, that those Departments have a reasonable basis to believe might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. The Department of Labor may conduct hearings to assist in the identification of those products.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Procurement Regulations</em>. Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue proposed rules to implement the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Required Solicitation Provisions</em>. Each solicitation of offers for a contract for the procurement of a product included on the list published under section 2 of this order shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A provision that requires the contractor to certify to the contracting officer that the contractor or, in the case of an incorporated contractor, a responsible official of the contractor has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract and that, on the basis of those efforts, the contractor is unaware of any such use of child labor; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A provision that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to the contractor's records, documents, persons, or premises if reasonably requested by authorized officials of the con<!-- PDFPage:110 -->tracting agency, the Department of the Treasury, or the Department of Justice, for the purpose of determining whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Investigations</em>. Whenever a contracting officer of an executive agency has reason to believe that forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture a product furnished pursuant to a contract subject to the requirements of subsection 3(a) of this order, the head of the executive agency shall refer the matter for investigation to the Inspector General of the executive agency and, as the head of the executive agency or the Inspector General determines appropriate, to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Remedies.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The head of an executive agency may impose remedies as provided in this subsection in the case of a contractor under a contract of the executive agency if the head of the executive agency finds that the contractor:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) Has furnished under the contract products that have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor or uses forced or indentured child labor in the mining, production, or manufacturing operations of the contractor;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) Has submitted a false certification under subsection 3(a)(1) of this order; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) Has failed to cooperate in accordance with the obligation imposed pursuant to subsection 3(a)(2) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The head of an executive agency, in his or her sole discretion, may terminate a contract on the basis of any finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order for any contract entered into after the date the regulation called for in section 3 of this order is published in final.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The head of an executive agency may debar or suspend a contractor from eligibility for Federal contracts on the basis of a finding that the contractor has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order. The provision for debarment may not exceed 3 years.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The Administrator of General Services shall include on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs (maintained by the Administrator as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) each party that is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or suspension, or declared ineligible by the head of an agency on the basis that the person has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) This section shall not be construed to limit the use of other remedies available to the head of an executive agency or any other official of the Federal Government on the basis of a finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Report</em>. Within 2 years after implementation of any final rule under this order, the Administrator of General Services, with the assistance of other executive agencies, shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget a report on the actions taken pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Scope</em>. (a) Any proposed rules issued pursuant to section 3 of this order shall apply only to acquisitions for a total amount in excess of the micro-purchase threshold as defined in section 32(f) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 428(f)).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order does not apply to a contract that is for the procurement of any product, or any article, material, or supply contained in a product that is mined, produced, or manufactured in any foreign country if:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) the foreign country is a party to the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or a party to the North American Free Trade Agreement (&ldquo;NAFTA&rdquo;); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater than the United States threshold specified in the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or NAFTA, whichever is applicable.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Definitions</em>. (a) &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; have the meaning given to &ldquo;executive agency&rdquo; in section 4(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(1)).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;WTO Agreement&rdquo; means the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, entered into on April 15, 1994.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Forced or indentured child labor&rdquo; means all work or service (1) exacted from any person under the age of 18 under the menace of any penalty for its nonperformance and for which the worker does not offer himself voluntarily; or (2) performed by any person under the age of 18 pursuant to a contract the enforcement of which can be accomplished by process or penalties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person.</p>

The words &ldquo;incarcerated individual&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; the first time the words appear because the term &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; is ambiguous and may be interpreted to include individuals who are not incarcerated. This would be an inappropriate interpretation because 41:35(c) provides an exception for &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; that satisfies the conditions of 18:1761(c) regarding certain non-Federal prison work projects. The words &ldquo;or production&rdquo; are omitted for consistency with the source provisions for paragraphs (1) and (2) and because, in this context, the concept of &ldquo;production&rdquo; is included in the words &ldquo;manufacture or furnishing&rdquo;.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the duty to make findings of fact is restated as a duty of the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative). The grammatical structure of the last sentence of 41:39 seems to suggest that the court, rather than the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative), serves as fact finder. However, the provision taken as a whole indicates that it is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) who serves as fact finder. It is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) before whom hearings are held, witnesses testify, and evidence is produced. The court's involvement is limited to compelling recalcitrant witnesses &ldquo;to appear before him [the Secretary] or representative designated by him&rdquo;. The restatement clarifies the generally accepted understanding that the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) serves as fact finder (see, e.g., <em>United States v. Sweet Briar</em>, 92 F. Supp. 777, 780 (W.D.S.C. 1950) (&ldquo;the Secretary &lsquo;shall make findings of fact&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;); <em>Ready-Mix Concrete Company v. United States</em>, 158 F. Supp. 571, 578 (Cl. Ct. 1958) (&ldquo;the findings of the Department of Labor&rdquo;)).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13495. Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13495, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 6103, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">When a service contract expires, and a follow-on contract is awarded for the same service, at the same location, the successor contractor or its subcontractors often hires the majority of the predecessor's employees. On some occasions, however, a successor contractor or its subcontractors hires a new work force, thus displacing the predecessor's employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are served when the successor contractor hires the predecessor's employees. A carryover work force reduces disruption to the delivery of services during the period of transition between contractors and provides the Federal Government the benefits of an experienced and trained work force that is familiar with the Federal Government's personnel, facilities, and requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq</em>., and in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. It is the policy of the Federal Government that service contracts and solicitations for such contracts shall include a clause that requires the contractor, and its subcontractors, under a contract that succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services at the same location, to offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. There shall be no employment openings under the contract until such right of first refusal has been provided. Nothing in this order shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive Order or law of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Service contract&rdquo; or &ldquo;contract&rdquo; means any contract or subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or its contractors that is covered by the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 351 <em>et seq</em>., and its implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Employee&rdquo; means a service employee as defined in the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. 357(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Exclusions</em>. This order shall not apply to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) contracts or subcontracts under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in 41 U.S.C. 403;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) contracts or subcontracts awarded pursuant to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 46&ndash;48c;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodial services provided to the Federal Government under contracts or subcontracts with sheltered workshops employing the severely handicapped as described in section 505 of the Treasury, Postal Services [sic] and General Government Appropriations Act, 1995, Public Law 103&ndash;329;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) agreements for vending facilities entered into pursuant to the preference regulations issued under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) employees who were hired to work under a Federal service contract and one or more nonfederal service contracts as part of a single job, provided that the employees were not deployed in a manner that was designed to avoid the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Authority to Exempt Contracts</em>. If the head of a contracting department or agency finds that the application of any of the requirements of this order would not serve the purposes of this order or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services on an economical and efficient basis, the head of such department or agency may exempt its department or agency from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of this order with respect to a particular contract, subcontract, or purchase order or any class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Contract Clause</em>. The following contract clause shall be included in solicitations for and service contracts that succeed contracts for performance of the same or similar work at the same location:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;NONDISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, the contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which employees are qualified. The contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. Except as provided in paragraph (b) there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. The contractor and its subcontractors shall make an express offer of employment to each employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (a) above, the contractor and any subcontractors (1) may employ under this contract any employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least 3 months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (2) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 357(b), and (3) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222&ndash;41(n), the contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. The Contracting Officer will provide the list to the successor contractor, and the list shall be provided on request to employees or their representatives.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the contractor or its subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation <!-- PDFPage:118 -->or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order (No.) &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; [13495], the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) In every subcontract entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the contractor will include provisions that ensure that each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b) with respect to the employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor contractor and its subcontractors. The subcontract shall also include provisions to ensure that the subcontractor will provide the contractor with the information about the employees of the subcontractor needed by the contractor to comply with paragraph 5(c), above. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: provided, however, that if the contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the contractor may request that the United States enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Enforcement</em>. (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) is responsible for investigating and obtaining compliance with this order. In such proceedings, the Secretary shall have the authority to issue final orders prescribing appropriate sanctions and remedies, including, but not limited to, orders requiring employment and payment of wages lost. The Secretary also may provide that where a contractor or subcontractor has failed to comply with any order of the Secretary or has committed willful violations of this order or the regulations issued pursuant thereto, the contractor or subcontractor, and its responsible officers, and any firm in which the contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest, shall be ineligible to be awarded any contract of the United States for a period of up to 3 years. Neither an order for debarment of any contractor or subcontractor from further Government contracts under this section nor the inclusion of a contractor or subcontractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors shall be carried out without affording the contractor or subcontractor an opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act [of 1978] [see 41 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.], and disputes regarding the requirement of the contract clause prescribed by section 5 of this order, to the extent permitted by law, shall be disposed of only as provided by the Secretary in regulations issued under this order. To the extent practicable, such regulations shall favor the resolution of disputes by efficient and informal alternative dispute resolution methods. The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, issue regulations, within 180 days of the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, to implement the requirements of this order. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue, within 180 days of the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion of the contract clause in Federal solicitations and contracts subject to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Revocation</em>. Executive Order 13204 of February 17, 2001, is revoked.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this order, or the application of such provision or amendment to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>General Provisions</em>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final decisions by the Secretary in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. <em>Effective Date</em>. This order shall become effective immediately and shall apply to solicitations issued on or after the effective date for the action taken by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council under section 6(b) of this order.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Liability of Responsible Party</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A party responsible for a violation of a contract provision required under section 6703(1) or (2) of this title or a violation of section 6704 of this title is liable for an amount equal to the sum of any deduction, rebate, refund, or underpayment of compensation due any employee engaged in the performance of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Recovery of Amounts Underpaid to Employees.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Withholding accrued payments due on contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The total amount determined under subsection (a) to be due any employee engaged in the performance of a contract may be withheld from accrued payments due on the contract or on any other contract between the same contractor and the Federal Government. The amount withheld shall be held in a deposit fund. On order of the Secretary, the compensation found by the Secretary or the head of a Federal agency to be due an underpaid employee pursuant to this chapter shall be paid from the deposit fund directly to the underpaid employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Bringing actions against contractors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse a service employee with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the compensation required pursuant to this <!-- PDFPage:119 -->chapter, the Federal Government may bring action against the contractor, subcontractor, or any sureties in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the remaining amount of underpayment. Any amount recovered shall be held in the deposit fund and shall be paid, on order of the Secretary, directly to the underpaid employee. Any amount not paid to an employee because of inability to do so within 3 years shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement of Chapter</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Sections 6506 and 6507 of this title govern the Secretary's authority to enforce this chapter, including the Secretary's authority to prescribe regulations, issue orders, hold hearings, make decisions based on findings of fact, and take other appropriate action under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitations and Regulations for Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may provide reasonable limitations and may prescribe regulations allowing reasonable variation, tolerances, and exemptions with respect to this chapter (other than subsection (f)), but only in special circumstances where the Secretary determines that the limitation, variation, tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of Federal Government business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of this chapter to protect prevailing labor standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of Wages and Benefits Due Under Predecessor Contracts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under a contract which succeeds a contract subject to this chapter, and under which substantially the same services are furnished, a contractor or subcontractor may not pay a service employee less than the wages and fringe benefits the service employee would have received under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective-bargaining agreement as a result of arm's-length negotiations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not apply if the Secretary finds after a hearing in accordance with regulations adopted by the Secretary that wages and fringe benefits under the predecessor contract are substantially at variance with wages and fringe benefits prevailing in the same locality for services of a similar character.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Duration of Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to limitations in annual appropriation acts but notwithstanding any other law, a contract to which this chapter applies may, if authorized by the Secretary, be for any term of years not exceeding 5, if the contract provides for periodic adjustment of wages and fringe benefits pursuant to future determinations, issued in the manner prescribed in section 6703 of this title at least <!-- PDFPage:120 -->once every 2 years during the term of the contract, covering each class of service employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of Fringe Benefit Payments in Determining Overtime Pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining any overtime pay to which a service employee is entitled under Federal law, the regular or basic hourly rate of pay of the service employee does not include any fringe benefit payments computed under this chapter which are excluded from the definition of &ldquo;regular rate&rdquo; under section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207(e)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Timeliness of Wage and Fringe Benefit Determinations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the intent of Congress that determinations of minimum wages and fringe benefits under section 6703(1) and (2) of this title should be made as soon as administratively feasible for all contracts subject to this chapter. In any event, the Secretary shall at least make the determinations for contracts under which more than 5 service employees are to be employed.</p>
