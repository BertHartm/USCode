<h4 class="note-head">Executive Order No. 12969</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12969, Aug. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 40989, which provided for Federal agencies to contract with companies that report in a public manner on toxic chemicals released to the environment, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13148, &sect;901, Apr. 21, 2000, 65 F.R. 24604, formerly set out as a note under section 4321 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Streamlining Procurement Through Electronic Commerce</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993, 58 F.R. 58095, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods and services. Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity. Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-effectiveness. The electronic exchange of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult under the current system. For these reasons, I am committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>1. OBJECTIVES.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) exchange procurement information&mdash;such as solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual documents&mdash;electronically between the private sector and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement opportunities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and access Federal procurement data.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>2. IMPLEMENTATION.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">The President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch through the following actions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide implementation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department or agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective department or agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) assist the President's Management Council in implementing the electronic commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance with the schedules established herein; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) designate one or more senior level employees to assist the President's Management Council and serve as a point of contact for the development and implementation of the Federal electronic commerce system within each respective department or agency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>3. NO PRIVATE RIGHTS CREATED.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 270 days after October 14, 2008, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall develop and issue a standard policy to prevent personal conflicts of interest by contractor employees performing acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions (including the development, award, and administration of Government contracts) for or on behalf of a Federal agency or department.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:121 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Elements of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The policy required under subsection (a) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide a definition of the term &ldquo;personal conflict of interest&rdquo; as it relates to contractor employees performing acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require each contractor whose employees perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) identify and prevent personal conflicts of interest for employees of the contractor who are performing such functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prohibit contractor employees who have access to non-public government information obtained while performing such functions from using such information for personal gain;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) report any personal conflict-of-interest violation by such an employee to the applicable contracting officer or contracting officer's representative as soon as it is identified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) maintain effective oversight to verify compliance with personal conflict-of-interest safeguards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) have procedures in place to screen for potential conflicts of interest for all employees performing such functions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) take appropriate disciplinary action in the case of employees who fail to comply with policies established pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contract clause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Administrator shall develop a personal conflicts-of-interest clause or a set of clauses for inclusion in solicitations and contracts (and task or delivery orders) for the performance of acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions that sets forth the personal conflicts-of-interest policy developed under this subsection and that sets forth the contractor's responsibilities under such policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall take effect 300 days after October 14, 2008, and shall apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) contracts entered into on or after that effective date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) task or delivery orders awarded on or after that effective date, regardless of whether the contracts pursuant to which such task or delivery orders are awarded are entered before, on, or after October 14, 2008.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), this subsection shall apply to any contract for an amount in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 403(11) of this title) if the contract is for the performance of acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If only a portion of a contract described in subparagraph (A) is for the performance of acquisition functions described in that subparagraph, then this subsection applies only to that portion of the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review of Federal acquisition regulation relating to conflicts of interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 12 months after October 14, 2008, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, shall review the Federal Acquisition Regulation to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify contracting methods, types and services that raise heightened concerns for potential personal and organizational conflicts of interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determine whether revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation are necessary to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) address personal conflicts of interest by contractor employees with respect to functions other than those described in subsection (a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) achieve sufficiently rigorous, comprehensive, and uniform government-wide policies to prevent and mitigate organizational conflicts of interest in Federal contracting.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulatory revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Administrator determines pursuant to the review under paragraph (1)(B) that revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation are necessary, the Administrator shall work with the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to prescribe appropriate revisions to the regulations, including the development of appropriate contract clauses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than March 1, 2010, the Administrator shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the Senate, and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives a report setting forth such findings and determinations under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1), together with an assessment of any revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that may be necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Best practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall, in consultation with the Director of the Office Government Ethics, develop and maintain a repository of best practices relating to the prevention and mitigation of organizational and personal conflicts of interest in Federal contracting.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Implementing regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Board shall promulgate rules and regulations for the implementation of cost accounting standards promulgated or interpreted under subsection (f) of this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) agree to a contract price adjustment, with interest, for any increased costs paid to such contractor or subcontractor by the United States by reason of a change in the contractor's or subcontractor's cost accounting practices or by reason of a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable cost accounting standards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the United States and a contractor or subcontractor fail to agree on a contract price adjustment, including whether the contractor or subcontractor has complied with the applicable cost accounting standards, the disagreement will constitute a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act [41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any contract price adjustment undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be made, where applicable, on relevant contracts between the United States and the contractor that are subject to the cost accounting standards so as to protect the United States from payment, in the aggregate, of increased costs (as defined by the Board). In no case shall the Government recover costs greater than the increased cost (as defined by the Board) to the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, unless the contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of the price negotiation and which it failed to disclose to the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The interest rate applicable to any contract price adjustment shall be the annual rate of interest established under section 6621 of title 26 for such period. Such interest shall accrue from the time payments of the increased costs were made to the contractor or subcontractor to the time the United States receives full compensation for the price adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Omitted</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Existing cost accounting standards referred to in paragraph (1) shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same manner as if promulgated by the Board under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator, under the authority set forth in section 405 of this title, shall ensure that no regulation or proposed regulation of an executive agency is inconsistent with a cost accounting standard promulgated or amended <!-- PDFPage:140 -->under this section by rescinding or denying the promulgation of any such inconsistent regulation or proposed regulation and taking such other action authorized under section 405 of this title as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Costs which are the subject of cost accounting standards promulgated under this section shall not be subject to regulations that are established by another executive agency that differ from such standards with respect to the measurement, assignment, and allocation of such costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Examinations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The head of an executive agency should, to the maximum extent practicable, use modular contracting for an acquisition of a major system of information technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Modular contracting described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under modular contracting, an executive agency's need for a system is satisfied in successive acquisitions of interoperable increments. Each increment complies with common or commercially accepted standards applicable to information technology so that the increments are compatible with other increments of information technology comprising the system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under the modular contracting process, an acquisition of a major system of information technology may be divided into several smaller acquisition increments that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are easier to manage individually than would be one comprehensive acquisition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) address complex information technology objectives incrementally in order to enhance the likelihood of achieving workable solutions for attainment of those objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide for delivery, implementation, and testing of workable systems or solutions in discrete increments each of which comprises a system or solution that is not dependent on any subsequent increment in order to perform its principal functions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) provide an opportunity for subsequent increments of the acquisition to take advantage of any evolution in technology or needs that occur during conduct of the earlier increments;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a contract for an increment of an information technology acquisition should, to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded within 180 days after the date on which the solicitation is issued and, if the contract for that increment cannot be awarded within such period, the increment should be considered for cancellation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the information technology provided for in a contract for acquisition of information technology should be delivered within 18 months after the date on which the solicitation resulting in award of the contract was issued.</p>
