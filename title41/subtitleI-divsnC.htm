<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13005. Empowerment Contracting</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13005, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26069, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, it is necessary to secure broad-based competition for Federal contracts. This broad competition is best achieved where there is an expansive pool of potential contractors capable of producing quality goods and services at competitive prices. A great and largely untapped opportunity for expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in this Nation's economically distressed communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically distressed communities and ensuring that those contractors become viable businesses for the long term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement and help to empower those communities. Fostering growth of long-term viable contractors will be promoted by offering appropriate incentives to qualified businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 486(a) [now 121(a)] of title 40, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. The purpose of this order is to strengthen the economy and to improve the efficiency of the Federal procurement system by encouraging business development that expands the industrial base and increases competition.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Empowerment Contracting Program</em>. In consultation with the Secretaries of the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Defense; the Administrator of General Services; the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Administrator of the Small Business Administration; and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall develop policies and procedures to ensure that agencies, to the extent permitted by law, grant qualified large businesses and qualified small businesses appropriate incentives to encourage business activity in areas of general economic distress, including a price or an evaluation credit, when assessing offers for government contracts in unrestricted competitions, where the incentives would promote the policy set forth in this order. In developing such policies and procedures, the Secretary shall consider the size of the qualified businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Monitoring and Evaluation</em>. The Secretary shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) monitor the implementation and operation of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) develop a process to ensure the proper administration of the program and to reduce the potential for fraud by the intended beneficiaries of the program;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) develop principles and a process to evaluate the effectiveness of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) by December 1 of each year, issue a report to the President on the status and effectiveness of the program.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Implementation Guidelines</em>. In implementing this order, the Secretary shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) issue rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to implement this order, including a requirement for the periodic review of the eligibility of qualified businesses and distressed areas;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) draft all rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to implement this order within 90 days of the date of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) ensure that all policies and procedures and all rules, regulations, and guidelines adopted and implemented in accordance with this order minimize the administrative burden on affected agencies and the procurement process.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Definitions</em>. For purposes of this Executive order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; means any authority of the United States that is an &ldquo;agency&rdquo; under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Area of general economic distress&rdquo; shall be defined, for all urban and rural communities, as any census tract that has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or any designated Federal Empowerment Zone, Supplemental Empowerment Zone, Enhanced Enterprise Community, or Enterprise Community. In addition, the Secretary may designate as an area of general economic distress any additional rural or Indian reservation area after considering the following factors:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Unemployment rate;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Degree of poverty;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Extent of outmigration; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Rate of business formation and rate of business growth.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Qualified large business&rdquo; means a large for-profit or not-for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a significant number of residents from the area of general economic distress; and (2) either has a significant physical presence in the area of general economic distress or has a direct impact on generating significant economic activity in the area of general economic distress.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) &ldquo;Qualified small business&rdquo; means a small for-profit or not-for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a <!-- PDFPage:58 -->significant number of residents from the area of general economic distress; (2) has a significant physical presence in the area of general economic distress; or (3) has a direct impact on generating significant economic activity in the area of general economic distress.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; means the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Agency Authority</em>. Nothing in this Executive order shall be construed as displacing the agencies&rsquo; authority or responsibilities, as authorized by law, including specifically other programs designed to promote the development of small or disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This Executive order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Government Contracting</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Mar. 4, 2009, 74 F.R. 9755, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government has an overriding obligation to American taxpayers. It should perform its functions efficiently and effectively while ensuring that its actions result in the best value for the taxpayers.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since 2001, spending on Government contracts has more than doubled, reaching over $500 billion in 2008. During this same period, there has been a significant increase in the dollars awarded without full and open competition and an increase in the dollars obligated through cost-reimbursement contracts. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, for example, dollars obligated under cost-reimbursement contracts nearly doubled, from $71 billion in 2000 to $135 billion in 2008. Reversing these trends away from full and open competition and toward cost-reimbursement contracts could result in savings of billions of dollars each year for the American taxpayer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Excessive reliance by executive agencies on sole-source contracts (or contracts with a limited number of sources) and cost-reimbursement contracts creates a risk that taxpayer funds will be spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the needs of the Federal Government or the interests of the American taxpayer. Reports by agency Inspectors General, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and other independent reviewing bodies have shown that noncompetitive and cost-reimbursement contracts have been misused, resulting in wasted taxpayer resources, poor contractor performance, and inadequate accountability for results.</p>
<p class="note-body">When awarding Government contracts, the Federal Government must strive for an open and competitive process. However, executive agencies must have the flexibility to tailor contracts to carry out their missions and achieve the policy goals of the Government. In certain exigent circumstances, agencies may need to consider whether a competitive process will not accomplish the agency's mission. In such cases, the agency must ensure that the risks associated with noncompetitive contracts are minimized.</p>
<p class="note-body">Moreover, it is essential that the Federal Government have the capacity to carry out robust and thorough management and oversight of its contracts in order to achieve programmatic goals, avoid significant overcharges, and curb wasteful spending. A GAO study last year of 95 major defense acquisitions projects found cost overruns of 26 percent, totaling $295 billion over the life of the projects. Improved contract oversight could reduce such sums significantly.</p>
<p class="note-body">Government outsourcing for services also raises special concerns. For decades, the Federal Government has relied on the private sector for necessary commercial services used by the Government, such as transportation, food, and maintenance. Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;76, first issued in 1966, was based on the reasonable premise that while inherently governmental activities should be performed by Government employees, taxpayers may receive more value for their dollars if non-inherently governmental activities that can be provided commercially are subject to the forces of competition.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, the line between inherently governmental activities that should not be outsourced and commercial activities that may be subject to private sector competition has been blurred and inadequately defined. As a result, contractors may be performing inherently governmental functions. Agencies and departments must operate under clear rules prescribing when outsourcing is and is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the policy of the Federal Government that executive agencies shall not engage in noncompetitive contracts except in those circumstances where their use can be fully justified and where appropriate safeguards have been put in place to protect the taxpayer. In addition, there shall be a preference for fixed-price type contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts shall be used only when circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract. Moreover, the Federal Government shall ensure that taxpayer dollars are not spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the Federal Government's needs and to manage the risk associated with the goods and services being procured. The Federal Government must have sufficient capacity to manage and oversee the contracting process from start to finish, so as to ensure that taxpayer funds are spent wisely and are not subject to excessive risk. Finally, the Federal Government must ensure that those functions that are inherently governmental in nature are performed by executive agencies and are not outsourced.</p>
<p class="note-body">I hereby direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator of General Services, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the heads of such other agencies as the Director of OMB determines to be appropriate, and with the participation of appropriate management councils and program management officials, to develop and issue by July 1, 2009, Government-wide guidance to assist agencies in reviewing, and creating processes for ongoing review of, existing contracts in order to identify contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, or not otherwise likely to meet the agency's needs, and to formulate appropriate corrective action in a timely manner. Such corrective action may include modifying or canceling such contracts in a manner and to the extent consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">I further direct the Director of OMB, in collaboration with the aforementioned officials and councils, and with input from the public, to develop and issue by September 30, 2009, Government-wide guidance to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) govern the appropriate use and oversight of sole-source and other types of noncompetitive contracts and to maximize the use of full and open competition and other competitive procurement processes;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) govern the appropriate use and oversight of all contract types, in full consideration of the agency's needs, and to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts generally, consistent with the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to section 864 of Public Law 110&ndash;417;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) assist agencies in assessing the capacity and ability of the Federal acquisition workforce to develop, manage, and oversee acquisitions appropriately; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) clarify when governmental outsourcing for services is and is not appropriate, consistent with section 321 of Public Law 110&ndash;417 (31 U.S.C. 501 note).</p>
<p class="note-body">Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive <!-- PDFPage:59 -->or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Federal Government would be seriously injured unless the execu<!-- PDFPage:63 -->tive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a Federally funded research and development center;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the Federal Government and a foreign government or an international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for that government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to section 3105 of this title, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another executive agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, the property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) substantial duplication of cost to the Federal Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) unacceptable delay in fulfilling the executive agency's needs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may not exceed one year unless the head of the executive agency entering into the contract determines that exceptional circumstances apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Offer Requests to Potential Sources</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An executive agency using procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property or services by reason of the application of paragraph (2) or (6) of subsection (a) shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) exceeding $10,000,000 but equal to or less than $50,000,000, by the head of the procuring activity or by a delegate who, if a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer or, if a civilian, is serving in a position in which the individual is enti<!-- PDFPage:64 -->tled to receive the daily equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any required notice has been published with respect to the contract pursuant to section 1708 of this title and the executive agency has considered all bids or proposals received in response to that notice.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Justification allowed after contract awarded</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (a)(2), the justification and approval required by paragraph (1) may be made after the contract is awarded.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specify its needs and solicit bids or proposals in a manner designed to achieve full and open competition for the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) use advance procurement planning and market research; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) significantly less important than cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subsection, the term &ldquo;executive agency&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 133 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Scope of allowance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Acquisition Regulation at a minimum shall provide that a solicitation for the acquisition of property or services may not set forth any requirement or evaluation criteria that would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) render an offeror ineligible to enter into a contract on the basis of the inclusion of a plan of the offeror to allow the offeror's employees to telecommute, unless the contracting officer concerned first determines that the requirements of the agency, including security requirements, cannot be met if telecommuting is allowed and documents in writing the basis for the determination; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduce the scoring of an offer on the basis of the inclusion in the offer of a plan of the offeror to allow the offeror's employees to telecommute, unless the contracting officer concerned first determines that the requirements of the agency, including security requirements, would be adversely impacted if telecommuting is allowed and documents in writing the basis for the determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Development Contract.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Determining whether proposals are necessary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require the proposals, the head of the agency shall consider the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If the proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents of proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a development contract are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items that are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items that the Federal Government will be able to acquire competitively in the future.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Production Contract.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Determining whether proposals are necessary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require the proposals, the head of the agency shall consider the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If the proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Content of proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a production contract are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the Federal Government will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to this requirement may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Proposals to provide to the Federal Government the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the Federal Government of acquiring the data and the right to use the data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Factors as Objectives in Negotiations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in subsections (a) and (b) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40 or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an executive agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) that the procedures are appropriate for use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contracting officer anticipates that 3 or more offers will be received for the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The time constraints for delivery of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The capability and experience of potential contractors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Other criteria established by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures Described</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:70 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Development of scope of work statement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Federal Government's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals that meet the Federal Government's needs. If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation of phase-one proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include information on the offeror's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) technical approach; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical qualifications; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) do not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) detailed design information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) cost or price information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Evaluation factors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team), and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Selection by contracting officer.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Number of offerors selected and what is to be evaluated</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information. Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work, or both; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with subsections (b) to (d) of section 3306 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Separate evaluations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Awarding of contract</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agency awards the contract in accordance with chapter 37 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation To State Number of Offerors To Be Selected for Phase-Two Requests for Competitive Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4). The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Federal Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Requirement for Guidance and Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting contractors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;qualification requirement&rdquo; means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions Before Enforcing Qualification Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (c), the head of an agency, before enforcing any qualification requirement, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror on request all requirements that a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy to become qualified, with those requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specify an estimate of the cost of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror to become qualified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, on request, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate at its own expense (except as provided in subsection (d)) its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) qualified personnel and facilities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) of the agency concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) of another agency obtained through interagency agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) under contract; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of paragraph (4), provide to the extent possible that those services be provided by a contractor that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is required in the contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed whether qualification is attained and, if not attained, is promptly furnished specific information about why qualification was not attained.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applicability, Waiver Authority, and Referral of Offers.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (b) does not apply to a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Waiver authority.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Submission of determination of unreasonableness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification that a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Authority to grant waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing the determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2) to (5) of subsection (b) for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplicability to qualified products list</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Waiver authority under this paragraph does not apply with respect to a qualified products list.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Submission and consideration of offer not to be denied</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet those standards before the date specified for award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Referral to small business administration not required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not require the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)) if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with that requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Delay of procurement not required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement to comply with subsection (b) or to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Provision Requiring Adjustment.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under section 3502(b) of this title is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the Federal Government, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that the price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make the certificate available) submitted defective cost or pricing data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>What constitutes defective cost or pricing data</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this chapter, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data that, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed on between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree on a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed on by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Valid Defense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it is a defense that the Federal Government did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Invalid Defenses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by subsection (a) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the Federal Government about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required by section 3502(b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Offsets.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>When allowed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, consistent with subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in section 3502(c) of this title before that date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>When not allowed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the certification under section 3502(b) of this title with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Federal Government proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in paragraph (1)(B) been submitted to the Federal Government before date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, under subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, the submission of the cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for interest on the amount of the overpayment, to be computed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of the overpayment to the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the submission of the defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. Heads of executive departments and agencies (&ldquo;agencies&rdquo;) engaged in the procurement of supplies and services shall prescribe administrative procedures for the resolution of protests to the award of their procurement contracts as an alternative to protests in fora outside the procuring agencies. Procedures prescribed pursuant to this order shall:</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) to the maximum extent practicable, provide for inexpensive, informal, procedurally simple, and expeditious resolution of protests, including, where appropriate and as permitted by law, the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques, third party neutrals, and another agency's personnel;</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) except where immediate contract award or performance is justified for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined to be in the best interest of the United States, prohibit award or performance of the contract while a timely filed protest is pending before the agency. To allow for the withholding of a contract award or performance, the agency must have received notice of the protest within either 10 calendar days after the contract award or 5 calendar days after the bidder or offeror who is protesting the contract award was given the opportunity to be debriefed by the agency, whichever date is later.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall: (a) work with the heads of executive agencies to provide policy guidance and leadership necessary to implement provisions of this order; and</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq</em>., and in order to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Government contracts, it is hereby ordered that:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement. When the Federal Government contracts for goods or services, it has a proprietary interest in ensuring that those contracts will be performed by contractors whose work will not be interrupted by labor unrest. The attainment of industrial peace is most easily achieved and workers&rsquo; productivity is enhanced when workers are well informed of their rights under Federal labor laws, including the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. 151 <em>et seq</em>. As the Act recognizes, &ldquo;encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection&rdquo; will &ldquo;eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce&rdquo; and &ldquo;mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have oc<!-- PDFPage:81 -->curred.&rdquo; 29 U.S.C. 151. Relying on contractors whose employees are informed of such rights under Federal labor laws facilitates the efficient and economical completion of the Federal Government's contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Contract Clause</em>. Except in contracts exempted in accordance with section 3 of this order, all Government contracting departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, include the following provisions in every Government contract, other than collective bargaining agreements as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(8) and purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 403.</p>

The notice shall include the information contained in the notice published by the Secretary of Labor in the Federal Register (Secretary's Notice).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;2. The contractor will comply with all provisions of the Secretary's Notice, and related rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;3. In the event that the contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) or (2) above, this contract may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in or adopted pursuant to Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]]. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided in Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]], or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as are otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (3) above in every subcontract entered into in connection with this contract (unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]]) so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: Provided, however, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Administration</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary shall adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as are necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.</p>

Such notice shall describe the rights of employees under Federal labor laws, consistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Whenever the Secretary finds that an act of Congress, clarification of existing law by the courts or the National Labor Relations Board, or other circumstances make modification of the contractual provisions set out in subsection (a) of this section necessary to achieve the purposes of this order, the Secretary promptly shall issue such rules, regulations, or orders as are needed to cause the substitution or addition of appropriate contractual provisions in Government contracts thereafter entered into.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Exemptions</em>.

<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary may, if the Secretary finds that special circumstances require an exemption in order to serve the national interest, exempt a contracting department or agency from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of section 2 of this order with respect to a particular contract or subcontract or class of contracts or subcontracts.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary may hold hearings, or cause hearings to be held, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, prior to imposing, ordering, or recommending the imposition of sanctions under this order. Neither an order for cancellation, termination, or suspension of any contract or debarment of any contractor from further Government contracts under section 7(b) of this order nor the inclusion of a contractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors under section 7(c) of this order shall be carried out without affording the contractor an opportunity for a hearing.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13502. Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13502, Feb. 6, 2009, 74 F.R. 6985, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq</em>., and in order to promote the efficient administration and completion of Federal construction projects, it is hereby ordered that:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. (a) Large-scale construction projects pose special challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the Federal Government. Construction employers typically do not have a permanent workforce, which makes it difficult for them to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts being performed. Challenges also arise due to the fact that construction projects typically involve multiple employers at a single location. A labor dispute involving one employer can delay the entire project. A lack of coordination among various employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of employment of various groups of workers, can create frictions and disputes in the absence of an agreed-upon resolution mechanism. These problems threaten the efficient and timely completion of construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors. On larger projects, which are generally more complex and of longer duration, these problems tend to be more pronounced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The use of a project labor agreement may prevent these problems from developing by providing structure and stability to large-scale construction projects, thereby promoting the efficient and expeditious completion of Federal construction contracts. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage executive agencies to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &ldquo;labor organization&rdquo; as used in this order means a labor organization as defined in 29 U.S.C. 152(5).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The term &ldquo;construction&rdquo; as used in this order means construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of buildings, highways, or other real property.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The term &ldquo;large-scale construction project&rdquo; as used in this order means a construction project where the total cost to the Federal Government is $25 million or more.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The term &ldquo;executive agency&rdquo; as used in this order has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 105, but excludes the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The term &ldquo;project labor agreement&rdquo; as used in this order means a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) In awarding any contract in connection with a large-scale construction project, or obligating funds pursuant to such a contract, executive agencies may, on a project-by-project basis, require the use of a project labor agreement by a contractor where use of such an agreement will (i) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters, and (ii) be consistent with law.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:83 --><p class="note-body">(b) If an executive agency determines under subsection (a) that the use of a project labor agreement will satisfy the criteria in clauses (i) and (ii) of that subsection, the agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor or subcontractor on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more appropriate labor organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. Any project labor agreement reached pursuant to this order shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) bind all contractors and subcontractors on the Construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property or services for more than one, but not more than 5, program years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Enter Into Contract</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An executive agency may enter into a multiyear contract for the acquisition of property or services if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funds are available and obligated for the contract, for the full period of the contract or for the first fiscal year in which the contract is in effect, and for the estimated costs associated with a necessary termination of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need for the property or services is reasonably firm and continuing over the period of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a multiyear contract will serve the best interests of the Federal Government by encouraging full and open competition or promoting economy in administration, performance, and operation of the agency's programs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Termination Clause</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A multiyear contract entered into under the authority of this section shall include a clause that provides that the contract shall be terminated if funds are not made available for the continuation of the contract in a fiscal year covered by the contract. Funds available for paying termination costs shall remain available for that purpose until the costs associated with termination of the contract are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation Ceiling Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before a contract described in subsection (b) that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $10,000,000 may be awarded, the executive agency shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to Congress. The contract may not be awarded until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Contingency Clause for Appropriation of Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A multiyear contract may provide that performance under the contract after the first year of the contract is contingent on the appropriation of funds and (if the contract does so provide) that a cancellation payment shall be made to the contractor if the funds are not appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Other Law Not Affected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not modify or affect any other provision of law that authorizes multiyear contracts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a solicitation for which the head of the executive agency concerned determines in writing that, because the services required under the contract are unique or highly specialized, it is not practicable to award more than one contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the award of a follow-on contract has been delayed by circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the initial contract was entered into; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extension is necessary to ensure continuity of the receipt of services pending the award of, and commencement of performance under, the follow-on contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limit of one extension</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A task order contract may be extended under paragraph (1) only once and only in accordance with the limitations and requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Contract That Provides for Delivery of Technical Data</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract for property or services entered into by an executive agency that provides for the delivery of technical data shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a contractor or subcontractor at any tier shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer a written justification for any restriction the contractor or subcontractor asserts on the right of the Federal Government to use the data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the contracting officer may review the validity of a restriction the contractor or subcontractor asserts under the contract on the right of the Federal Government to use technical data furnished to the Federal Government under the contract if the contracting officer determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction and that the continued adherence to the asserted restriction by the Federal Government would make it impracticable to procure the item competitively at a later time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Challenge of Restriction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If after a review the contracting officer determines that a challenge to the asserted restriction is warranted, the contracting officer shall provide written notice to the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction. The notice shall state&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the grounds for challenging the asserted restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement for a response within 60 days justifying the current validity of the asserted restriction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Additional Time for Responses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a restriction subject to this section submits to the contracting officer a written request showing the need for additional time to comply with the requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted restriction, the contracting officer shall provide appropriate additional time to adequately permit the justification to be submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Multiple Challenges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges <!-- PDFPage:99 -->to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the earliest challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each challenge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Decision on Validity of Asserted Restriction.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>No response submitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction if the contractor or subcontractor does not submit a response under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Response submitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 60 days of receipt of a justification submitted in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (b), a contracting officer shall issue a decision or notify the party asserting the restriction of the time within which a decision will be issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Claim Deemed Claim Within Chapter</cap-smallcap> 71.&mdash;A claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction that is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier is deemed to be a claim within the meaning of chapter 71 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Final Disposition of Challenge.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Challenge is sustained</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the Federal Government to use technical data is sustained on final disposition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the restriction is cancelled; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, is liable to the Federal Government for payment of the cost to the Federal Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the Federal Government in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make the payment unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Challenge not sustained</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the Federal Government to use technical data is not sustained on final disposition, the Federal Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) continues to be bound by the restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is liable for payment to the party asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction if the challenge by the Federal Government is found not to be made in good faith.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Investigation of Complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An individual who believes that the individual has been subjected to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (b) may submit a complaint to the Inspector General of the executive agency. Unless the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous, the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, on completion of the investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the individual, the contractor concerned, and the head of the agency. If the executive agency does not have an Inspector General, the duties of the Inspector General under this section shall be performed by an official designated by the head of the executive agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Remedy and Enforcement Authority.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a contractor fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the executive agency shall file an action for enforcement of the order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Review of enforcement order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain review of the order's conformance with this subsection, and regulations issued to carry out this section, in the United States court of appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred.
