<p class="note-body">In paragraph (3), the word &ldquo;individual&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;person&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 1:1. The words &ldquo;contract made by the Federal Government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;contract entered into by the United States&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;as of July 30, 1976, and any subsequent revision of those regulations&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (4)(A), the words &ldquo;the outer Continental Shelf&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Outer Continental Shelf lands&rdquo; for consistency with the definition in 43:1331 and for consistency with the more common usage generally found in subchapter III of chapter 29 of title 43. The words &ldquo;Eniwetok Atoll, Kwajalein Atoll&rdquo; are omitted because they are part of the Marshall Islands and therefore no longer part of the United States. The words &ldquo;Canton Island&rdquo; are omitted because it is part of Kiribati and therefore no longer part of the United States.</p>
