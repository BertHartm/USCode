<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Review of terminated settlements; limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any other provision of law notwithstanding, the function of the General Accounting Office with respect to any termination settlement made, authorized, ratified, or approved by a contracting agency shall be confined to determining, after final settlement, (1) whether the settlement payments to the war contractor were made in accordance with the settlement, and (2) whether the records transmitted to it, or other information, warrant a reasonable belief that the settlement was induced by fraud. For this purpose the General Accounting Office shall have the authority to examine any records maintained by any contracting agency or by any war contractor relating to any termination settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of fraudulent settlements to Department of Justice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Comptroller General is convinced that any settlement was induced by fraud, he shall so certify, together with all the facts relating thereto, to the Department of Justice, to the Administrator of General Services, and to the contracting agency concerned. Upon receipt of such certificate (1) the Department of Justice shall make an investigation to determine whether such settlement was induced by fraud, and (2) until the Department of Justice notifies the contracting agency that in its opinion the facts do not support the belief that the settlement was induced by fraud, the contracting agency, by set-off or otherwise, may withhold, from amounts owing to the war contractor by the United States under such settlement or otherwise, the amount of the settlement, or the portion thereof, which, in the opinion of the Comptroller General as stated in his certificate, was affected by the fraud. In any such case the Department of Justice shall take such action as it deems appropriate to recover payments made to such war contractor. The General Accounting Office shall not suspend credit to any disbursing officer on any disbursements made by him under such settlement in the absence of fraud on his part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller General may investigate the settlements completed by each contracting agency for the purpose of reporting to the Congress from time to time on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether the settlement methods and procedures employed by such agency are of a kind and type designed to result in expeditious and fair settlements in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter and the orders and regulations of the Administrator of General Services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether such methods and procedures are followed by such agency with care and efficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether such methods and procedures adequately protect the interest of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">If in any such report the Comptroller General shall find that the settlement methods and procedures fail to meet the foregoing standards, he shall make suggestions and recommendations to such agency for the improvement of such methods and procedures and to the Congress for any additional legislation needed to carry out the policies of this chapter. At least thirty days before filing any such report with the Congress, the Comptroller General shall deliver a copy thereof to the agency concerned and the Administrator of General Services, and shall forward to the Congress together with such report any comments of such agency with respect thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Jurisdiction of Comptroller General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The jurisdiction of the Comptroller General of the United States shall not be affected by this chapter except to the extent necessary to give effect to the specific provisions thereof.</p>
