<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(F), the words &ldquo;Department of Education&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Department of Health and Human Services&rdquo; in 41:46(a)(1) to correct a mistake in the United States Code. In the amendment to the original provision by section 1 of Public Law 92&ndash;28 (85 Stat. 77), an officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was one of the members appointed to the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, because the Department, through the Rehabilitation Services Administration, had the major governmental function in the field of vocational rehabilitation for the blind and other severely handicapped and administered related vocational rehabilitation programs for individuals with disabilities. See House Report 92&ndash;228. Under section <!-- PDFPage:137 -->301(a)(4)(A) and (C) and (b)(3) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20:3441(a)(4)(A) and (C) and (b)(3)), the functions and offices of the Department and the functions of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services were transferred to the Department or Secretary of Education. Section 509 of the Act (20:3508) redesignated the Department and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare as the Department and Secretary of Health and Human Services, respectively, and provided that references to the Department and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare were deemed to be references to the Department or Secretary of Health and Human Services except to the extent a reference was to a function of the Department or Secretary of Education. The reference in 41:46(a)(1) was changed to &ldquo;Department of Health and Human Services&rdquo; but should have been changed to &ldquo;Department of Education&rdquo;. Furthermore, the regulations of the Committee include the Department of Education in the list of members of the Committee. See 41 CFR 51&ndash;2.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the text of 41:46(d)(2) and (4) is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), the reference to section 5376 of title 5 is substituted for the reference to grade GS&ndash;18 of the General Schedule because of section 529 [title I, &sect;101(c)(1)] of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101&ndash;509, 104 Stat. 1442, 5 U.S.C. 5376 note). The word &ldquo;actual&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;A member is entitled to travel expenses, including a per diem allowance instead of subsistence, as provided under section 5703 of title 5&rdquo; are substituted for 41:46(e)(3) to eliminate unnecessary words. The reference to section 5703 of title 5 is substituted for the reference to section 5703(b) of title 5 because of the amendment to section 5703 by section 4 of the Travel Expense Amendments Act of 1975 (Public Law 94&ndash;22, 89 Stat. 85).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words &ldquo;its duties and powers&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g)(1), the reference to chapter 33 of title 5 is substituted for &ldquo;the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service&rdquo; for clarity and for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (j), the words &ldquo;and to the Congress&rdquo; are omitted pursuant to section 3003 of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (31 U.S.C. 1113 note). See, also, page 199 of House Document No. 103&ndash;7.</p>
