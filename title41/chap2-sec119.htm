<p class="note-body">As originally enacted, the second undesignated paragraph of this section contained the words, &ldquo;,&nbsp;the District of Columbia&rdquo; after &ldquo;The several district courts of the United States&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;District of Columbia&rdquo; have been deleted entirely as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that &ldquo;There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district&rdquo;, and section 88 of Title 28 which states that &ldquo;the District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section was comprised of subsecs. (a) and (c) to (e) of section 19 of act July 1, 1944. Subsec. (b) of section 19 was classified to section 590a of Title 18, Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure, prior to the general revision and enactment of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, by act June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 683. Subsecs. (a), (d), and (e) of section 19 were repealed by act June 25, 1948, leaving only subsec. (c) of section 19, which comprises this section. Subject matter of former subsecs. (a), (d), and (e) of section 19 is covered by sections 201, 287, 443, and 1001 of Title 18.</p>
