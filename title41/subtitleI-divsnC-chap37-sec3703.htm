<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Evaluation and Award</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An executive agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in accordance with section 3701(a) of this title and may award a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after discussions with the offerors, provided that written or oral discussions have been conducted with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) based on the proposals received and without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification), if, as required by section 3306(b)(2)(B)(i) of this title, the solicitation included a statement that proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
