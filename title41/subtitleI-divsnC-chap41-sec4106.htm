<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already issued on a competitive basis; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a reasonable period of time to provide a proposal in response to the notice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) disclosure of the significant factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that the executive agency expects to consider in evaluating such proposals, and their relative importance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of an award that is to be made on a best value basis, a written statement documenting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the basis for the award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the relative importance of quality and price or cost factors; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an opportunity for a post-award debriefing consistent with the requirements of section 3704 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Work</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A task or delivery order shall include a statement of work that clearly specifies all tasks to be performed or property to be delivered under the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Protests.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Protest not authorized</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order except for&mdash;</p>
