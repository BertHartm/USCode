<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Submission of cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section in the case of a contract, a subcontract, or a modification of a contract or subcontract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for which the price agreed upon is based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) adequate price competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) established catalog or market prices of commercial items that are sold in substantial quantities to the general public; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) prices set by law or regulation; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in an exceptional case when the head of the procuring activity, without delegation, determines that the requirements of this section may be waived and justifies in writing the reasons for such determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Modifications of contracts and subcontracts for commercial items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a modification of a contract or subcontract for a commercial item that is not covered by the prohibition on the submission of cost or pricing data in paragraph (1)(A), submission of cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contract or subcontract being modified is a contract or subcontract for which submission of cost or pricing data <!-- PDFPage:76 -->may not be required by reason of paragraph (1)(A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the modification would not change the contract or subcontract, as the case may be, from a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of an item other than a commercial item.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) FAR standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide clear standards for determining whether the exceptions provided in paragraph (1)(A) apply. In the case of the exception provided in paragraph (1)(A)(i), the regulations shall specify the criteria to be used to determine whether adequate price competition exists. In the case of the exception provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), the regulations shall provide that the exception applies to items that are sold in substantial quantities to the general public, without regard to the quantity of items that may be sold to the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restrictions on additional authority to require cost or pricing data or other information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to require cost or pricing data on below-threshold contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), when cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted by subsection (a) of this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, such data may nevertheless be required to be submitted by the head of the procuring activity, but only if the head of the procuring activity determines that such data are necessary for the evaluation by the agency of the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract. In any case in which the head of the procuring activity requires such data to be submitted under this subsection, the head of the procuring activity shall justify in writing the reason for such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The head of the procuring activity may not require certified cost or pricing data to be submitted under this paragraph for any contract or subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, covered by the exceptions in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The head of a procuring activity may not delegate the functions under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to require information other than certified cost or pricing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted under this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, the head of the procuring activity may require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional exception provisions regarding commercial items</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Procurements based on adequate price competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the maximum extent practicable, the head of an executive agency shall conduct procurements of commercial items on a competitive basis. In any procurement of a commercial item conducted on a competitive basis and based upon adequate price competition, the head of the executive agency conducting the procurement shall not require cost or pricing data to be submitted under subsection (a) of this section for the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract under the procurement. If additional information is necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract, the head of the executive agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, obtain the additional information from sources other than the offeror.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procurements not based on adequate price competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) In any case in which it is not practicable to conduct a procurement of a commercial item covered by subsection (a) of this section on a competitive basis, and the procurement is not covered by an exception in subsection (b) of this section, the contracting officer shall seek to obtain from the offeror or contractor information described in clause (ii). When such information is not available from that source, the contracting officer shall seek to obtain such information from another source or sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The information referred in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#254b_1_target" name="254b_1">1</a></sup> clause (i) is information on prices at which the same item or similar items have been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating, through price analysis, the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract under the procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The contracting officer shall exempt a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract under the procurement from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section if the contracting officer obtains the information described in subparagraph (A)(ii) in accordance with standards and procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A contracting officer may require submission of cost or pricing data under subsection (a) of this section only if the contracting officer makes a written determination that the agency is unable to obtain the information described in subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authority to audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In accordance with procedures prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the head of an executive agency is authorized to examine all information provided by an offeror, contractor, or subcontractor pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) and all books and records <!-- PDFPage:77 -->of such offeror, contractor, or subcontractor that directly relate to such information in order to determine whether the agency is receiving accurate information required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The right under subparagraph (A) shall expire 2 years after the date of award of the contract, or 2 years after the date of the modification of the contract, with respect to which the information was provided.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitations on requests for data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include reasonable limitations on requests under this subsection for sales data relating to commercial items.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Form of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In requesting information from an offeror under this subsection, a contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, limit the scope of the request to include only information that is in the form regularly maintained by the offeror in commercial operations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Confidentiality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any information received under this subsection that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5 shall not be disclosed by the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under subsection (a)(2) of this section is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that such price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or pricing data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it shall be a defense that the United States did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the United States about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section before such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable under paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Interest and penalties for certain overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract with an executive agency subject to this section and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for interest on the amount of such overpayment, to be computed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays <!-- PDFPage:78 -->the amount of such overpayment to the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of title 26; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the submission of such defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any liability under this subsection of a contractor that submits cost or pricing data but refuses to submit the certification required by subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data shall not be affected by the refusal to submit such certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Right of United States to examine contractor records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and currency of cost or pricing data required to be submitted by this section, an executive agency shall have the authority provided by section 254d(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Required regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include regulations concerning the types of information that offerors must submit for a contracting officer to consider in determining whether the price of a procurement to the Government is fair and reasonable when certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted under this section because the price of the procurement to the United States is not expected to exceed the applicable threshold amount set forth in subsection (a) of this section (as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (7) of such subsection). Such information, at a minimum, shall include appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price of a proposed contract or subcontract for the procurement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cost or pricing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;cost or pricing data&rdquo; means all facts that, as of the date of agreement on the price of a contract (or the price of a contract modification) or, if applicable consistent with subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section, another date agreed upon between the parties, a prudent buyer or seller would reasonably expect to affect price negotiations significantly. Such term does not include information that is judgmental, but does include the factual information from which a judgment was derived.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Subcontract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; includes a transfer of commercial items between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or a subcontractor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Commercial item</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; has the meaning provided such term by section 403(12) of this title.</p>
