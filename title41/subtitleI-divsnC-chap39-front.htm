<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq</em>., and in order to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Government contracts, it is hereby ordered that:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement. When the Federal Government contracts for goods or services, it has a proprietary interest in ensuring that those contracts will be performed by contractors whose work will not be interrupted by labor unrest. The attainment of industrial peace is most easily achieved and workers&rsquo; productivity is enhanced when workers are well informed of their rights under Federal labor laws, including the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. 151 <em>et seq</em>. As the Act recognizes, &ldquo;encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection&rdquo; will &ldquo;eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce&rdquo; and &ldquo;mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have oc<!-- PDFPage:81 -->curred.&rdquo; 29 U.S.C. 151. Relying on contractors whose employees are informed of such rights under Federal labor laws facilitates the efficient and economical completion of the Federal Government's contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Contract Clause</em>. Except in contracts exempted in accordance with section 3 of this order, all Government contracting departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, include the following provisions in every Government contract, other than collective bargaining agreements as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(8) and purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 403.</p>

The notice shall include the information contained in the notice published by the Secretary of Labor in the Federal Register (Secretary's Notice).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;2. The contractor will comply with all provisions of the Secretary's Notice, and related rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;3. In the event that the contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) or (2) above, this contract may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in or adopted pursuant to Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]]. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided in Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]], or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as are otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (3) above in every subcontract entered into in connection with this contract (unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]]) so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: Provided, however, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Administration</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary shall adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as are necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.</p>

Such notice shall describe the rights of employees under Federal labor laws, consistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Whenever the Secretary finds that an act of Congress, clarification of existing law by the courts or the National Labor Relations Board, or other circumstances make modification of the contractual provisions set out in subsection (a) of this section necessary to achieve the purposes of this order, the Secretary promptly shall issue such rules, regulations, or orders as are needed to cause the substitution or addition of appropriate contractual provisions in Government contracts thereafter entered into.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Exemptions</em>.

<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary may hold hearings, or cause hearings to be held, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, prior to imposing, ordering, or recommending the imposition of sanctions under this order. Neither an order for cancellation, termination, or suspension of any contract or debarment of any contractor from further Government contracts under section 7(b) of this order nor the inclusion of a contractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors under section 7(c) of this order shall be carried out without affording the contractor an opportunity for a hearing.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13502. Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13502, Feb. 6, 2009, 74 F.R. 6985, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq</em>., and in order to promote the efficient administration and completion of Federal construction projects, it is hereby ordered that:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. (a) Large-scale construction projects pose special challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the Federal Government. Construction employers typically do not have a permanent workforce, which makes it difficult for them to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts being performed. Challenges also arise due to the fact that construction projects typically involve multiple employers at a single location. A labor dispute involving one employer can delay the entire project. A lack of coordination among various employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of employment of various groups of workers, can create frictions and disputes in the absence of an agreed-upon resolution mechanism. These problems threaten the efficient and timely completion of construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors. On larger projects, which are generally more complex and of longer duration, these problems tend to be more pronounced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The use of a project labor agreement may prevent these problems from developing by providing structure and stability to large-scale construction projects, thereby promoting the efficient and expeditious completion of Federal construction contracts. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage executive agencies to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &ldquo;labor organization&rdquo; as used in this order means a labor organization as defined in 29 U.S.C. 152(5).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The term &ldquo;construction&rdquo; as used in this order means construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of buildings, highways, or other real property.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The term &ldquo;large-scale construction project&rdquo; as used in this order means a construction project where the total cost to the Federal Government is $25 million or more.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The term &ldquo;executive agency&rdquo; as used in this order has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 105, but excludes the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The term &ldquo;project labor agreement&rdquo; as used in this order means a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) In awarding any contract in connection with a large-scale construction project, or obligating funds pursuant to such a contract, executive agencies may, on a project-by-project basis, require the use of a project labor agreement by a contractor where use of such an agreement will (i) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters, and (ii) be consistent with law.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:83 --><p class="note-body">(b) If an executive agency determines under subsection (a) that the use of a project labor agreement will satisfy the criteria in clauses (i) and (ii) of that subsection, the agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor or subcontractor on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more appropriate labor organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. Any project labor agreement reached pursuant to this order shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) bind all contractors and subcontractors on the Construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the project labor agreement;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work, safety, and health; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) fully conform to all statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. This order does not require an executive agency to use a project labor agreement on any construction project, nor does it preclude the use of a project labor agreement in circumstances not covered by this order, including leasehold arrangements and projects receiving Federal financial assistance. This order also does not require contractors or subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor organization.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council), to the extent permitted by law, shall take whatever action is required to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the provisions of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and with other officials as appropriate, shall provide the President within 180 days of this order, recommendations about whether broader use of project labor agreements, with respect to both construction projects undertaken under Federal contracts and construction projects receiving Federal financial assistance, would help to promote the economical, efficient, and timely completion of such projects.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Revocation of Prior Orders, Rules, and Regulations</em>. Executive Order 13202 of February 17, 2001, and Executive Order 13208 of April 6, 2001, are revoked. The heads of executive agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, revoke expeditiously any orders, rules, or regulations implementing Executive Orders 13202 and 13208.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this order, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. <em>General</em>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
