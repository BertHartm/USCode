<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to award</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the requirements of this section, section 253j of this title, and other applicable law, the head of an executive agency may enter into a task order contract (as defined in section 253k of this title) for procurement of advisory and assistance services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive agency may enter into a task order contract for advisory and assistance services only under the authority of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on contract period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The period of a task order contract entered into under this section, including all periods of extensions of the contract under options, modifications, or otherwise, may not exceed five years unless a longer period is specifically authorized in a law that is applicable to such contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Content of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notice required by section 416 of this title and section 637(e) of title 15 shall reasonably and fairly describe the general scope, magnitude, and duration of the proposed task order contract in a manner that would reasonably enable a potential offeror to decide whether to request the solicitation and consider submitting an offer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Required content of solicitation and contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The solicitation shall include the information (regarding services) described in section 253h(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A task order contract entered into under this section shall contain the same information that is required by paragraph (1) to be included in the solicitation of offers for that contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Multiple awards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The head of an executive agency may, on the basis of one solicitation, award separate task order contracts under this section for the same or similar services to two or more sources if the solicitation states that the head of the executive agency has the option to do so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, in the case of a task order contract for advisory and assistance services to be entered into under the authority of this section, the contract period is to exceed three years and the contract amount is estimated to exceed $10,000,000 (including all options), the solicitation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide for a multiple award authorized under paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include a statement that the head of the executive agency may also elect to award only one task order contract if the head of the executive agency determines in writing that only one of the offerers is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a solicitation for which the head of the executive agency concerned determines in writing that, because the services required under the contract are unique or highly specialized, it is not practicable to award more than one contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Contract modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A task order may not increase the scope, period, or maximum value of the task order contract under which the order is issued. The scope, period, or maximum value of the contract may be increased only by modification of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unless use of procedures other than competitive procedures is authorized by an exception in subsection (c) of section 253 of this title and approved in accordance with subsection (f) of such section, competitive procedures shall be used for making such a modification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notice regarding the modification shall be provided in accordance with section 416 of this title and section 637(e) of title 15.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Contract extensions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the limitation on the contract period set forth in subsection (b) of this section or in a solicitation or contract pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, a contract entered into by the head of an executive agency under this section may be extended on a sole-source basis for a period not exceeding six months if the head of such executive agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the award of a follow-on contract has been delayed by circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the initial contract was entered into; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:73 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the extension is necessary in order to ensure continuity of the receipt of services pending the award of, and commencement of performance under, the follow-on contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A task order contract may be extended under the authority of paragraph (1) only once and only in accordance with the limitations and requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Inapplicability to certain contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply to a contract for the acquisition of property or services that includes acquisition of advisory and assistance services if the head of the executive agency entering into such contract determines that, under the contract, advisory and assistance services are necessarily incident to, and not a significant component of, the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Advisory and assistance services&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;advisory and assistance services&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 1105(g) of title 31.</p>
