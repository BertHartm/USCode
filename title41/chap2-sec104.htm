<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">In subsec. (d) of this section, &ldquo;chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1949&rdquo; on authority of Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 631, the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the second sentence of this section, provisions that authorized the appointment of a Deputy Director and that authorized the employment of certified public accountants, qualified cost accountants, industrial engineers, appraisers, and other experts without regard to &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1923&rdquo;, were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this sentence because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, Sept. 6, 1966, &sect;8(a), 80 Stat. 632 (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5 into law). Section 5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.</p>
