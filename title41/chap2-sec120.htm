<p class="statutory-body">Each contracting agency shall have authority, notwithstanding any provisions of law other than contained in this chapter, (1) to make any contract necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter; (2) to amend by agreement any existing contract, either before or after notice of its termination, on such terms and to such extent as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter; and (3) in settling any termination claim, to agree to assume, or indemnify the war contractor against, any claims by any person in connection with such termination claims or settlement. This subsection shall not limit or affect in any way any authority of any contracting agency under the First War Powers Act, 1941, or under any other statute.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Evidence required; conclusiveness of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may prescribe the amount and kind of evidence required to identify any person as a war contractor, or any contract, agreement, or purchase order as a war contract for any of the purposes of this chapter. Any determination so made that any person is a war contractor, or that any contract, agreement, or purchase order is a war contract, shall be final and conclusive for any of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for administering the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Impairment of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to impair or modify any war contract or any term or provision of any war contract or any assignment of any claim under a war contract, without the consent of the parties thereto, if the war contract, or the term, provision, or assignment thereof, is otherwise valid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Aid to war contractors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may authorize or direct its officers and employees, as a part of their official duties, to advise, aid, and assist war contractors in preparing and presenting termination claims, in obtaining interim financing, and in related matters, to such extent as it deems desirable. Such advice, aid, or assistance shall not constitute a violation of section 205 of title 18 or of any other law, provided the officer or employee does not receive therefor benefit or compensation of any kind, directly or indirectly, from any war contractor.</p>
