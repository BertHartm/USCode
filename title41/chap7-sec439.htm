<p class="statutory-body">(1) A function of an executive agency performed by 10 or more agency civilian employees may not be converted, in whole or in part, to performance by a contractor unless the conversion is based on the results of a public-private competition that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) examines the cost of performance of the function by agency civilian employees and the cost of performance of the function by one or more contractors to demonstrate whether converting to performance by a contractor will result in savings to the Government over the life of the contract, including&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) requires continued performance of the function by agency civilian employees unless the difference in the cost of performance of the function by a contractor compared to the cost of performance of the function by agency civilian employees would, over all performance periods required by the solicitation, be equal to or exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 10 percent of the personnel-related costs for performance of that function in the agency tender; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall, at least monthly during the development and preparation of the performance work statement and the management efficiency study used in making that determination, consult with civilian employees who will be affected by that determination and consider the views of such employees on the development and preparation of that statement and that study; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may consult with such employees on other matters relating to that determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) A certification that a proposed performance of the function by a contractor is not a result of a decision by an official of an executive agency to impose predetermined constraints or limitations on such employees in terms of man years, end strengths, full-time equivalent positions, or maximum number of employees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The report required under paragraph (1) shall include an examination of the potential economic effect of performance of the function by a contractor on&mdash;</p>
