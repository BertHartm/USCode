<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Basis for request</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under procedures the Administrator establishes, a person may request the Administrator to review a regulation relating to procurement on the basis that the regulation is inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(6), the text of 41:421(c)(6) (last sentence) is omitted because 41:407 was repealed by section 4305(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104&ndash;106, 110 Stat. 665).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words &ldquo;after 60 days after November 17, 1988&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(B), the words &ldquo;(as that term is defined in section 3502(11) of title 44)&rdquo; are omitted because chapter 35 of title 44 was amended generally by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Public Law 104&ndash;13, 109 Stat. 163) and 44:3502 no longer defines &ldquo;information collection request&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;information collection request&rdquo; is retained in this section of the revised title, however, because 44:ch. 35 still contains provisions about requests for collection of information.</p>
