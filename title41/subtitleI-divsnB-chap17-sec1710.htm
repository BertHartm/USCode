<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>When conversion to contractor performance is allowed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A function of an executive agency performed by 10 or more agency civilian employees may not be converted, in whole or in part, to performance by a contractor unless the conversion is based on the results of a public-private competition that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) creates an agency tender, including a most efficient organization plan, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A76, as implemented on May 29, 2003, or any successor circular;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) includes the issuance of a solicitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) determines whether the submitted offers meet the needs of the executive agency with respect to factors other than cost, including quality, reliability, and timeliness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) examines the cost of performance of the function by agency civilian employees and the cost of performance of the function by one or more contractors to demonstrate whether converting to performance by a contractor will result in savings to the Federal Government over the life of the contract, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the estimated cost to the Federal Government (based on offers received) for performance of the function by a contractor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the estimated cost to the Federal Government for performance of the function by agency civilian employees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an estimate of all other costs and expenditures that the Federal Government would incur because of the award of the contract;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) requires continued performance of the function by agency civilian employees unless the difference in the cost of performance of the function by a contractor compared to the cost of performance of the function by agency civilian employees would, over all <!-- PDFPage:37 -->performance periods required by the solicitation, be equal to or exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 10 percent of the personnel-related costs for performance of that function in the agency tender; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) $10,000,000; and</p>
