<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Director may, after full consultation with the Board, by rules and regulations, modify the plan criteria set forth under this part, if he finds, on the basis of experience, that such action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. The Director may also, with respect to any State, waive compliance with one or more of the plan criteria, upon certification by the State insurance authority that compliance is unnecessary or inadvisable under local conditions or State law.</p>
