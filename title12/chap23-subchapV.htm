<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Modify the boundaries of farm credit districts, with due regard for the farm credit needs of the country, as approved by the Board, with the concurrence of the district banks involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) Where necessary or appropriate to carry out the policy and objectives of this chapter, issue and approve amendments to Federal charters of institutions of the System; approve change in names of banks operating under this chapter; approve the merger of districts when agreed to by the district bank boards involved and by a majority vote of the voting stockholders and contributors to the guaranty funds of each bank for each of such districts, voting in the same manner as is provided in section 2279a of this title; approve mergers and any related activities as provided for in subchapter VII of this chapter; and approve the consolidation or division of the territories of institutions when agreed to by a majority vote of the voting stockholders or contributors to the guaranty fund of each of the institutions involved; and approve consolidations of boards of directors when agreed to by a majority vote of the voting stockholders or contributors to the guaranty fund of each of the institutions involved. In issuing charters and certificates of territory for district-wide mergers of associations where stockholders of one or more associations did not approve the merger, the charter of the new or merged association shall not include the territory of the disagreeing association or associations; charters issued during calendar year 1985 for district-wide new or merged associations which included the territory of a disagreeing association shall be revoked and reissued to exclude such territory, unless subsequently agreed to by the board of directors of such association or associations. The Farm Credit Administration Board shall ensure that disapproving associations (A) shall not be charged any assessment under this chapter at a rate higher than that charged other like associations in the district, and (B) shall be provided with financial services and assistance on the same basis as other like associations in the district (including, but not limited to, access to credit and rates of interest on loans and discounts) by a district Farm Credit bank to the association and its member-borrowers. The Farm Credit Administration Board, after consultation with the respective boards of directors of the affected banks, may require two or more banks operating under the same or different titles to merge if the Board determines that one of such banks has failed to meet its outstanding obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Farm Credit Administration shall not issue a charter to, or approve an amendment to the charter of, any institution of the Farm Credit System to operate under subchapter I or II of this chapter that would authorize the institution to exercise lending authority, whether directly or indirectly as an agent of a Farm Credit Bank, in a territory in which the charter of another such institution authorizes the other institution to exercise like authority, whether directly or indirectly as an agent of a Farm Credit Bank, except with the approval of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in a case affecting only the charter of one or more associations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) a majority of the shareholders (present and voting or voting by proxy) of each of the associations that would have like lending authority (whether directly or indirectly as an agent of a Farm Credit Bank) in any of that territory if the charter action were taken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a majority of the board of directors of the Farm Credit Bank with which the affected associations are affiliated; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a majority of the shareholders (present and voting or voting by proxy) of each of the banks that would have like lending authority in any of that territory if the charter action were taken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a majority vote of the boards of directors of each of the banks that would have like lending authority in any of that territory if the charter action were taken.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Subparagraph (B) shall apply only in those geographic areas where, due to the failure of a Federal intermediate credit bank to merge in accordance with section 410(a) of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (12 U.S.C. 2011 note), the Federal intermediate credit bank or its successor is chartered to provide short- and intermediate-term credit, and a neighboring Farm Credit Bank that is not the successor to the Federal intermediate credit bank is chartered to provide long-term credit, in the same geographic territory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Make annual reports directly to Congress on the condition of the System and its institutions, based on the examinations carried out under section 2254 of this title, and on the manner and extent to which the purposes and objectives of this chapter are being carried out and, from time to time, recommend directly legislative changes. The annual reports shall include a summary and analysis of the reports submitted to the Farm Credit Administration <!-- PDFPage:1275 -->by the Farm Credit Banks under section 2207(b) of this title relating to programs for serving young, beginning, and small farmers and ranchers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Approve the issuance of obligations of the System under subsections (c) and (d) of section 2153 of this title for the purpose of funding the authorized operations of the institutions of the System, and prescribe collateral therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Grant approvals provided for under this chapter either on a case-by-case basis or through regulations that confer approval on actions of Farm Credit System institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Establish standards for the System institutions with respect to loan security requirements and regulate the borrowing, repayment, and transfer of funds and equities between institutions of the System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Conduct loan and collateral security review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Regulate the preparation by System institutions and the dissemination to stockholders and investors of information on the financial condition and operations of such institutions, except that the requirements of the Farm Credit Administration governing the dissemination to stockholders of quarterly reports of System institutions may not be more burdensome or costly than the requirements applicable to national banks, and the Farm Credit Administration may not require any System institution to disclose in any report to stockholders information concerning the condition or classification of a loan&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Scope and frequency of examinations; power, authority, and liability of examiners</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except for Federal land bank associations, each institution of the System shall be examined by Farm Credit Administration examiners at such times as the Board may determine, but in no event less than once during each 18-month period. Each Federal land bank association shall be examined by Farm Credit Administration examiners at such times as the Farm Credit Administration Board may determine, except that each such association shall be examined at least once every three years. Such examinations may include, if appropriate, but are not limited to, an analysis of credit and collateral quality and capitalization of the institution, and appraisals of the effectiveness of the institution's management and application of policies governing the carrying out of this chapter and regulations of the Farm Credit Administration and servicing all eligible borrowers. Examination of banks shall include an analysis of the compensation paid to the chief executive officer and the salary scales of the employees of the bank. At the direction of the Board, Farm Credit Administration examiners also shall make examinations of the condition of any organization, other than federally regulated financial institutions, to, for, or with which any institution of the System contemplates making a loan or discounting paper. For the purposes of this chapter, examiners of the Farm Credit Administration shall be subject to the same requirements, responsibilities, and penalties as are applicable to examiners under the National Bank Act [12 U.S.C. 21 et seq.], the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 221 et seq.], and Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.], and other provisions of law and shall have the same powers and privileges as are vested in such examiners by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Annual report of condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each institution of the System shall make and publish an annual report of condition as prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration. Each such report shall contain financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except with respect to any actions taken by any banks of the System under section 2159(b) of this title, and <!-- PDFPage:1279 -->contain such additional information as the Farm Credit Administration by regulation may require. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence and any other provision of this chapter, for the period July 1, 1986, through December 31, 1988, the institutions of the Farm Credit System may, on the prior approval of the Farm Credit Administration and subject to such conditions as it may establish, capitalize annually their provision for losses that is in excess of one-half of 1 percent of loans outstanding and amortize such capitalized amounts over a period not to exceed 20 years. Such financial statements of System institutions shall be audited by an independent public accountant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In accordance with the regulations of the Farm Credit Administration, for the period ending December 31, 1992, System institutions are authorized to use the authorities contained in the third sentence of paragraph (1) except as otherwise provided in section 2278a&ndash;6 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any preferred stock issued under section 2278b&ndash;7 of this title shall be subordinated to, and impaired before, other stock or equities of the institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report of examination of noncomplying institution; publication; notice of intention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Farm Credit Administration may publish the report of examination of any System institution that does not, before the end of the 120th day after the date of notification of the recommendations and suggestions of the Farm Credit Administration, based on such examination, comply with such recommendations and suggestions to the satisfaction of the Farm Credit Administration. The Farm Credit Administration shall give notice of intention to publish in the event of such noncompliance at least 90 days before such publication. Such notice of intention may be given any time after such notification of recommendations and suggestions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Duties of Farm Credit Administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On receipt of a request made under section 2277a&ndash;8(b)(1)(B) of this title with respect to a System institution, the Farm Credit Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) furnish for the confidential use of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation reports of examination of the institution and other reports or information on the institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) examine, or obtain other information on, the institution and furnish for the confidential use of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation the report of the examination and such other information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Farm Credit Administration Board determines that compliance with the request would substantially impair the ability of the Farm Credit Administration to carry out the other duties and responsibilities of the Farm Credit Administration under this chapter, notify the Board of Directors of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation that the Farm Credit Administration will be unable to comply with the request.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 99&ndash;198, title XIII, &sect;1326, Dec. 23, 1985, 99 Stat. 1540, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) high production costs and low commodity prices have combined to reduce farm income to the lowest levels since the depths of the Depression in the 1930's, to subject many agricultural producers, through no fault of their own, to severe economic hardship, and in many cases temporarily but seriously to impair producers&rsquo; ability to meet loan repayment schedules in a timely fashion; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) a policy of adverse classification of agricultural loans by bank examiners under these circumstances will trigger a wave of foreclosures and similar actions on the part of banks, thereby depressing land values and prices for agricultural facilities and equipment and having a devastating effect on farmers and the banking industry, and upon rural areas of the United States in general.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) It is therefore the sense of Congress that the Federal bank regulatory agencies should ensure, in their examination procedures, that examiners exercise caution and restraint and give due consideration not only to the current cash flow of agricultural borrowers under financial stress, but to factors such as their loan collateral and ultimate ability to repay as well, for so long as the adverse economic effects of the cost-price squeeze of recent years continue to impair the ability of these borrowers to meet scheduled repayments on their loans.&rdquo;</p>

The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the institution or the director, officer, employee, agent, or <!-- PDFPage:1282 -->other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Farm Credit Administration at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease and desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Farm Credit Administration shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Farm Credit Administration may issue and serve upon the institution or the director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions that may be mandatory or otherwise, require the institution or its directors, officers, employees, agents, and other persons participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A cease and desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the institution or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease and desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Farm Credit Administration or a reviewing court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2265. Suspension or removal of director or officer charged with felony</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever any director or officer of an institution in the Farm Credit System, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution, is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney, with the commission of or participation in a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under State or Federal law, the Farm Credit Administration may, if continued service or participation by the individual may pose a threat to the interests of the institution's shareholders or investors in Farm Credit System obligations or threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System, by written notice served upon such director, officer, or other person, suspend such director, officer, or other person from office or prohibit such director, officer, or other person from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution. A copy of such notice shall also be served upon the institution. Such suspension or prohibition shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of or until terminated by the Farm Credit Administration. In the event that a judgment of conviction with respect to such crime is entered against such director, officer, or other person, and at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Farm Credit Administration may, if continued service or participation by the individual may pose a threat to the interests of the institution's shareholders or the investors in Farm Credit System obligations or may threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System, issue and serve upon such director, officer, or other person an order removing such director, officer, or other person from office or prohibiting such director, officer, or other person from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution except with the consent of the Farm Credit Administration. A copy of such order shall also be served upon such institution, whereupon such director or officer shall cease to be a director or officer of such institution. A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Farm Credit Administration from thereafter instituting proceedings to remove such director, officer, or other person from office or to prohibit further participation in Farm Credit System affairs under section 2264 of this title. Any notice of suspension or order of removal issued under this paragraph shall remain effective and outstanding until the completion of any hearing or appeal authorized under subsection (b) of this section unless terminated by the Farm Credit Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Within thirty days from service of any notice of suspension or order of removal issued <!-- PDFPage:1285 -->under subsection (a) of this section, the director, officer, or other person concerned may request in writing an opportunity to appear before the Farm Credit Administration to show that the continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the institution by such individual does not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interest of the institution's shareholders or the investors in Farm Credit System obligations or threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System. Upon receipt of any such request, the Farm Credit Administration shall fix a time (not more than thirty days after receipt of such request, unless extended at the request of the concerned director, officer, or other person) and place at which the director, officer, or other person may appear, personally or through counsel, before the Chairman of the Farm Credit Administration or designated employees of the Farm Credit Administration to submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the Farm Credit Administration, oral testimony) and oral argument. Within sixty days of such hearing, the Farm Credit Administration shall notify the director, officer, or other person whether the suspension or prohibition from participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution will be continued, terminated, or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such director, officer, or other person from office or prohibiting such individual from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution will be rescinded or otherwise modified. Such notification shall contain a statement of the basis for the Farm Credit Administration's decision, if adverse to the director, officer, or other person. The Farm Credit Administration may prescribe such rules as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any hearing provided for in this part (other than the hearing provided for in section 2265 of this title) shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in the territory in which the home office of the institution is located unless the party afforded the hearing consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5. Such hearing shall be private, unless the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, after fully considering the views of the party afforded the hearing, determines that a public hearing is necessary to protect the public interest. After such hearing, and within ninety days after the Farm Credit Administration has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to it for final decision, it shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this part. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this section. Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided in subsection (b) of this section, and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as so provided, the Farm Credit Administration may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon such filing of the record, the Farm Credit Administration may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial review; commencement of proceedings; filing of petition and record; exclusive jurisdiction; finality of judgment and decree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any party to the proceeding, or any person required by an order issued under this part to cease and desist from any of the violations or practices stated therein, may obtain a review of any order served under subsection (a) of this section (other than an order issued with the consent of the System institution or the director or officer or other person concerned, or an order issued under section 2265 of this title) by the filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the home office of the institution is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within thirty days after the date of service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Farm Credit Administration be <!-- PDFPage:1286 -->modified, terminated, or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Farm Credit Administration, and thereupon the Farm Credit Administration shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall except as provided in the last sentence of subsection (a) of this section be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Farm Credit Administration. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5.

<p class="statutory-body">Any institution in the System that violates or any officer, director, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution who violates the terms of any order that has become final and was issued under section 2261 or 2262 of this title, shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 per day for each day during which such violation continues. Any such institution or person who violates any provision of this chapter or any regulation issued under this chapter shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than $500 per day for each day during which such violation continues. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Farm Credit Administration may, in its discretion, compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty that is subject to imposition or has been imposed under such authority. The penalty may be assessed and collected by the Farm Credit Administration by written notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors determining amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before determining whether to assess a civil money penalty and determining the amount of such penalty, the Farm Credit Administration shall notify the institution or person to be assessed of the violation or violations alleged to have occurred or to be occurring, and shall solicit the views of the institution or person regarding the imposition of such penalty. In determining the amount of the penalty, the Farm Credit Administration shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of financial resources and good faith of the System institution or person charged, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice and hearing; final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The System institution or person assessed shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the Farm Credit Administration, upon request made within ten days after issuance of the notice of assessment.

The Farm Credit Adminis<!-- PDFPage:1287 -->tration determination shall be made by final order which may be reviewed only as provided in subsection (d) of this section. If no hearing is requested as herein provided, the assessment shall constitute a final and unappealable order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any System institution or person against whom an order imposing a civil money penalty has been entered after a Farm Credit Administration hearing under this section may obtain review by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the home office of the System institution is located, or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, by filing a notice of appeal in such court within twenty days after the service of such order, and simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by registered or certified mail to the Farm Credit Administration. The Farm Credit Administration shall promptly certify and file in such Court the record upon which the penalty was imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Final orders of the Farm Credit Administration issued under subsection (c) of this section shall be reviewable under chapter 7 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Action by Attorney General to recover amount assessed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any System institution or person fails to pay an assessment after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the court of appeals has entered final judgment in favor of the Farm Credit Administration, the Farm Credit Administration shall refer the matter to the Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed by action in the appropriate United States district court. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount in Fund not exceeding secure base amount</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If at the end of any calendar year the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund does not exceed the secure base amount, subject to paragraph (2), the annual premium due from any insured System bank for the calendar year shall be equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annual average principal outstanding for such year on loans made by the bank that are in accrual status, excluding the guaranteed portions of government-guaranteed loans provided for in subparagraph (C), multiplied by 0.0015;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the annual average principal outstanding for such year on loans made by the bank that are in nonaccrual status, multiplied by 0.0025; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) the annual average principal outstanding for such year on the guaranteed portions of Federal Government-guaranteed loans made by the bank that are in accrual status, multiplied by 0.00015; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the annual average principal outstanding for such year on the guaranteed portions of State government-guaranteed loans made by the bank that are in accrual status, multiplied by 0.0003.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduced premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation, in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may reduce by a percentage uniformly applied to all insured System banks the annual premium due from each insured System bank during any calendar year, as determined under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Government-guaranteed loans&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this section and section 2020(b) of this title, the term &ldquo;government-guaranteed loans&rdquo; means loans or credits, or portions of loans or credits, that are guaranteed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by the full faith and credit of the United States Government or any State government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by an agency or other entity of the United States Government whose obligations are explicitly guaranteed by the United States Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by an agency or other entity of a State government whose obligations are explicitly guaranteed by such State government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount in Fund exceeding secure base amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the secure base amount, the Corporation shall reduce the annual premium due from each insured System bank, as determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section, by a percentage determined by the Corporation so that the aggregate of the premiums payable by all System banks is sufficient to ensure that the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund after such premiums are paid is not less than the secure base amount at such time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Secure base amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;secure base amount&rdquo; means, with respect to any point in time, 2 percent of the aggregate outstanding insured obligations of all insured System banks at such time (adjusted downward to exclude an amount equal to the sum of (1) 90 percent of the guaranteed portions of principal outstanding on Federal Government-guaranteed loans in accrual status made by such banks and (2) 80 percent of the guaranteed portions of principal outstanding on State government-guaranteed loans in accrual status made by such banks, as determined by the Corporation), or such other percentage of the aggregate amount as the Corporation in its sole discretion determines is actuarially sound to maintain in the Insurance Fund taking into account the risk of insuring outstanding insured obligations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of principal outstanding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of subsections (a), (c), and (e) of this section, the principal outstanding on all <!-- PDFPage:1292 -->loans made by an insured System bank shall be determined based on all loans made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by any production credit association, or any other association making direct loans under authority provided under section 2279b of this title, that is able to make such loans because such association is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by any bank, company, institution, corporation, union, or association described in section 2015(b)(1)(B) of this title, that is able to make such loans because such entity is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by such insured System bank (other than loans made to any party described in paragraph (1) or (2)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allocation to System institutions of excess reserves</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for each insured System bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subject to paragraph (6)(C), for all holders, in the aggregate, of Financial Assistance Corporation stock.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts in any Allocated Insurance Reserves Account shall be considered to be part of the Farm Credit Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, at the end of any calendar year, the aggregate of the amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the average secure base amount for the calendar year (as calculated on an average daily balance basis), the Corporation shall allocate to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts the excess amount less the amount that the Corporation, in its sole discretion, determines to be the sum of the estimated operating expenses and estimated insurance obligations of the Corporation for the immediately succeeding calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Allocation formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the total amount required to be allocated at the end of a calendar year under paragraph (3)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 10 percent of the total amount shall be credited to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account established under paragraph (1)(B), subject to paragraph (6)(C); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there shall be credited to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account of each insured System bank an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount (less any amount credited under subparagraph (A)) as the average principal outstanding for the 3-year period ending on the end of the calendar year on loans made by the bank that are in accrual status bears to the average principal outstanding for the 3-year period ending on the end of the calendar year on loans made by all insured System banks that are in accrual status (excluding, in each case, the guaranteed portions of government-guaranteed loans described in subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Use of funds in Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the sum of the operating expenses of the Corporation and the insurance obligations of the Corporation for a calendar year exceeds the sum of operating expenses and insurance obligations determined under paragraph (3) for the calendar year, the Corporation shall cover the expenses and obligations by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reducing each Allocated Insurance Reserves Account by the same proportion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expending the amounts obtained under subparagraph (A) before expending other amounts in the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Other disposition of Account funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As soon as practicable during each calendar year beginning more than 8 years after the date on which the aggregate of the amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the secure base amount, but not earlier than January 1, 2005, the Corporation may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subject to subparagraphs (D) and (F), pay to each insured System bank, in a manner determined by the Corporation, an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 20 percent of the balance in the insured System bank's Allocated Insurance Reserves Account as of the preceding December 31; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 20 percent of the balance in the bank's Allocated Insurance Reserves Account on the date of the payment; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subject to subparagraphs (C), (E), and (F), pay to each System bank and association holding Financial Assistance Corporation stock a proportionate share, determined by dividing the number of shares of Financial Assistance Corporation stock held by the institution by the total number of shares of Financial Assistance Corporation stock outstanding, of the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 20 percent of the balance in the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account established under paragraph (1)(B) as of the preceding December 31; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 20 percent of the balance in the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account established under paragraph (1)(B) on the date of the payment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Authority to eliminate or reduce payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation may eliminate or reduce payments during a calendar year under subparagraph (A) if the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that the payments, or other circumstances that might require use of the Farm Credit Insurance Fund, could cause the amount in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund during the calendar year to be less than the secure base amount.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1293 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reimbursement for Financial Assistance Corporation stock</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Sufficient funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding paragraph (4)(A), on provision by the Corporation for the accumulation in the Account established under paragraph (1)(B) of funds in an amount equal to $56,000,000 (in addition to the amounts described in subparagraph (F)(ii)), the Corporation shall not allocate any further funds to the Account except to replenish the Account if funds are diminished below $56,000,000 by the Corporation under paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Wind down and termination</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) Final disbursements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">On disbursement of $53,000,000 (in addition to the amounts described in subparagraph (F)(ii)) from the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account, the Corporation shall disburse the remaining amounts in the Account, as determined under subparagraph (A)(ii), without regard to the percentage limitations in subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Termination of Account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">On disbursement of $56,000,000 (in addition to the amounts described in subparagraph (F)(ii)) from the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account, the Corporation shall close the Account established under paragraph (1)(B) and transfer any remaining funds in the Account to the remaining Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts in accordance with paragraph (4)(B) for the calendar year in which the transfer occurs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Distribution of payments received</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 60 days after receipt of a payment made under subparagraph (A)(i), each insured System bank, in consultation with affiliated associations of the insured System bank, and taking into account the direct or indirect payment of insurance premiums by the associations, shall develop and implement an equitable plan to distribute payments received under subparagraph (A)(i) among the bank and associations of the bank.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Exception for previously reimbursed associations</h4>
