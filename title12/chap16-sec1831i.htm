<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disapproval by agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An insured depository institution or depository institution holding company may not add any individual to the board of directors or employ any individual as a senior executive officer if the appropriate Federal banking agency issues a notice of disapproval of such addition or employment before the end of the notice period, not to exceed 90 days, beginning on the date the agency receives notice of the proposed action pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
