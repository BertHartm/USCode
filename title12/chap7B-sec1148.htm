Such corporations shall be managed by officers and agents to be appointed by the Farm Credit Administration under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe. Such corporations are authorized and empowered to make loans or advances to farmers and stockmen, the proceeds of which are to be used for an agricultural purpose (including crop production), or for the raising, breeding, fattening, or marketing of livestock, to charge such rates of interest or discount thereon as in their judgment are fair and equitable, subject to the approval of the Farm Credit Administration, and to rediscount with the Farm Credit Administration and the various Federal reserve banks and Federal intermediate credit banks any paper that they acquire which is eligible for such purpose. All expenses incurred in connection with the operation of such corporations shall be supervised and paid by the Farm Credit Administration under such rules and regulations as its board of directors may prescribe.</p>
