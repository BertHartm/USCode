A participating State may use the Federal contribution to make its contribution to the reserve fund of an approved State capital access program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Minimum program requirements for State capital access programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, by regulation or other guidance, prescribe Program requirements that meet the following minimum requirements:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Loan terms and conditions to be determined by agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan to be filed for enrollment in an approved State capital access program may be made with such interest rate, fees, and other terms and conditions, and the loan may be enrolled in the approved State capital access program and claims may be filed and paid, as <!-- PDFPage:1999 -->agreed upon by the financial institution lender and the borrower, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Lender capital at-risk</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Particular loan purpose requirements and prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In connection with the filing of a loan for enrollment in an approved State capital access program, the financial institution lender&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall obtain an assurance from each borrower that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the proceeds of the loan will be used for a business purpose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the loan will not be used to finance such business activities as the Secretary, by regulation, may proscribe as prohibited loan purposes for enrollment in an approved State capital access program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the borrower is not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the financial institution lender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) a member of the immediate family of an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the financial institution lender; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall provide assurances to the participating State that the loan has not been made in order to place under the protection of the approved State capital access program prior debt that is not covered under the approved State capital access program and that is or was owed by the borrower to the financial institution lender or to an affiliate of the financial institution lender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not allow the enrollment of a loan to a borrower that is a refinancing of a loan previously made to that borrower by the financial institution lender or an affiliate of the financial institution lender; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) may include additional restrictions on the eligibility of loans or borrowers that are not inconsistent with the provisions and purposes of this chapter, including compliance with all applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, ordinances, and Executive orders.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Capital access for small businesses in underserved communities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the time that a State applies to the Secretary to have the State capital access program approved as eligible for Federal contributions, the State shall deliver to the Secretary a report stating how the State plans to use the Federal contributions to the reserve fund to provide access to capital for small businesses in low- and moderate-income, minority, and other underserved communities, including women- and minority-owned small businesses.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall approve such State other credit support program as eligible for Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the program if&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:2000 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility criteria for State other credit support programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For a State other credit support program to be approved under this section, that program shall be required to be a program of the State that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) can demonstrate that, at a minimum, $1 of public investment by the State program will cause and result in $1 of new private credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) can demonstrate a reasonable expectation that, when considered with all other State programs of the State, such State programs together have the ability to use amounts of new Federal contributions to, or for the account of, all such programs in the State to cause and result in amounts of new small business lending at least 10 times the new Federal contribution amount;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for those State other credit support programs that provide their credit support through 1 or more financial institution lenders, requires the financial institution lenders to have a meaningful amount of their own capital resources at risk in their small business lending; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) does not extend credit support to loans that exceed a principal amount of $20,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The operational capacity, skills, and experience of the management team of the State other credit support program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The capacity of the State other credit support program to manage increases in the volume of its small business lending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The internal accounting and administrative controls systems of the State other credit support program, and the extent to which they can provide reasonable assurance that funds of the State program are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The soundness of the program design and implementation plan of the State other credit support program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal contributions to approved State other credit support programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State other credit support program approved under this section will be eligible for receiving Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the State program in an amount consistent with the schedule describing the apportionment of allocated Federal funds among State programs delivered by the State to the Secretary under the allocation agreement.</p>
