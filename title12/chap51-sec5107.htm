<p class="statutory-body">If, by the end of the 1-year period, or the 2-year period in the case of a State whose legislature meets only biennially, beginning on July 30, 2008, or at any time thereafter, the Secretary determines that a State does not have in place by law or regulation a system for licensing and registering loan originators that meets the re<!-- PDFPage:1789 -->quirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title and subsection (d) of this section, or does not participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, the Secretary shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a system for the licensing and registration by the Secretary of loan originators operating in such State as State-licensed loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Licensing and registration requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The system established by the Secretary under subsection (a) for any State shall meet the requirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title for State-licensed loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unique identifier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall coordinate with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to establish protocols for assigning a unique identifier to each loan originator licensed by the Secretary as a State-licensed loan originator that will facilitate electronic tracking and uniform identification of, and public access to, the employment history of and the publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State licensing law requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the law in effect in a State meets the requirements of this subsection if the Secretary determines the law satisfies the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A State loan originator supervisory authority is maintained to provide effective supervision and enforcement of such law, including the suspension, termination, or nonrenewal of a license for a violation of State or Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The State loan originator supervisory authority ensures that all State-licensed loan originators operating in the State are registered with Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The State loan originator supervisory authority is required to regularly report violations of such law, as well as enforcement actions and other relevant information, to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The State loan originator supervisory authority has a process in place for challenging information contained in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The State loan originator supervisory authority has established a mechanism to assess civil money penalties for individuals acting as mortgage originators in their State without a valid license or registration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The State loan originator supervisory authority has established minimum net worth or surety bonding requirements that reflect the dollar amount of loans originated by a residential mortgage loan originator, or has established a recovery fund paid into by the loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Temporary extension of period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may extend, by not more than 24 months, the 1-year or 2-year period, as the case may be, referred to in subsection (a) for the licensing of loan originators in any State under a State licensing law that meets the requirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title and subsection (d) if the Secretary determines that such State is making a good faith effort to establish a State licensing law that meets such requirements, license mortgage originators under such law, and register such originators with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
