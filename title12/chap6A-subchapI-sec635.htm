<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is created a corporation with the name Export-Import Bank of the United States, which shall be an agency of the United States of America. The objects and purposes of the bank shall be to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports and the exchange of commodities and services between the United States or any of its Territories or insular possessions and any foreign country or the agencies or nationals thereof. In connection with and in furtherance of its objects and purposes, the bank is authorized and empowered to do a general banking business except that of circulation; to receive deposits; to purchase, discount, rediscount, sell, and negotiate, with or without its endorsement or guaranty, and to guarantee notes, drafts, checks, bills of exchange, acceptances, including bankers&rsquo; acceptances, cable transfers, and other evidences of indebtedness; to guarantee, insure, coinsure, and reinsure against political and credit risks of loss; to purchase, sell, and guarantee securities but not to purchase with its funds any stock in any other corporation except that it may acquire any such stock through the enforcement of any lien or pledge or otherwise to satisfy a previously contracted indebtedness to it; to accept bills and drafts drawn upon it; to issue letters of credit; to purchase and sell coin, bullion, and exchange; to borrow and to lend money; to perform any act herein authorized in participation with any other person, including any individual, partnership, corporation, or association; to adopt, alter, and use a corporate seal, which shall be judicially noticed; to sue and to be sued, to complain and to defend in any court of competent jurisdiction; to represent itself or to contract for representation in all legal and arbitral proceedings outside the United States; and the enumeration of the foregoing powers shall not be deemed to exclude other powers necessary to the achievement of the objects and purposes of the bank. The bank shall be entitled to the use of the United States mails in the same manner and upon the same conditions as the executive departments of the Government. The Bank is authorized to publish or arrange for the publication of any documents, reports, contracts, or other material necessary in connection with or in furtherance of its objects and purposes without regard to the provisions of section 501 of title 44 whenever the Bank determines that publication in accordance with the provisions of such section would not be practicable. Subject to regulations which the Bank shall issue pursuant to section 553 of title 5, the Bank may impose and collect reasonable fees to cover the costs of conferences and seminars sponsored by, and publications provided by, the Bank, and may accept reimbursement for travel and subsistence expenses incurred by a director, officer, or employee of the Bank, in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5. Amounts received under the preceding sentence shall be credited to the fund which initially paid for such activities and shall be offset against the expenses of the Bank for such activities. The bank is authorized to use all of its assets and all moneys which have been or may hereafter be allocated to or borrowed by it in the exercise of its functions. Net earnings of the bank after reasonable provision for possible losses shall be used for payment of dividends on capital stock. Any such dividends shall be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order for the Bank to be competitive in all of its financing programs with countries whose exports compete with United States exports, the Bank shall establish a program that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provides medium-term financing where necessary to be fully competitive&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) at rates of interest to the customer which are equal to rates established in international agreements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in amounts up to 85 percent of the total cost of the exports involved; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) enables the Bank to cooperate fully with the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to develop a program for purposes of disseminating information (using existing private in<!-- PDFPage:183 -->stitutions) to small business concerns regarding the medium-term financing provided under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Enhancement of Medium-Term Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To enhance the medium-term financing program established pursuant to paragraph (2), the Bank shall establish measures to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) improve the competitiveness of the Bank's medium-term financing and ensure that its medium-term financing is fully competitive with that of other major official export credit agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ease the administrative burdens and procedural and documentary requirements imposed on the users of medium-term financing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) attract the widest possible participation of private financial institutions and other sources of private capital in the medium-term financing of United States exports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) render the Bank's medium-term financing as supportive of United States exports as is its Direct Loan Program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guarantees, insurance, and extension of credit functions; competitive with Government-supported rates and terms and conditions of foreign exporting countries; survey and report; interest rates; private capital encouragement; national interest determinations; delivery of United States services in international commerce; small business concern encouragement; coverage of losses by Foreign Credit Insurance Association; loans to Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for fossil fuel research, etc.; nuclear safeguards violations resulting in limitations on exports and credit; defense article credit sales to less developed countries; amount outstanding; supplementation of Commodity Credit Corporation programs; limitations on authority of Bank; prohibition relating to Angola</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) It is the policy of the United States to foster expansion of exports of manufactured goods, agricultural products, and other goods and services, thereby contributing to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the increased development of the productive resources of the United States. To meet this objective in all its programs, the Export-Import Bank is directed, in the exercise of its functions, to provide guarantees, insurance, and extensions of credit at rates and on terms and other conditions which are fully competitive with the Government-supported rates and terms and other conditions available for the financing of exports of goods and services from the principal countries whose exporters compete with United States exporters. The Bank shall, in cooperation with the export financing instrumentalities of other governments, seek to minimize competition in government-supported export financing and shall, in cooperation with other appropriate United States Government agencies, seek to reach international agreements to reduce government subsidized export financing. The Bank shall, on a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#635_1_target" name="635_1">1</a></sup> annual basis, report to the appropriate committees of Congress its actions in complying with these directives. In this report the Bank shall include a survey of all other major export-financing facilities available from other governments and government-related agencies through which foreign exporters compete with the United States exporters and indicate in specific terms the ways in which the Bank's rates, terms, and other conditions compare with those offered from such other governments directly or indirectly. Further, the Bank shall at the same time survey a representative number of United States exporters and United States commercial lending institutions which provide export credit to determine their experience in meeting financial competition from other countries whose exporters compete with United States exporters. The results of this survey shall be included as part of the annual report required by this subparagraph. The Bank shall include in the annual report a description of its role in the implementation of the strategic plan prepared by the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee in accordance with section 4727 of title 15.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) It is further the policy of the United States that loans made by the Bank in all its programs shall bear interest at rates determined by the Board of Directors, consistent with the Bank's mandate to support United States exports at rates and on terms and conditions which are fully competitive with exports of other countries, and consistent with international agreements. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, rates and terms and conditions need not be identical in all respects to those offered by foreign countries, but should be established so that the effect of such rates, terms, and conditions for all the Bank's programs, including those for small businesses and for medium-term financing, will be to neutralize the effect of such foreign credit on international sales competition. The Bank shall consider its average cost of money as one factor in its determination of interest rates, where such consideration does not impair the Bank's primary function of expanding United States exports through fully competitive financing. The Bank may not impose a credit application fee unless (i) the fee is competitive with the average fee charged by the Bank's primary foreign competitors, and (ii) the borrower or the exporter is given the option of paying the fee at the outset of the loan or over the life of the loan and the present value of the fee determined under either such option is the same amount. It is also the policy of the United States that the Bank in the exercise of its functions should supplement and encourage, and not compete with, private capital; that the Bank, in determining whether to provide support for a transaction under the loan, guarantee, or insurance program, or any combination thereof, shall consider the need to involve private capital in support of United States exports as well as the cost of the transaction as calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.]; that the Bank shall accord equal opportunity to export agents and managers, independent export firms, export trading companies, and small commercial banks in the formulation and implementation of its programs; that the Bank should give emphasis to assisting new and small business entrants in the agricultural export market, <!-- PDFPage:184 -->and shall, in cooperation with other relevant Government agencies, including the Commodity Credit Corporation, develop a program of education to increase awareness of export opportunities among small agribusinesses and cooperatives; that loans, so far as possible consistent with the carrying out of the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, shall generally be for specific purposes, and, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, offer reasonable assurance of repayment; and that in authorizing any loan or guarantee, the Board of Directors shall take into account any serious adverse effect of such loan or guarantee on the competitive position of United States industry, the availability of materials which are in short supply in the United States, and employment in the United States, and shall give particular emphasis to the objective of strengthening the competitive position of United States exporters and thereby of expanding total United States exports. Only in cases where the President determines that such action would be in the national interest where such action would clearly and importantly advance United States policy in such areas as international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, environmental protection and human rights, should the Export-Import Bank deny applications for credit for nonfinancial or noncommercial considerations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Consistent with the policy of section 3261 of title 22 and section 2151q&nbsp;<sup><a href="#635_2_target" name="635_2">2</a></sup> of title 22, the Board of Directors shall name an officer of the Bank whose duties shall include advising the President of the Bank on ways of promoting the export of goods and services to be used in the development, production, and distribution of nonnuclear renewable energy resources, disseminating information concerning export opportunities and the availability of Bank support for such activities, and acting as a liaison between the Bank and the Department of Commerce and other appropriate departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) It is further the policy of the United States to foster the delivery of United States services in international commerce. In exercising its powers and functions, the Bank shall give full and equal consideration to making loans and providing guarantees for the export of services (independently, or in conjunction with the export of manufactured goods, equipment, hardware or other capital goods) consistent with the Bank's policy to neutralize foreign subsidized credit competition and to supplement the private capital market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Bank shall include in its annual report a summary of its programs regarding the export of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i)(I) It is further the policy of the United States to encourage the participation of small business in international commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) In exercising its authority, the Bank shall develop a program which gives fair consideration to making loans and providing guarantees for the export of goods and services by small businesses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) It is further the policy of the United States that the Bank shall give due recognition to the policy stated in section 631(a) of title 15 that &ldquo;the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In furtherance of this policy, the Board of Directors shall designate an officer of the Bank who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) shall be responsible to the President of the Bank for all matters concerning or affecting small business concerns; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) among other duties, shall be responsible for advising small business concerns of the opportunities for small business concerns in the functions of the Bank and for maintaining liaison with the Small Business Administration and other departments and agencies in matters affecting small business concerns.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Director appointed to represent the interests of small business under section 635a(c) of this title shall ensure that the Bank carries out its responsibilities under clauses (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph and that the Bank's financial and other resources are, to the maximum extent possible, appropriately used for small business needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) To assure that the purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph are carried out, the Bank shall make available, from the aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance authority available to it, an amount to finance exports directly by small business concerns (as defined under section 632 of title 15) which shall be not less than 10 percent of such authority for each fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) The Bank shall utilize the amount set aside pursuant to clause (v) of this subparagraph to offer financing for small business exports on terms which are fully competitive with regard to interest rates and with regard to the portion of financing which may be provided, guaranteed, or insured. Financing under this clause (vi) shall be available without regard to whether financing for the particular transaction was disapproved by any other Federal agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii)(I) The Bank shall utilize a part of the amount set aside pursuant to clause (v) to provide lines of credit or guarantees to consortia of small or medium size banks, export trading companies, State export finance agencies, export financing cooperatives, small business investment companies (as defined in section 662 of title 15), or other financing institutions or entities in order to finance small business exports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) Financing under this clause (vii) shall be made available only where the consortia or the participating institutions agree to undertake processing, servicing, and credit evaluation functions in connection with such financing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) To the maximum extent practicable, the Bank shall delegate to the consortia the authority to approve financing under this clause (vii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) In the administration of the program under this clause (vii), the Bank shall provide appropriate technical assistance to participating consortia and may require such consortia periodically to furnish information to the Bank regarding the number and amount of loans made and the creditworthiness of the borrowers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) In order to assure that the policy stated in clause (i) is carried out, the Bank shall promote small business exports and its small busi<!-- PDFPage:185 -->ness export financing programs in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Office of International Trade of the Small Business Administration, and the private sector, particularly small business organizations, State agencies, chambers of commerce, banking organizations, export management companies, export trading companies, and private industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ix) The Bank shall provide, through creditworthy trade associations, export trading companies, State export finance companies, export finance cooperatives, and other multiple-exporter organizations, medium-term risk protection coverage for the members and clients of such organizations. Such coverage shall be made available to each such organization under a single risk protection policy covering its members or clients. Nothing in this provision shall be interpreted as limiting the Bank's authority to deny support for specific transactions or to disapprove a request by such an organization to participate in such coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Consistent with international agreements, the Bank shall urge the Foreign Credit Insurance Association to provide coverage against 100 per centum of any loss with respect to exports having a value of less than $100,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Participation in or access to long-, medium-, and short-term financing, guarantees, and insurance provided by the Bank shall not be denied solely because the entity seeking participation or access is not a bank or is not a United States person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) It is further the policy of the United States to foster the development of democratic institutions and market economies in countries seeking such development, and to assist the export of high technology items to such countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In exercising its authority, the Bank shall develop a program for providing guarantees and insurance with respect to the export of high technology items to countries making the transition to market based economies, including eligible East European countries (within the meaning of section 4&nbsp;<sup><a href="#635_3_target" name="635_3">3</a></sup> of the Support For East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) As part of the ongoing marketing and outreach efforts of the Bank, the Bank shall, to the maximum extent practicable, inform high technology companies, particularly small business concerns (as such term is defined in section 632 of title 15), about the programs of the Bank for United States companies interested in exporting high technology goods to countries making the transition to market based economies, including any eligible East European country (within the meaning of section 4&nbsp;<sup><a href="#635_3_target" name="635_3">3</a></sup> of the Support For East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In carrying out clause (iii), the Bank shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) work with other agencies involved in export promotion and finance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) invite State and local governments, trade centers, commercial banks, and other appropriate public and private organizations to serve as intermediaries for the outreach efforts.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12166, Oct. 19, 1979, 44 F.R. 60971, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 2(b)(1)(B) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12 U.S.C. 635(b)(1)(B)), and by Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;101. The function vested in the President by Section 2(b)(1)(B) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12 U.S.C. 635(b)(1)(B)), is delegated to the Secretary of State. That function is the authority to determine that a denial by the Export-Import Bank of an application for credit would be in the national interest, where such action could clearly and importantly advance United States policy in such areas as international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, environmental protection and human rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;102. Before making such a determination, the Secretary of State shall consult with the Secretary of Commerce and the heads of other interested Executive agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;103. In accord with Section 2(b)(1)(B) of that Act, only in those cases where the Secretary of State has made such a determination should the Export-Import Bank deny an application for credit for nonfinancial or noncommercial considerations.</p>
