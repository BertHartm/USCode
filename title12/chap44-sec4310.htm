<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Class action awards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the amount of any award in any class action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the number of persons adversely affected; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A depository institution may not be held liable in any action brought under this section for a violation of this chapter if the depository institution demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error, notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Examples</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Examples of a bona fide error include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to a depository institution's obligation under this chapter is not a bona fide error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) No liability for overpayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A depository institution may not be held liable in any action under this section for a violation of this chapter if the violation has resulted in&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reliance on Board rulings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any regulation or order, or any interpretation of any regulation or order, of the Board, or in conformity with any interpretation or approval by an official or employee of the Board duly authorized by the <!-- PDFPage:1474 -->Board to issue such interpretation or approval under procedures prescribed by the Board, notwithstanding, the fact that after such act or omission has occurred, such regulation, order, interpretation, or approval is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Notification of and adjustment for errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A depository institution shall not be liable under this section or section 4309 of this title for any failure to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter with respect to any account if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the depository institution discovered the failure to comply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any action is instituted against the depository institution by the account holder under this section with respect to such failure to comply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any written notice of such failure to comply is received by the depository institution from the account holder,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the depository institution notifies the account holder of the failure of such institution to comply with such requirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the depository institution makes such adjustments as may be necessary with respect to such account to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the account holder will not be liable for any amount in excess of the amount actually disclosed with respect to any fee or charge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the account holder will not be liable for any fee or charge imposed under any condition not actually disclosed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) interest on amounts in such account will accrue at the annual percentage yield, and under the conditions, actually disclosed (and credit will be provided for interest already accrued at a different annual percentage yield and under different conditions than the yield or conditions disclosed).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Multiple interests in 1 account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If more than 1 person holds an interest in any account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the minimum and maximum amounts of liability under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section for any failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter shall apply with respect to such account; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the court shall determine the manner in which the amount of any such liability with respect to such account shall be distributed among such persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Continuing failure to disclose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Certain continuing failures treated as 1 violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the continuing failure of any depository institution to disclose any particular term required to be disclosed under this chapter with respect to a particular account shall be treated as a single violation for purposes of determining the amount of any liability of such institution under subsection (a) of this section for such failure to disclose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Subsequent failure to disclose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The continuing failure of any depository institution to disclose any particular term required to be disclosed under this chapter with respect to a particular account after judgment has been rendered in favor of the account holder in connection with a prior failure to disclose such term with respect to such account shall be treated as a subsequent violation for purposes of determining liability under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Coordination with section 4309 of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not limit or otherwise affect the enforcement power under section 4309 of this title of any agency referred to in subsection (a) of such section.</p>
