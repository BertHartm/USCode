<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that adequate records maintained by insured depository institutions have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings. The Congress further finds that microfilm or other reproductions and other records made by banks&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1829b_1_target" name="1829b_1">1</a></sup> of checks, as well as records kept by banks&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1829b_1_target" name="1829b_1">1</a></sup> of the identity of persons maintaining or authorized to act with respect to accounts therein, have been of particular value in this respect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is the purpose of this section to require the maintenance of appropriate types of records by insured depository institutions in the United States where such records have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recordkeeping regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) determines that the maintenance of appropriate types of records and other evidence by insured depository institutions has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, he shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Domestic funds transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) determine that the maintenance of records, by insured depository institutions, of payment orders which direct transfers of funds over wholesale funds transfer systems has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, the Secretary and the Board shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section with respect to the maintenance of such records.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) International funds transfers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) involve international transactions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) direct transfers of funds over wholesale funds transfer systems or on the books of any insured depository institution, or on the books of any business that provides check cashing services, any money transmitting business, and any business that issues or redeems money orders, travelers&rsquo; checks or similar instruments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">that will have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a record of each check, draft, or similar instrument received by it for deposit or collection, together with an identification of the party for whose account it is to be deposited or collected, unless the insured depository institution has already made a record of the party's identity pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Identity of persons making reportable currency and foreign transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the requirements of any regulations prescribed jointly by the Secretary and the Board under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (b) of this section, whenever any individual engages (whether as principal, agent, or bailee) in any transaction with an insured depository institution which is required to be reported or recorded under subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, the insured depository institution shall require and retain such evidence of the identity of that individual as the Secretary may prescribe as appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
