<p class="statutory-body">There is established in the Federal Housing Administration a HOPE for Homeowners Program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of the HOPE for Homeowners Program is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to create an FHA program, participation in which is voluntary on the part of homeowners and existing loan holders to insure refinanced loans for distressed borrowers to support long-term, sustainable homeownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to allow homeowners to avoid foreclosure by reducing the principle&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-23_1_target" name="1715z-23_1">1</a></sup> balance outstanding, and interest rate charged, on their mortgages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to help stabilize and provide confidence in mortgage markets by bringing transparency to the value of assets based on mortgage assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to target mortgage assistance under this section to homeowners for their principal residence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to enhance the administrative capacity of the FHA to carry out its expanded role under the HOPE for Homeowners Program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to ensure the HOPE for Homeowners Program remains in effect only for as long as is necessary to provide stability to the housing market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to provide servicers of delinquent mortgages with additional methods and approaches to avoid foreclosure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment and implementation of program requirements</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Penalties</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) False statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Any certification filed pursuant to clause (i) shall contain an acknowledgment that any willful false statement made in such certification is punishable under section 1001,<sup><a href="#1715z-23_2_target" name="1715z-23_2">2</a></sup> of title 18 by fine or imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both.</p>

The Secretary may take such actions, subject to standards established by the Board under subparagraph (B), as may be necessary and appropriate to facilitate coordination and agreement between the holders of the existing senior mortgage and any existing subordinate mortgages, taking into consideration the subordinate lien status of such subordinate mortgages. Such actions may include making payments, which shall be accepted as payment in full of all indebtedness under the eligible mortgage, to any holder of an existing subordinate mortgage, in lieu of any future appreciation payments authorized under subparagraph (B).</p>
