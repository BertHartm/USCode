<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">State member banks may make investments designed primarily to promote the public welfare, including the welfare of low- and moderate-income communities or families (such as by providing housing, services, or jobs), to the extent permissible under State law, and subject to such restrictions and requirements as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may prescribe by regulation or order. A bank shall not make any such investment if the investment would expose the bank to unlimited liability. The Board shall limit a bank's investments in any 1 project and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#338a_1_target" name="338a_1">1</a></sup> bank's aggregate investments under this paragraph. A bank's aggregate investments under this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to the sum of 5 percent of the bank's capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and 5 percent of the bank's unimpaired surplus fund, unless the Board determines by order that the higher amount will pose no significant risk to the affected deposit insurance fund, and the bank is adequately capitalized. In no case shall a bank's aggregate investments under this paragraph exceed an amount equal to the sum of 10 percent of the bank's capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and 10 percent of the bank's unimpaired surplus fund.</p>
