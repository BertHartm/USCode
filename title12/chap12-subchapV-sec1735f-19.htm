<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Secretary is requested to accept assignment of a mortgage insured by the Secretary that covers a multifamily housing project (as such term is defined in section 1701z&ndash;11(b) of this title) and the Secretary determines that partial payment would be less costly to the Federal Government than other reasonable alternatives for maintaining the low-income character of the project, the Secretary may request the mortgagee, in lieu of assignment, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) accept partial payment of the claim under the mortgage insurance contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) recast the mortgage, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As a condition to a partial claim payment under this section, the mortgagor shall agree to repay to the Secretary the amount of such payment and such obligation shall be secured by a second mortgage on the property on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine.</p>
