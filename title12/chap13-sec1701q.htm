<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to enable elderly persons to live with dignity and independence by expanding the supply of supportive housing that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides a range of services that are tailored to the needs of elderly persons occupying such housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly. Such assistance shall be provided as (1) capital advances in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section, and (2) contracts for project rental assistance in accordance with subsection (c)(2) of this section. Such assistance may be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of a structure or a portion of a structure, or the acquisition of a structure, to be used as supportive housing for the elderly in accordance with this section. Assistance may also cover the cost of real property acquisition, site improvement, conversion, demolition, relocation, and other expenses that the Secretary determines are necessary to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forms of assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Capital advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A capital advance provided under this section shall bear no interest and its repayment shall not be required so long as the housing remains available for very low-income elderly persons in accordance with this section. Such advance shall be in an amount calculated in accordance with the development cost limitation established in subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Project rental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Contracts for project rental assistance shall obligate the Secretary to make monthly payments to cover any part of the costs attributed to units occupied (or, as approved by the Secretary, held for occupancy) by very low-income elderly persons that is not met from project income. The annual contract amount for any project shall not exceed the sum of the initial annual project rentals for all units so occupied and any initial utility allowances for such units, as approved by the Secretary. Any contract amounts not used by a project in any year shall remain available to the project until the expiration of the contract. The Secretary may adjust the annual contract amount if the sum of the project income and the amount of assistance payments available under this paragraph are inadequate to provide for reasonable project costs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Initial selection criteria and processing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Selection criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish selection criteria for assistance under this section, which shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the ability of the applicant to develop and operate the proposed housing;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is in geographic proximity to the property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) has demonstrated experience in and capacity for underwriting multifamily housing loans that provide housing and supportive services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) agrees to issue a firm commitment within 12 months of delegation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall retain the authority to process capital advances in cases in which no State or local housing agency has applied to provide delegated processing pursuant to this paragraph or no such agency has entered into an agreement with the Secretary to serve as a delegated processing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An agency to which review and processing is delegated pursuant to subparagraph (A) may assess a reasonable fee which shall be included in the capital advance amounts and may recommend project rental assistance amounts in excess of those initially awarded by the Secretary. The Secretary shall develop a schedule for reasonable fees under this subparagraph to be paid to delegated processing agencies, which shall take into consideration any other fees to be paid to the agency for other funding provided to the project by the agency, including bonds, tax credits, and other gap funding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Under such delegated system, the Secretary shall retain the authority to approve rents and development costs and to execute a capital advance within 60 days of receipt of the commitment from the State or local agency. The Secretary shall provide to such agency and the project sponsor, in writing, the reasons for any reduction in capital advance <!-- PDFPage:464 -->amounts or project rental assistance and such reductions shall be subject to appeal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Provisions of services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall ensure that housing assisted under this section provides a range of services tailored to the needs of the category or categories of elderly persons (including frail elderly persons) occupying such housing. Such services may include (A) meal service adequate to meet nutritional need; (B) housekeeping aid; (C) personal assistance; (D) transportation services; (E) health-related services; (F) providing education and outreach regarding telemarketing fraud, in accordance with the standards issued under section 671(f) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13631(f)); and (G) such other services as the Secretary deems essential for maintaining independent living. The Secretary may permit the provision of services to elderly persons who are not residents if the participation of such persons will not adversely affect the cost-effectiveness or operation of the program or add significantly to the need for assistance under this Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Local coordination of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall ensure that owners have the managerial capacity to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Service coordinators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any cost associated with employing or otherwise retaining a service coordinator in housing assisted under this section shall be considered an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2) of this section. If a project is receiving congregate housing services assistance under section 8011 of title 42, the amount of costs provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section for the project service coordinator may not exceed the additional amount necessary to cover the costs of providing for the coordination of services for residents of the project who are not eligible residents under such section 8011 of title 42. To the extent that amounts are available pursuant to subsection (c)(2) of this section for the costs of carrying out this paragraph within a project, an owner of housing assisted under this section shall provide a service coordinator for the housing to coordinate the provision of services under this subsection within the housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Development cost limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;congregate space&rdquo; shall include space for cafeterias or dining halls, community rooms or buildings, workshops, adult day health facilities, or other outpatient health facilities, or other essential service facilities. Neither this section nor any other provision of law may be construed as prohibiting or preventing the location and operation, in a project assisted under this section, of commercial facilities for the benefit of residents of the project and the community in which the project is located, except that assistance made available under this section may not be used to subsidize any such commercial facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may reduce or waive the owner deposit specified under paragraph (1) for individual applicants if the Secretary finds that such waiver or reduction is necessary to achieve the purposes of this section and the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has the capacity to manage and maintain the housing in accordance with this section.
