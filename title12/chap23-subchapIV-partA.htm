<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;233 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: &ldquo;The revolving fund established by Public Law 87&ndash;343, 75 Stat. 758, as amended, and the revolving fund established by Public Law 87&ndash;494, 76 Stat. 109, as amended, and continued by Public Law 96&ndash;592, shall be merged and shall be available to the Farm Credit Administration for the purchase, on behalf of the United States, of capital stock of the Capital Corporation. The Farm Credit Administration may make such purchases of stock as the Farm Credit Administration determines, in its discretion, are necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">1985&mdash;Pub. L. 99&ndash;205 substituted provisions relating to revolving funds and investments for provisions respecting stock purchased by the Governor for the Farm Credit Administration, retirement, and franchise tax.</p>

<p class="note-body">Amendment by Pub. L. 100&ndash;399 effective as if enacted immediately after enactment of Pub. L. 100&ndash;233, which was approved Jan. 6, 1988, see section 1001(a) of Pub. L. 100&ndash;399, set out as a note under section 2002 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Revolving Funds</h4>
<p class="note-body">The revolving fund established by this section (in effect immediately before January 6, 1988), referred to in text, means the revolving fund created by former provisions of this section, which merged the revolving fund established by Public Law 87&ndash;343, 75 Stat. 758, as amended (described below as &ldquo;first fund&rdquo;), with the revolving fund established by Public Law 87&ndash;494, 76 Stat. 109, as amended (described below as &ldquo;second fund&rdquo;), which was regarded as continued by Pub. L. 96&ndash;592.</p>
<p class="note-body">At the time of enactment of former section 2152 of this title (see second par. of note under former section 2152 of this title) by Pub. L. 92&ndash;181 funds for temporary investment by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration in the farm credit system were available from two revolving funds.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first fund, providing moneys for investment in production credit associations and intermediate credit banks, was covered by former section 1131i of this title. Such fund was itself the result of an earlier merger of two revolving funds, the first having been created by the Farm Credit Act of 1933 and the second having been created by the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation Act of 1934. These two were combined into a single fund pursuant to Pub. L. 87&ndash;343, &sect;2(1), Oct. 3, 1961, 75 Stat. 758. Each of the statutory steps in the establishment of such fund was cast in the form of an amendment to the Farm Credit Act of 1933. Since such Farm Credit Act of 1933 has been repealed by section 5.26 of Pub. L. 92&ndash;181, section 1131i of this title is carried as repealed. Notwithstanding such apparent repeal, statements of Congressional intent indicate an intention to retain the fund using as its statutory base the law (Pub. L. 87&ndash;343) which had effected the consolidation in 1961.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second fund, providing moneys for investment in banks for cooperatives, is covered by section 1141d of this title. Although the basic authority for such fund would be the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, a more updated authority for such fund is the Agricultural Marketing Act Amendment of 1962, Pub. L. 87&ndash;494, June 25, 1962, 76 Stat. 109, under which the fund was reduced to $150,000,000 and the amount in such fund in ex<!-- PDFPage:1238 -->cess of such figure was returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 96&ndash;592, referred to above as continuing the revolving fund established by Pub. L. 87&ndash;494, is the Farm Credit Act Amendment of 1980, Pub. L. 96&ndash;592, Dec. 24, 1980, 94 Stat. 3437. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title of 1980 Amendment note set out under section 2001 of this title and Tables.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Minimum levels of capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Farm Credit Administration shall cause System institutions to achieve and maintain adequate capital by establishing minimum levels of capital for such System institutions and by using such other methods as the Farm Credit <!-- PDFPage:1239 -->Administration deems appropriate. The Farm Credit Administration may establish such minimum level of capital for a System institution as the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, deems to be necessary or appropriate in light of the particular circumstances of the System institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Failure to maintain minimum levels; directives; plans for achieving minimum levels; proposals affecting compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Failure of a System institution to maintain capital at or above its minimum level as established under subsection (a) of this section may be deemed by the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice within the meaning of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to, or in lieu of, any other action authorized by law, including paragraph (1), the Farm Credit Administration may issue a directive to a System institution that fails to maintain capital at or above its required level as established under subsection (a) of this section. Such directive may require the System institution to submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the Farm Credit Administration describing the means and timing by which the System institution shall achieve its required capital level, but may not require merger or consolidation without a majority vote of the voting stockholders or the contributors to the guaranty fund of the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Farm Credit Administration may consider such System institution's progress in adhering to any plan required under paragraph (2) whenever such System institution, or an affiliate thereof, seeks the requisite approval of the Farm Credit Administration for any proposal that would divert earnings, diminish capital, or otherwise impede such System institution's progress in achieving its minimum capital level. The Farm Credit Administration may deny such approval where it determines that such proposal would adversely affect the ability of the System institution to comply with such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enhancement of capital adequacy of banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each bank shall have on hand at the time of issuance of any note, bond, debenture, or other similar obligation and at all times thereafter maintain, free from any lien or other pledge, notes and other obligations representing loans made under this chapter or real or personal property acquired in connection with loans made under this chapter, obligations of the United States or any agency thereof direct or fully guaranteed, other bank assets (including marketable securities) approved by the Farm Credit Administration, or cash, in an aggregate value equal to the total amount of notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations outstanding for which the bank is primarily liable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;permanent capital&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) current year retained earnings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) allocated and unallocated earnings (which, in the case of earnings allocated in any form by a System bank to any association or other recipient and retained by the bank, shall be considered, in whole or in part, permanent capital of the bank or of any such association or other recipient as provided under an agreement between the bank and each such association or other recipient);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) all surplus (less allowances for losses);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) stock issued by a System institution, except&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) stock that is protected under section 2162 of this title or is otherwise not at risk; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adoption of bylaws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to approval by shareholders under subsection (c)(2) of this section, each bank and association shall adopt bylaws, developed by its board of directors, that provide for the capitalization of the institution in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements of bylaws</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the bylaws adopted under subsection (b) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall provide for such classes, par value, and amounts of the stock of the institution, the manner in which such stock shall be issued, transferred, and retired, and the payment of dividends and patronage refunds, as determined appropriate by the Board of Directors, subject to this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may provide for the charging of loan origination fees as determined appropriate by the Board of Directors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall enable the institution to meet the capital adequacy standards established under the regulations issued under section 2154(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall provide for the issuance of voting stock, which may only be held by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) borrowers who are farmers, ranchers, or producers or harvesters of aquatic products, and cooperative associations eligible to borrow from System institutions under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a Central Bank for Cooperatives, other banks for cooperatives; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the case of banks other than banks for cooperatives, System associations;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) as a condition of borrowing from or through the institution, any borrower who is entitled to hold voting stock or participation certificates shall, at the time a loan is made, acquire voting stock or participation certificates in an amount not less than $1,000 or 2 percent of the amount of the loan, whichever is less; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) shall permit stock to be transferable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The bylaws adopted by the board of directors of a System institution under subsection (b) of <!-- PDFPage:1241 -->this section shall take effect only on approval of a majority of the stockholders of such institution present and voting, or voting by written proxy, at a duly authorized stockholders&rsquo; meeting.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction of capital</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the board of directors of a System institution may not reduce the permanent capital of the institution through the payment of patronage refunds or dividends, or the retirement of stock if, after or due to such action, the permanent capital of the institution would thereafter fail to meet the minimum capital adequacy standards established under section 2154(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the payment of noncash patronage refunds by any institution exempt from Federal income tax if the entire refund paid qualifies as permanent capital. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), any System institution subject to Federal income tax may pay patronage refunds partially in cash as long as the cash portion of the refund is the minimum amount required to qualify the refund as a deductible patronage distribution for Federal income tax purposes and the remaining portion of the refund paid qualifies as permanent capital.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Farm Credit Administration may issue a directive that requires compliance with subsection (d) of this section, to the board of directors of any System institution that fails to comply therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Loans designated for sale or sold into secondary market</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the bylaws adopted by a bank or association under subsection (b) of this section may provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a loan made on or after February 10, 1996, that is designated, at the time the loan is made, for sale into a secondary market, that no voting stock or participation certificate purchase requirement shall apply to the borrower for the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a loan made before February 10, 1996, that is sold into a secondary market, that all outstanding voting stock or participation certificates held by the borrower with respect to the loan shall, subject to subsection (d)(1) of this section, be retired.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the case of a loan sold to a secondary market under subchapter VIII of this chapter, paragraph (1) shall apply regardless of whether the bank or association retains a subordinated participation interest in a loan or pool of loans or contributes to a cash reserve.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B) and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a loan designated for sale under paragraph (1)(A) is not sold into a secondary market during the 180-day period that begins on the date of the designation, the voting stock or participation certificate purchase requirement that would otherwise apply to the loan in the absence of a bylaw provision described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be effective.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Retirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The bylaws adopted by a bank or association under subsection (b) of this section may provide that if a loan described in subparagraph (A) is sold into a secondary market after the end of the 180-day period described in the subparagraph, all outstanding voting stock or participation certificates held by the borrower with respect to the loan shall, subject to subsection (d)(1) of this section, be retired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not be construed to affect the provisions of this chapter that confer on System institutions a lien on borrower stock or other equities and the privilege to retire or cancel such stock or other equities for application against the indebtedness on a defaulted or restructured loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Controlling authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent that any provision of this section is inconsistent with any other provision of this chapter (other than section 2162 of this title), the provision of this section shall control.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Joint and several liability of banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each bank of the System shall be fully liable on notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations issued by it individually, and shall be liable for the interest payments on long-term notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations issued by other banks operating under the same subchapter of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Each bank shall also be primarily liable for the portion of any issue of consolidated or System-wide obligations made on its behalf and be jointly and severally liable for the payment of any additional sums as called upon by the Farm Credit Administration in order to make payments of interest or principal which any bank primarily liable therefor shall be unable to make.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such calls first shall be made on all nondefaulting banks in proportion to each such bank's proportionate share of the aggregate available collateral held by all such banks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;available collateral&rdquo; means the amount (determined at the close of the last calendar quarter ending before such call) by which a bank's collateral as described in section 2154 of this title exceeds the collateral required to support the bank's outstanding notes, bonds, debentures, and other similar obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Farm Credit Administration makes any such call and the available collateral of all such banks does not fully satisfy the liability necessitating such calls, such calls shall be made on all nondefaulting banks in proportion to each such bank's remaining assets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Any System bank that, pursuant to a call by the Farm Credit Administration, makes a payment of principal or interest to the holder of any consolidated or System-wide obligation issued on behalf of another System bank shall be subrogated to all rights of the holder against such other bank to the extent of such payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) On making such a call with respect to obligations issued on behalf of a System bank, the Farm Credit Administration shall appoint a receiver for the bank, which shall expeditiously liquidate or otherwise wind up the affairs of the bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Resolutions as to liability; execution of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each bank participating in an issue shall by appropriate resolution undertake such responsibility as provided in subsection (a) of this section, and in the case of consolidated or System-wide obligations shall authorize the execution of such long-term notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations on its behalf. When a consolidated or System-wide issue is approved, the notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations shall be executed and the banks shall be liable thereon as provided herein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) United States liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States shall not be liable or assume any liability directly or indirectly thereon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance Fund called on before invoking joint and several liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning 5 years after January 6, 1988, the Farm Credit Administration shall not call on any System institution to satisfy the liability of the institution on any joint, consolidated, or System-wide obligation participated in by the institution or with respect to which the institution is primarily, or jointly and severally, liable, before the Farm Credit Insurance Fund is exhausted, even if the Fund is only able to make a partial payment because of insufficient amounts in the Fund.</p>
