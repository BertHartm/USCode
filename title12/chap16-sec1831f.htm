<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any insured depository institution for which the Corporation has been appointed as conservator, subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to the acceptance of deposits (described in such subsection) by such institution if the Corporation determines that the acceptance of such deposits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not an unsafe or unsound practice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is necessary to enable the institution to meet the demands of its depositors or pay its obligations in the ordinary course of business; and</p>
