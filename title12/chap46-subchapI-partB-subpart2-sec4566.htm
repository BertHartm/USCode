<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish guidelines to measure the extent of compliance with the housing goals, which may assign full credit, partial credit, or no credit toward achievement of the housing goals to different categories of mortgage purchase activities of the enterprises, based on such criteria as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extent of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining compliance with the housing goals established under this subpart, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall consider any single mortgage purchased by an enterprise as contributing to the achievement of each housing goal for which such mortgage purchase qualifies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may take into consideration the number of housing units financed by any mortgage on housing purchased by an enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice and determination of failure to meet goals</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that an enterprise has failed, or that there is a substantial probability that an enterprise will fail, to meet any housing goal established under section 4562, 4563, or 4564 of this title, the Secretary shall provide written notice to the enterprise of such a determination, the reasons for such determination, the requirement to submit a housing plan under subsection (c) of this section, and the information on which the Secretary based the determination or imposed such requirement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Response period</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">During the 30-day period beginning on the date that an enterprise is provided notice under paragraph (1), the enterprise may submit to the Secretary any written information that the enterprise considers appropriate for consideration by the Secretary in determining whether such failure has occurred or whether the achievement of such goal was or is feasible.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extended period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may extend the period under subparagraph (A) for good cause for not more than 30 additional days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may shorten the period under subparagraph (A) for good cause.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Failure to respond</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consideration of information and determination</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After the expiration of the response period under paragraph (2) or upon receipt of information provided during such period by the enterprise, whichever occurs earlier, the Secretary shall determine (i) whether the enterprise has failed, or there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail, to meet the housing goal, and (ii) whether (taking into consideration market and economic conditions and the financial condition of the enterprise) the achievement of the housing goal was or is feasible.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Considerations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) each determination that an enterprise has failed, or that there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail, to meet a housing goal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) each determination that the achievement of a housing goal was or is feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the reasons for each such determination.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each housing plan shall be a feasible plan describing the specific actions the enterprise will take&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to achieve the goal for the next calendar year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the Secretary determines that there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail to meet a goal in the current year, to make such improvements as are reasonable in the remainder of such year.</p>
