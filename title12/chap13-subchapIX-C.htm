<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1 of Pub. L. 94&ndash;13 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds that (1) under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Public Law 90&ndash;448, approved August 1, 1968), as amended [this subchapter], the powers of the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to enter into new reinsurance contracts with respect to the Federal riot reinsurance program and into new direct insurance contracts with respect to the Federal crime insurance program will terminate on April 30, 1975, except to the extent necessary (a) to continue policies of direct insurance and reinsurance, until April 30, 1978, (b) to handle claims and those arising under the policies still in force on the termination date of the program, and (c) to complete the liquidation and termination of the reinsurance and direct insurance programs; (2) continuation of the Federal riot reinsurance program is essential both to the operation of the system of State FAIR plans, which provide access for many people to basic property insurance not otherwise available in urban areas, and to the continued existence of such FAIR plans inasmuch as many State laws condition the very existence of such FAIR plans upon the continued existence of the Federal riot reinsurance program; (3) continuation of the Federal crime insurance program, which provides access for many homeowners, tenants, and small businessmen to burglary, robbery, and similar coverages, in States where an insurance coverage availability problem exists, is likewise essential; (4) withdrawal at this time of the Federal support which these programs give to the insurance buying public and the insurers would be particularly ill timed and inadvisable in view of the (a) threatening major shortage of voluntary insurance facilities to which the consumer can turn to fulfill his insurance purchase needs and (b) the potential for insurer insolvencies inherent in times of economic stress; and (5) the impending tightening of the availability of insurance coverage in the insurance market will only intensify due to the present economic conditions confronting insurers, which affect the capital adequacies of insurers due to severe declines in the values of insurers&rsquo; securities portfolios, thus impacting on their ability to increase their underwritings in a growing insurance market.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to extend the duration of the national insurance development program so as to maintain the Federal riot reinsurance program which reinsures the general property insurance business against the catastrophic peril of riot and, thus, makes this insurance available, together with its review and compliance function which assures that the intent of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Public Law 90&ndash;448, approved August 1, 1968) as amended [this subchapter] is carried out, as well as the Federal crime insurance program which provides basic crime insurance coverages in the States where it is needed, both of which programs aid the insurance purchasing consumer when, from time to time and especially in times such as these, insurers engage in conscious policies of market constriction which lead to serious inner-city insurance availability problems of the kind the national insurance development program has been created to ameliorate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1102 of Pub. L. 90&ndash;448, as amended by Pub. L. 91&ndash;609, title VI, &sect;601, Dec. 31, 1970, 84 Stat. 1788, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds that (1) the vitality of many American cities is being threatened by the deterioration of their inner city areas; responsible owners of well-maintained residential, business, and other properties in many of these areas are unable to obtain adequate property insurance coverage against fire, crime, and other perils; the lack of such insurance coverage accelerates the deterioration of these areas by discouraging private investment and restricting the availability of credit to repair and improve property therein; and this deterioration poses a serious threat to the national economy; (2) recent riots and other civil commotion in many American cities have brought about abnormally high losses to the private property insurance industry for which adequate reinsurance cannot be ob<!-- PDFPage:817 -->tained at reasonable cost, and the risk of such losses will make most lines of property insurance even more difficult to obtain; (3) the capacity of the private property insurance industry to provide adequate insurance is threatened, and the continuity of such property insurance protection is essential to the extension of credit in these areas; and (4) the national interest demands urgent action by the Congress to assure that essential lines of property insurance, including lines providing protection against riot and civil commotion damage will be available to property owners at reasonable cost.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The purposes of this title [this subchapter] are, therefore, to (1) encourage and assist the various State insurance authorities and the property insurance industry to develop and carry out statewide programs which will make necessary property insurance coverage against the fire, crime, and other perils more readily available for residential, business, and other properties meeting reasonable underwriting standards; (2) provide a Federal program of reinsurance against abnormally high property insurance losses resulting from riots and other civil commotion, placing appropriate financial responsibility upon the States to share in such losses; and (3) provide direct insurance through the facilities of the Federal Government in the case of properties for which statewide programs and the Federal reinsurance program either do not make crime insurance available or offer such insurance to property owners only at prohibitive cost.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cooperation by insurers with State insurance authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each insurer reinsured under this subchapter shall cooperate with the State insurance authority in each State in which it is to acquire such reinsurance in establishing and carrying out statewide plans to assure fair access to insurance requirements (FAIR plans).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval and administration of plans; provisions of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such plans must be approved by, and administered under the supervision of, the State insur<!-- PDFPage:819 -->ance authority, or be authorized or required by State law, and shall be designed to make essential property insurance more readily available in, but not necessarily limited to, urban areas. Such plans may vary in detail from State to State because of local conditions, but all plans shall contain provisions that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no risk shall be written at surcharged rates or be denied insurance coverage for essential property insurance unless there has first been an inspection of the risk, without cost to the owner, by an inspection facility and a determination by the insurer, based on information in the inspection report and other sources, that the risk does not meet reasonable underwriting standards at the applicable premium rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inspections under the plan may be requested by the property owner or his representative, the insurer, or the insurance agent, broker or other producer, and such requests need not be made in writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the absence of a building owner or his representative during an inspection shall not preclude a tenant seeking insurance from obtaining an inspection under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) following the inspection, a copy of the inspection report shall be promptly sent by the inspection facility to the insurer or insurers, or to an all-industry placement facility referred to under section 1749bbb&ndash;4 of this title, as may be designated by the person requesting the inspection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) after the inspection report is received by an insurer, it shall promptly determine if the risk meets reasonable underwriting standards at the applicable premium rate, and shall promptly return to the inspection facility the inspection report and provide an action report setting forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the amount of coverage it agrees to write; and if the insurer agrees to write the coverage with a surcharge (if such a surcharge is authorized by the State insurance authority), the improvements necessary before it will provide coverage at an unsurcharged premium rate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount of coverage it agrees to write if certain improvements specified in the action report are made; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the specific reasons it declines to write coverage;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) if the insurer declines the risk, or agrees to write the coverage sought on condition that the property will be improved, it shall also promptly send a copy of both the inspection and action reports to the property owner and the State insurance authority, and at the time the insurer sends such reports to the property owner, it shall also explain his right, under applicable State laws, to appeal the decision of the insurer to the State insurance authority, setting forth the procedures to be followed for such appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) all policies written pursuant to the plan shall be promptly written after inspection or reinspection and shall be separately coded so that appropriate records may be compiled for purposes of performing loss prevention and other studies of the operation of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the inspection facility shall submit to the State insurance authority and to the Director periodic reports setting forth information, by individual insurers, including the number of risks inspected under the plan, the number of risks accepted, the number of risks conditionally accepted and reinspections made, the number of risks declined, and such other information as the State insurance authority may request;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) notice will be given to any policyholder a reasonable time prior to the cancellation or nonrenewal of any risk eligible under the plan (except in case of nonpayment of premium or evidence of incendiarism), to allow ample time for an application for new coverage to be made and a new policy to be written under the plan, and the insurer shall, in writing, explain to the policyholder the procedures for obtaining an inspection under the plan in the notice of cancellation or nonrenewal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) a continuing public education program will be undertaken by the participating insurers, agents, and brokers to assure that the plan receives adequate public attention.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Membership of board of directors, board, etc., for each plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At least one-third of the voting members of every board of directors, board of governors, advisory committee, and other governing or advisory board or committee for each plan described in subsection (b) of this section shall be individuals who are not employed by, or otherwise affiliated with, insurers, insurance agents, brokers, producers, or other entities of the insurance industry.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reimbursement for total proved and approved claims for covered losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reinsurance offered under this subchapter shall reimburse an insurer or pool for its total proved and approved claims for covered losses resulting from riots of civil disorders during the term of the reinsurance contract, agreement, treaty, or other arrangement, over and above the amount of the insurers&rsquo; or pool's retention of such losses as provided in such reinsurance contract, agreement, treaty, or other arrangement entered into under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after thirty days following notification to the insurer that the Director finds (after consultation with the State insurance authority) that there has not been adopted by the State, or the property insurance industry in that State, a suitable program or programs, in addition to plans under part A, to make essential property insurance available without regard to environmental hazards, and that such action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter; except that this paragraph shall not become effective until two years after August 1, 1968, or at such earlier date as the Director, after consultation with the State insurance authority, may determine;</p>

Such insurance shall be provided upon such terms and conditions, and subject to such deductibles and other restrictions and limitations, as the Director deems appropriate, but no such insurance shall be made available to a property which the Director determines to be uninsurable or to a property with respect to which reasonable protective measures to prevent loss, consistent with standards established by the Director, have not been adopted.</p>
