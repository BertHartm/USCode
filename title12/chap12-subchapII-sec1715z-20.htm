<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to authorize the Secretary to carry out a demonstration program of mortgage insurance designed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to meet the special needs of elderly homeowners by reducing the effect of the economic hardship caused by the increasing costs of meeting health, housing, and subsistence needs at a time of reduced income, through the insurance of home equity conversion mortgages to permit the conversion of a portion of accumulated home equity into liquid assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage and increase the involvement of mortgagees and participants in the mortgage markets in the making and servicing of home equity conversion mortgages for elderly homeowners; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to require the evaluation of data to determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the extent of the need and demand among elderly homeowners for insured and uninsured home equity conversion mortgages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the types of home equity conversion mortgages that best serve the needs and interests of elderly homeowners, the Federal Government, and lenders; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the appropriate scope and nature of participation by the Secretary in connection with home equity conversion mortgages for elderly homeowners.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:686 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The terms &ldquo;elderly homeowner&rdquo; and &ldquo;homeowner&rdquo; mean any homeowner who is, or whose spouse is, at least 62 years of age or such higher age as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The terms &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo;, &ldquo;mortgagee&rdquo;, &ldquo;mortgagor&rdquo;, and &ldquo;State&rdquo; have the meanings given such terms in section 1707 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;home equity conversion mortgage&rdquo; means a first mortgage which provides for future payments to the homeowner based on accumulated equity and which a housing creditor (as defined in section 3802(2) of this title) is authorized to make (A) under any law of the United States (other than section 3803 of this title) or applicable agency regulations thereunder; (B) in accordance with section 3803 of this title, notwithstanding any State constitution, law, or regulation; or (C) under any State constitution, law, or regulation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost for a short-term mortgage; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Protection of homeowner and lender</h4>
