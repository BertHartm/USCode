<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mortgagee Review Board</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is established within the Federal Housing Administration the Mortgagee Review Board (&ldquo;Board&rdquo;). The Board is empowered to initiate the issuance of a letter of reprimand, the probation, suspension or withdrawal of any mortgagee found to be engaging in activities in violation of Federal Housing Administration requirements or the nondiscrimination requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act [15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.], the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.], or Executive Order 11063.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Letter of reprimand</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may issue a letter of reprimand only once to a mortgagee without taking action under subparagraphs&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1708_2_target" name="1708_2">2</a></sup> (B), (C), or (D) of this section. A letter of reprimand shall explain the violation and describe actions the mortgagee should take to correct the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Probation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may place a mortgagee on probation for a specified period of time not to exceed 6 months for the purpose of evaluating the mortgagee's compliance with Federal Housing Administration requirements, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act [15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.], the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.], Executive Order 11063, or orders of the Board. During the probation period, the Board may impose reasonable additional requirements on a mortgagee including supervision of the mortgagee's activities by the Federal Housing Administration, periodic reporting to the Federal Housing Commissioner, or submission to Federal Housing Administration audits of internal financial statements, audits by an independent certified public accountant or other audits.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may issue an order temporarily suspending a mortgagee's approval for doing business with the Federal Housing Administration if (i) there exists adequate evidence of a violation or violations and (ii) continuation of the mortgagee's approval, pending or at the completion of any audit, investigation, or other review, or such administrative or other legal proceedings as may ensue, would not be in the public interest or in the best interests of the Department. Notwithstanding paragraph (4)(A), a suspension shall be effective upon issuance by the Board if the Board determines that there exists adequate evidence that immediate action is required to protect the financial interests of the Department or the public. A suspension shall last for not less than 6 months, and for not longer than 1 year. The Board may extend the suspension for an additional 6 months if it determines the extension is in the public interest. If the Board and the mortgagee agree, these time limits may be extended. During the period of suspension, the Federal Housing Administration shall not commit to insure any mortgage originated by the suspended mortgagee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Withdrawal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may issue an order withdrawing a mortgagee if the Board has made a determination of a serious violation or repeated violations by the mortgagee.

Where the Board has determined that the violation is egregious or willful, the withdrawal shall be permanent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Settlements</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice and hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Board shall issue a written notice to the mortgagee at least 30 days prior to taking any action against the mortgagee under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (3). The notice shall state the specific violations which have been alleged, and shall direct the mortgagee to reply in writing to the Board within 30 days. If the mortgagee fails to reply during such period, the Board may make a determination without considering any comments of the mortgagee.</p>

Such order shall include a notice of charges in respect thereof and shall become effective upon service to the mortgagee. Such order shall remain effective and enforceable for a period not to exceed 30 days pending the completion of proceedings of the Board with respect to such violation, unless such order is set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. The Board shall provide the mortgagee an opportunity for a hearing on the record, as soon as practicable but not later than 20 days after the temporary cease-and-desist order has been served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Within 10 days after the mortgagee has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the mortgagee may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the mortgagee is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting of suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the mortgagee, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary cease-and-desist order issued pursuant to this paragraph, the Secretary may apply to the United States district court, or the United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which the home office of the mortgagee is located, for an injunction to enforce such order, and, if the court shall determine that there has been such violation or threatened violation or failure to obey, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction.</p>

All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default: <em>Provided</em>, That debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation.

Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages insured under section 1709 or section 1713 of this title prior to February 3, 1938 shall be subject only to such Federal, State, and local taxes as the mortgages in exchange for which they are issued would be subject to in the hands of the holder of the debentures and shall be a liability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, but such debentures shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; but any mortgagee entitled to receive any such debentures may elect to receive in lieu thereof a cash adjustment and de<!-- PDFPage:564 -->bentures issued as hereinafter provided and bearing the current rate of interest.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;mortgagee&rdquo; means the original lender under a mortgage, and its successors and assigns, and includes the holders of credit instruments issued under a trust mortgage or deed of trust pursuant to which such holders act by and through a trustee therein named.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes the several States, and Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insurance of additional mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to mortgages insured under section 1709 of this title, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages as defined in this section (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover property held by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Federal or State instrumentalities, municipal corporate instrumentalities of one or more States, or limited dividend or redevelopment or housing corporations restricted by Federal or State laws or regulations of State banking or insurance departments as to rents, <!-- PDFPage:575 -->charges, capital structure, rate of return, or methods of operation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any other mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, require any such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation so as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment. Any such regulations or restrictions shall continue for such period or periods as the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may require, including until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder, or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire, for not to exceed $100, such stock or interest in the mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulations or restrictions. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The insurance of mortgages under this section is intended to facilitate particularly the production of rental accommodations, at reasonable rents, of design and size suitable for family living. The Secretary is, therefore, authorized in the administration of this section to take action, by regulation or otherwise, which will direct the benefits of mortgage insurance hereunder primarily to those projects which make adequate provision for families with children, and in which every effort has been made to achieve moderate rental charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary may not insure any mortgage under this section (except a mortgage with respect to a manufactured home park designed exclusively for occupancy by elderly persons) unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for the property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certification to be filed with the Secretary. Violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for insurance; mortgage limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage on any property or project shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Repealed. Pub. L. 93&ndash;383, title III, &sect;304(a)(1), Aug. 22, 1974, 88 Stat. 677.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project (when the proposed improvements are completed): <em>Provided</em>, That this limitation shall not apply to mortgages on housing in Alaska or in Guam, but such a mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the value of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the land, the proposed physical improvements, utilities within the boundaries of the property or project, architect's fees, taxes, and interest accruing during construction, and other miscellaneous charges incident to construction and approved by the Secretary): <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing contained in this section shall preclude the insurance of mortgages covering existing construction located in slum or blighted areas, as defined in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section, and the Secretary may require such repair or rehabilitation work to be completed as is, in his discretion, necessary to remove conditions detrimental to safety, health, or morals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Not to exceed, for such part of the property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use (excluding exterior land improvements as defined by the Secretary), $30,420 per family unit without a bedroom, $33,696 per family unit with one bedroom, $40,248 per family unit with two bedrooms, $49,608 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $56,160 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, or not to exceed $9,000 per space; except that as to projects to consist of elevator type structures the Secretary may in his discretion, increase the dollar amount limitations per family unit to not to exceed $35,100 per family unit without a bedroom, $39,312 per family unit with one bedroom, $48,204 per family unit with two bedrooms, $60,372 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $68,262 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, as the case may be, to compensate for the higher costs incident to the construction of elevator-type structures of sound standards of construction and design; and except that the Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the foregoing dollar amount limitations contained in this paragraph by not to exceed 110 percent in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require and by not to exceed 140 percent where the Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis, but in no case may any such increase exceed 90 percent where the Secretary determines that a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association in implementing its special assistance functions under section 1720&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> of this title (as such section existed immediately before November 30, 1983) is involved. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards <!-- PDFPage:576 -->and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments (unless otherwise approved by the Secretary) within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release. No mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this section or section 1715a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> of this title unless the Secretary finds that the property or project, with respect to which the mortgage is executed, is economically sound. Such property or project may include five or more family units and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Premium, appraisal, and inspection charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall collect a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this section which shall be payable annually in advance by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under any subchapter and section of this chapter, except debentures of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, or of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund at par plus accrued interest. In addition to the premium charge herein provided for the Secretary is authorized to charge and collect such amounts as he may deem reasonable for the appraisal of a property or project offered for insurance and for the inspection of such property or project during construction: <em>Provided</em>, That such charges for appraisal and inspection shall not aggregate more than 1 per centum of the original principal face amount of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjusted premium charge on payment of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this section is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until such maturity date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Repealed. Pub. L. 89&ndash;117, title XI, &sect;1108(e)(3), Aug. 10, 1965, 79 Stat. 504</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment of insurance after default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this section shall be considered a default under such mortgage and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loans not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transactions. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (h) of this section, and debentures having a par value equal to the original principal face amount of the mortgage plus such amount as the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default, less the sum of (i) that part of the amount of the principal obligation that has been repaid by the mortgagor, (ii) an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the unpaid amount of such principal obligation, and (iii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagee in the event of a default under the mortgage may, at its option and in accordance with regulations of, and in a period to be determined by, the Secretary, proceed to foreclose on and obtain possession of or otherwise acquire such property from the mortgagor after default, and receive the benefits of the insurance as herein provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims that may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in this subsection, except that in such event the 1 per centum deduction, set out in (ii) hereof, shall not apply. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon receipt, after September 2, 1964, of an application for insurance benefits on a mortgage insured under this chapter, the Secretary may terminate the mortgagee's obligation to pay premium charges on the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Certificate of claim; division of excess proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued under this section shall be for an amount which the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:577 -->determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, on the date of the assignment, transfer and delivery to the Secretary provided for in subsection (g) of this section, the mortgagor had extinguished the mortgage indebtedness by payment in full of all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. If the net amount realized from the mortgage, and all claims in connection therewith, so assigned, transferred, and delivered, and from the property covered by such mortgage and all claims in connection with such property, after deducting all expenses incurred by the Secretary in handling, dealing with, acquiring title to, and disposing of such mortgage and property and in collecting such claims, exceeds the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be negotiable, and, if in book entry form, transferable, in the manner described by the Secretary in regulations, and shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in subsection (g) of this section, except that debentures issued pursuant to the provisions of section 1715k(f), section 1715<em>l</em>(g), and section 1715x of this title may be dated as of the date the mortgage is assigned (or the property is conveyed) to the Secretary and shall bear interest from such date. They shall bear interest at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715<em>o</em> of this title payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for mortgages insured after February 3, 1938, shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amount so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Debentures; form and amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be in such form and amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be subject to such terms and conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may be in book entry or certificated registered form, or such other form as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may prescribe in regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Acquisition of property by conveyance or foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized either to (1) acquire possession of and title to any property, covered by a mortgage insured under this section and assigned to him, by voluntary conveyance in extinguishment of the mortgage indebtedness, or (2) institute proceedings for foreclosure on the property covered by any such insured mortgage and prosecute such proceedings to conclusion. The Secretary at any sale under foreclosure may, in his discretion, for the protection of the General Insurance Fund, bid any sum up to but not in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness secured by the mortgage, plus taxes, insurance, foreclosure costs, fees, and other expenses, and may become the purchaser of the property at such sale. In determining the amount to be bid, the Secretary shall act consistently with the goal established in section 1701z&ndash;11(a)(1) of this title. The Secretary is authorized to pay from the General Insurance Fund such sums as may be necessary to defray such taxes, insurance, costs, fees, and other expenses in connection with the acquisition or foreclosure of property under this section. Pending such acquisition by voluntary conveyance or by foreclosure, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to any mortgage assigned to him under the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, to exercise all the rights of a mortgagee under such mortgage, including the right to sell such mortgage, and to take such action and advance such sums as may be necessary to preserve or protect the lien of such mortgage.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:578 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real and other property by the United States, the Secretary shall also have power, for the protection of the interests of the General Insurance Fund, to pay out of the General Insurance Fund all expenses or charges in connection with, and to deal with, complete, reconstruct, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts for the management of, or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit or lease in his discretion, any property acquired by him under this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection by way of compromise or otherwise all claims assigned and transferred to him in connection with the assignment, transfer, and delivery provided for in this section, and at any time, upon default, to foreclose on any property secured by any mortgage assigned and transferred to or held by him: <em>Provided</em>, That section 5 of title 41 shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Repealed. Pub. L. 89&ndash;117, title XI, &sect;1108(e)(3), Aug. 10, 1965, 79 Stat. 504</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In the event that a mortgage insured under this section becomes in default through failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of the mortgage and such mortgage continues in default for a period of thirty days, but the mortgagee does not foreclose on or otherwise acquire the property, or does not assign and transfer such mortgage and the credit instrument secured thereby to the Secretary, in accordance with subsection (g) of this section, and the Secretary is given written notice thereof, or in the event that the mortgagor pays the obligation under the mortgage in full prior to the maturity thereof, and the mortgagee pays any adjusted premium charge required under the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, and the Secretary is given written notice by the mortgagee of the payment of such obligation, the obligation to pay the annual premium charge for insurance shall cease, and all rights of the mortgagee and the mortgagor under this section shall terminate as of the date of such notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Reissue of prior insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, with the consent of the mortgagee and the mortgagor of a mortgage insured under this section prior to February 3, 1938, shall be empowered to reissue such mortgage insurance in accordance with the provisions of this section as amended by the National Housing Act Amendments of 1938, and any such insurance not so reissued shall not be affected by the enactment of such Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Repealed. Pub. L. 89&ndash;117, title XI, &sect;1108(e)(3), Aug. 10, 1965, 79 Stat. 504</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development finds that, because of higher costs prevailing in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands, it is not feasible to construct dwellings or manufactured home courts or parks on property located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, or livability, within the limitations as to maximum or maxima mortgage amounts provided in this chapter, the Secretary may, by regulations or otherwise, prescribe, with respect to dollar amount, a higher maximum or maxima for the principal obligation of mortgages insured under this chapter covering property located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands in such amounts as he shall find necessary to compensate for such higher costs but not to exceed, in any event, the maximum or maxima otherwise applicable (including increased mortgage amounts in geographical areas where cost levels so require) by more than one-half thereof. No mortgage with respect to a project or property in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands shall be accepted for insurance under this chapter unless the Secretary finds that the project or property is an acceptable risk giving consideration to the acute housing shortage in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands: <em>Provided</em>, That any such mortgage may be insured or accepted for insurance without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter that the Secretary find the project or property to be economically sound or an acceptable risk. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter or any other law, the Alaska Housing Authority or the Government of Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Hawaii or any agency or instrumentality thereof shall be eligible as mortgagor or mortgagee, as the case may be, for any of the purposes of <!-- PDFPage:586 -->mortgage insurance under the provisions of this chapter. Upon application by the mortgagee (1) where the mortgagor is regulated or restricted pursuant to the last sentence of this section or (2) where the Alaska Housing Authority or the Government of Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Hawaii or any agency or instrumentality thereof is the mortgagor or mortgagee, for the insurance of a mortgage under any provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure the mortgage (including advances thereon where otherwise authorized), and to make commitments for the insuring of any such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, under such provision (and this section) without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor shall have paid a prescribed amount on account of such property. Without limiting the authority of the Secretary under any other provision of law, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to any mortgagor in such case (except where the Alaska Housing Authority is the mortgagor or mortgagee), to require the mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods or operation to such an extent and in such manner as the Secretary determines advisable to provide reasonable rentals and sales prices and a reasonable return on the investment.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Failure to sell to a nonprofit organization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that a mortgagor of the character described in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section obtains an insured mortgage loan pursuant to this section and fails to sell the property or project covered by such mortgage to a nonprofit housing corporation or nonprofit housing trust of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to refuse, for such period of time as he shall deem appropriate under the circumstances, to insure under this section any additional investor-sponsor type mortgage loans made to such mortgagor or to any other investor-sponsor mortgagor where, in the determination of the Secretary, any of its stockholders were identified with such mortgagor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Mortgages executed by consumer cooperatives covering existing structures</h4>

In the case of properties other than new construction, the limitations in this section upon the amount of the mortgage shall be based upon the appraised value of the property for continued use as a cooperative rather than upon the Secretary's estimate of the replacement cost. As to any project on which construction was commenced after September 23, 1959, the mortgage on such project shall be eligible for insurance under this section only in those cases where the construction was subject to inspection by the Secretary and where there was compliance with the provisions of section 1715c of this title. As to any project on which construction was commenced prior to September 23, 1959, such inspection, and compliance with the provisions of section 1715c of this title, shall not be a prerequisite.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Insurance of supplementary cooperative loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to any property covered by a mortgage insured under this section (or any cooperative housing project covered by a mortgage insured under section 1713 of this title as in effect prior to April 20, 1950), the Secretary is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to make commitments to insure and to insure supplementary cooperative loans (including advances during construction or improvement) made by financial institutions approved by the Secretary. The Secretary is further authorized to make commitments to insure and to insure supplementary cooperative loans (including advances during construction or improvement) with respect to any property purchased from the Federal Government by a nonprofit corporation or trust of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, if the property is covered by an uninsured mortgage representing a part of the purchase price. As used in this subsection &ldquo;supplementary cooperative loan&rdquo; means a loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing a loan or advance of credit made for the purpose of financing any of the following:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a supplementary cooperative loan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be limited to an amount which, when added to the outstanding mortgage indebtedness on the property, creates a total outstanding indebtedness which does not exceed the original principal obligation of the mortgage; except that, in the case of improvements or additional community facilities, the outstanding indebtedness may be increased by an amount equal to 97 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the value of such improvements or facilities, and the new outstanding indebtedness may exceed the original principal obligation of the mortgage if such new outstanding indebtedness does not exceed the limitations imposed by subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed the remaining term of the mortgage; except that, in the case of repairs or improvements to a property covered by an uninsured mortgage dated more than twenty years prior to the date of the commitment to insure, of such magnitude that the Secretary deems them to be a major rehabilitation or modernization of such property, the loan may have a maturity date up to ten years in excess of the remaining term of the uninsured mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be secured in such manner as the Secretary may require;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) contain such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) represent the obligation of a borrower of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby created a Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Management Fund&rdquo;). The Management Fund shall be used by the Secretary as a revolving fund for carrying out the provisions of this section with respect to mortgages or loans insured, on or after August 10, 1965, under subsections (a)(1), (a)(3) (if the project is acquired by a cooperative corporation), (i), and (j) of this section. The Management Fund shall also be used as a revolving fund for mortgages, loans, and commitments transferred to it pursuant to subsection (m) of this section. The Secretary is directed to transfer to the Management Fund from the General Insurance Fund an amount equal to the total of the premium payments theretofore made with respect to the insurance of mortgages and loans transferred to the Management Fund pursuant to subsection (m) of this section minus the total of any administrative expenses theretofore incurred in connection with such mortgages and loans, plus such other amounts as the Secretary determines to be necessary and appropriate.

The aggregate net income thereafter received or any net loss thereafter sustained by the Management Fund, in any semiannual period, shall be credited or charged to the General <!-- PDFPage:590 -->Surplus Account or the Participating Reserve Account or both in such manner and amounts as the Secretary may determine to be in accord with sound actuarial and accounting practice. Upon termination of the insurance obligation of the Management Fund by payment of any mortgage or loan insured under this section, and at such time or times prior to such termination as the Secretary may determine, the Secretary is authorized to distribute to the mortgagor or borrower a share of the Participating Reserve Account in such manner and amount as the Secretary shall determine to be equitable and in accordance with sound actuarial and accounting practice: <em>Provided</em>, That in no event shall the amount of the distributable share exceed the aggregate scheduled annual premiums of the mortgagor or borrower to the year of payment of the share less the total amount of any share or shares previously distributed by the Secretary to the mortgagor or borrower: <em>And provided further</em>, That in no event may a distributable share be distributed until any funds transferred from the General Insurance Fund to the Management Fund pursuant to subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section have been repaid in full to the General Insurance Fund. No mortgagor, mortgagee, borrower, or lender shall have any vested right in a credit balance in any such account or be subject to any liability arising out of the mutuality of the Management Fund. The determination of the Secretary as to the amount to be paid by him to any mortgagor or borrower shall be final and conclusive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Transfer of insurance to Management Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to transfer to the Management Fund commitments for insurance issued under subsections (a)(1), (i), and (j) of this section prior to August 10, 1965, and to transfer to the Management Fund the insurance of any mortgage or loan insured prior to August 10, 1965, under subsection (a)(1), (a)(3) (if the project is acquired by a cooperative corporation), (i), or (j) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the insurance of any mortgage or loan shall not be transferred under the provisions of this subsection if on August 10, 1965, the mortgage or loan is in default and the mortgagee or lender has notified the Secretary in writing of its intention to file an insurance claim. Any insurance or commitment not so transferred shall continue to be an obligation of the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Payment of premium charges in debentures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the limitations contained in other provisions of this chapter, premium charges for mortgages or loans the insurance of which is the obligation of either the Management Fund or the General Insurance Fund may be payable in debentures issued in connection with mortgages or loans transferred to the Management Fund or in connection with mortgages or loans insured pursuant to commitments transferred to the Management Fund, as provided in subsection (m) of this section. Premium charges on the insurance of mortgages or loans transferred to the Management Fund or insured pursuant to commitments transferred to the Management Fund may be payable in debentures which are the obligation of either the Management Fund or the General Insurance Fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(11) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no home improvement loan made in whole or in part for the purpose specified in clause (A)(ii) of the second sentence of paragraph (1) shall be insured under this subsection if such loan (or the portion thereof which is attributable to such purpose), when added to the aggregate principal balance of any outstanding loans insured under this subsection or section 1709(k) of this title which were made to the same borrower for the purpose so specified (or the portion of such aggregate balance which is attributable to such purpose), would exceed $10,000 or such additional amount as the Secretary has by regulation prescribed in any geographical area where he finds cost levels so require pursuant to the authority vested in him by the proviso in paragraph (2)(i) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) as to mortgages meeting the requirements of this section which are insured or initially endorsed for insurance on or after June 30, 1961, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such paragraphs in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire a mortgage loan that is in default and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary and made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage, and after the acquisition of any such mortgage by the Secretary the mortgagee shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations with respect to the loan or the security for the loan. The appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the issuance of debentures shall apply with respect to debentures issued under this paragraph, and the appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a mortgagee shall apply with respect to the Secretary when he has acquired an insured mortgage under this paragraph, in accordance with and subject to regulations (modifying such provisions to the extent necessary to render their application for such purposes appropriate and effective) which shall be prescribed by the Secretary, except that as applied to mortgages so acquired (A) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (B) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section.

The term &ldquo;going Federal rate&rdquo; as used herein means the annual rate of interest which the Secretary of the Treasury shall specify as applicable to the six-month period (consisting of January through June or July through December) which includes the issuance date of such debentures, which applicable rate for each such six-month period shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by estimating the average yield to maturity, on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations or prices during the month of May or the month of November, as the case may be, next preceding such six-month period, on all outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a maturity date of eight to twelve years from the first day of such month of May or November (or, if no such obligations are outstanding, the obligation next shorter than eight years and the obligation next longer than twelve years, respectively, shall be used), and by adjusting such estimated average annual yield to the nearest one-eight of 1 per centum. The Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to mortgages assigned to him under this paragraph as contained in sections 1713(k) and 1713(<em>l</em>) of this title as to mortgages insured by the Secretary and assigned to him under section 1713 of this title.</p>

Upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery of the credit instrument and the mortgage to the Association, the mortgage insurance contract shall terminate and the mortgagee shall receive insurance benefits as provided in subparagraph (A). The Association is authorized to accept such loan documents in its own name and to hold, service, and sell such loans as agent for the Secretary. The mortgagor's obligation to pay a service charge in lieu of a mortgage insurance premium shall continue as long as the mortgage is held by <!-- PDFPage:609 -->the Association or by the Secretary.

The Secretary shall arrange the auction and sale at a price, to be paid to the mortgagee, of par plus accrued interest to the date of sale. The sale price shall also include the right to a subsidy payment described in clause (iii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) A mortgagee who elects to assign a mortgage shall provide the Secretary and persons bidding at the auction a description of the characteristics of the original credit instrument and mortgage securing the original credit instrument, which shall include the principal mortgage balance, original stated interest rate, service fees, real estate and tenant characteristics, the level and duration of applicable Federal subsidies, and any other information determined by the Secretary to be appropriate.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) The Secretary shall, upon receipt of the information in subclause (II), promptly advertise for an auction and publish such mortgage descriptions in advance of the auction. The Secretary may conduct the auction at any time during the 6-month period beginning upon receipt of the information in subclause (II) but under no circumstances may the Secretary conduct an auction before 2 months after receiving the mortgagee's written notice of intent to assign its mortgage to the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Preservation of Low-Income Housing</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, consisting of title II of Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, Feb. 5, 1988, 101 Stat. 1877, amended the National Housing Act, the United States Housing Act of 1937, and the Housing Act of 1949, and enacted provisions formerly set out as a note under this section. The provisions set out as a note under this section consisted of subtitles A and B [&sect;&sect;201&ndash;203, 221&ndash;230, and 231&ndash;235] of title II of Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, as amended by Pub. L. 100&ndash;628, title X, &sect;&sect;1021&ndash;1027, Nov. 7, 1988, 102 Stat. 3270, 3271; Pub.

As amended, subtitles A and B of title II are classified generally to subchapter I (&sect;4101 et seq.) of chapter 42 of this title. Prior to the general revision by Pub. L. 101&ndash;625, subtitles A and B of title II read as follows:</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;subtitle a&mdash;general provisions</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title [amending sections 1715z&ndash;6 and 1715z&ndash;15 of this title and sections 1437f, 1472, 1485, and 1487 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] may be cited as the &lsquo;Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insured or assisted under sections <!-- PDFPage:621 -->221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3), 1715z&ndash;1] could be lost as a result of the termination of low income affordability restrictions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in the next decade, more than 465,000 low income housing units produced with assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistance contracts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) some 150,000 units of rural low income housing financed under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1485] are threatened with loss as a result of the prepayment of mortgages by owners;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave national crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the loss of this affordable housing, to encourage the production of which the public has provided substantial benefits over past years, would irreparably damage hard-won progress toward such important and long-established national objectives as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) providing a more adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing that is affordable to low income Americans;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) increasing the supply of housing affordable to low income Americans that is accessible to employment opportunities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) expanding housing opportunities for all Americans, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the provision of an adequate supply of low income housing has depended and will continue to depend upon a strong, long-term partnership between the public and private sectors that accommodates a fair return on investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) recent reductions in Federal housing assistance and tax benefits related to low income housing have increased the incentives for private industry to withdraw from the production and management of low income housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) efforts to retain this housing must take account of specific financial and market conditions that differ markedly from project to project;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) a major review of alternative responses to this threatened loss of affordable housing is now being undertaken by numerous private sector task forces as well as State and local organizations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) until the Congress can act on recommendations that will emerge from this review, interim measures are needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housing and irrevocable displacement of current tenants.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to preserve and retain to the maximum extent practicable as housing affordable to low income families or persons those privately owned dwelling units that were produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to continue the partnership between all levels of government and the private sector in the production and operation of housing that is affordable to low income Americans.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; housing certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to aid in the provision of housing accommodations for servicemen in the armed forces of the United States and their families, servicemen in the United States Coast Guard and their families, and servicemen in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and their families by supplementing the insurance of mortgages under section 1709 of this title with a system of mortgage insurance specially designed to assist the financing required for the construction or purchase of dwellings by those persons. As used in this section, a &ldquo;serviceman&rdquo; means a person to whom the Secretary of Defense (or any officer or employee designated by him), the Secretary of Transportation (or any officer or employee designated by him), or the Secretary of Commerce (or any officer or employee designated by him), as the case may be, has issued a certificate hereunder indicating that such person requires housing, is serving on active duty in the armed forces of the United States, in the United States Coast Guard, or in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has served on active duty for more than two years, but a certificate shall not be issued hereunder to any person ordered to active duty for training purposes only. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Commerce, respectively, are authorized to prescribe rules and regulations governing the issuance of such certificates and may withhold issuance of more than one such certificate to a serviceman whenever in his discretion issuance is not justified due to circumstances resulting from military assignment, or, in the case of the United States Coast Guard or the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility of mortgage for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Manner of acceptance; payment of premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe the manner in which a mortgage may be accepted for insurance under this section.

As used herein, &ldquo;the period of ownership by a serviceman&rdquo; means the period, for which premiums are fixed, prior to the date that the Secretary of Defense (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), the Secretary of Transportation (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), or the Secretary of Commerce (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), as the case may be, furnishes the Secretary with a certification that such ownership (as defined by the Secretary), has terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Entitlement of mortgagee to benefits</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of insurance on mortgages covering single-family dwellings or one-family units in condominium projects if mortgage is assumed by serviceman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to transfer to this section the insurance on any mortgage covering a single-family dwelling or a one-family unit in a condominium project insured under this chapter, if the mortgage indebtedness thereof has been assumed by a serviceman who at the time of assumption is the owner of the property and either occupies the property as a principal residence or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of his military assignment, or, in the case of the United States Coast Guard or the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Extension of period of ownership where serviceman dies while on active duty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a serviceman dies while on active duty in the armed forces of the United States or in the United States Coast Guard or in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving a surviving widow as owner of the property, the period of ownership by the serviceman (within the meaning of subsection (c) of this section) shall extend for two years beyond the date of the serviceman's death or until the date the widow disposes of the property, whichever date occurs first. The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary of Commerce, as the case may be, shall notify such widow promptly following the serviceman's death of the additional costs to be borne by the mortgagor following termination of the two-year period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this subchapter and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in section 1715<em>l</em> of this title, the Secretary may in his discretion insure under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) of this title any mortgage executed by a mortgagor of the character described therein where such mortgage is given to refinance a mortgage covering an existing property or project (other than a one- to four-family structure) located in an urban renewal area, if the Secretary finds that such insurance will facilitate the occupancy of dwelling units in the property or project by families of low or moderate income or families displaced from an urban renewal area or displaced as a result of governmental action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insurance of certain assigned mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also have authority to insure under this chapter any mortgage assigned to the Secretary in connection with payment under a contract of mortgage insurance or executed in connection with the sale by the Secretary, including a sale through another entity acting under authority of the fourth sentence of section 1710(g) of this title, of any property acquired under any section or subchapter of this chapter without regard to any limitations or requirements contained in this chapter upon the eligibility of the mortgage, upon the payment of insurance premiums, or upon the terms and conditions of insurance settlement and the benefits of the insurance to be included in such settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance of loans made to cover operating losses of certain projects having existing mortgages insured by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure loans made to cover the operating losses of certain projects that have existing project mortgages insured by the Secretary. Insurance under this subsection shall be in the Secretary's discretion and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, and shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;operating loss&rdquo; means the amount by which the sum of the taxes, interest on the mortgage debt, mortgage insurance premiums, hazard insurance premiums, and the expense of maintenance and operation of the project covered by the mortgage, exceeds the income of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988; and (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the operating loss shall have occurred during the first 24 months after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding the operating loss.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988; (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling; and (iii) shall not cover a subsidized project, as defined by the Secretary;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:629 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the unreimbursed cash contributions made on or after March 18, 1987, by the project owner for the use of the project, during any period of consecutive months (not exceeding 24 months) in the first 10 years after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary, except that in no event may the amount of the loan exceed the operating loss during such period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the loan shall be made within 10 years after the end of the period of consecutive months referred to in the preceding subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the project shall meet all applicable underwriting and other requirements of the Secretary at the time the loan is to be made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any loan insured pursuant to this subsection shall (A) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee; (B) be secured in such manner as the Secretary shall require; (C) be limited to a term not exceeding the unexpired term of the original mortgage; and (D) be insured under the same section as the original mortgage. The Secretary may provide insurance pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), or pursuant to both such paragraphs, in connection with an existing project mortgage, except that the Secretary may not provide insurance pursuant to both such paragraphs in connection with the same period of months referred to in paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B). The Secretary is authorized to collect a premium charge for insurance of loans pursuant to this subsection in any amount computed at the same premium rate as is applicable to the original mortgage. This premium shall be payable in cash or in debentures of the insurance fund under which the loan is insured at par plus accrued interest. In the event of a failure of the borrower to make any payment due under such loan or under the original mortgage, both the loan and original mortgage shall be considered in default, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to insurance benefits, computed in the same manner as for the original mortgage, except that in determining the interest rate under section 1715<em>o</em> of this title for the debentures representing the portion of the claim applicable to the loan, the date of the commitment to insure the loan and the insurance date of the loan shall be taken into consideration rather than the commitment or insurance date for the original mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A loan involving a project covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715e of this title that is the obligation of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund shall be the obligation of such fund, and loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715z&ndash;1 of this title or under any section of this subchapter pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In determining the amount of an operating loss loan to be insured pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall not reduce such amount solely to reflect any amounts placed in escrow (at the time the existing project mortgage was insured) for initial operating deficits. If an operating loss loan was insured by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection before October 28, 1992, and was reduced solely to reflect the amount placed in escrow for initial operating deficits, the Secretary shall insure, to the extent of the availability of insurance authority provided in appropriation Acts, an increase in the existing loan or a separate loan, in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the maximum amount permitted under this subsection and the applicable underwriting requirements established by the Secretary and in effect at the time the loan is to be made, or (B) the amount of the escrow for initial operating deficits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property in older, declining urban areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter except section 1715c of this title, and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX&ndash;B of this chapter, other than the limitation in section 1709(g) of this title, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX&ndash;B of this chapter a mortgage executed in connection with the repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property located in an older, declining urban area in which the conditions are such that one or more of the eligibility requirements applicable to the section or subchapter under which insurance is sought could not be met if the Secretary finds that (1) the area is reasonably viable, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing or group practice facilities for families of low and moderate income in such area, and (2) the property is an acceptable risk in view of such consideration. The insurance of a mortgage pursuant to this subsection shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with purchase or refinancing of existing multifamily housing project; refinancing of existing debt of existing hospital, or purchase or refinancing of rental rehabilitated property; terms and conditions, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized, in his discretion, to insure under any section of this subchapter a mortgage executed in connection with the purchase of refinancing of an existing multifamily housing project or the refinancing of existing debt of an existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of the purchase or refinancing under this subsection of a multifamily housing project located in an older, declining urban area, the Secretary shall make available an amount not to exceed $30,000,000 of available purchase authority pursuant to section 1720 of this title to reduce interest rates on low- and moderate-income rental housing in projects having 100 units or less which otherwise could not support refinancing and moderate rehabilitation without <!-- PDFPage:630 -->causing excessive rent burdens on current tenants due to rent increases. The Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as he deems necessary to assure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the refinancing is used to lower the monthly debt service only to the extent necessary to assure the continued economic viability of the project, taking into account any rent reductions to be implemented by the mortgagor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) during the mortgage term no rental increases shall be made except those which are necessary to offset actual and reasonable operating expense increases or other necessary expense increases and maintain reasonable profit levels approved by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For all insurance authorized by this subsection and provided pursuant to a commitment entered into after October 8, 1980, the Secretary may not accept an offer to prepay or request refinancing of a mortgage secured by rental housing unless the Secretary takes appropriate action that will obligate the borrower (and successors in interest thereof) to utilize the property as a rental property for a period of five years from the date on which the insurance was provided (twenty years in the case of any such mortgage purchased under section 1720&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715n_1_target" name="1715n_1">1</a></sup> of this title) unless the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the conversion of the property to a cooperative, or condominium form of ownership is sponsored by a bona fide tenants&rsquo; organization representing a majority of the households in the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) continuance of the property as rental housing is clearly unnecessary to assure adequate rental housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income people in the community; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) continuance of the property as rental housing would have an undesirable and deleterious effect on the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of refinancing of an existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof) the Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the refinancing is employed to lower the monthly debt service costs (taking into account any fees or charges connected with such refinancing) of such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the proceeds of any refinancing will be employed only to retire the existing indebtedness and pay the necessary cost of refinancing on such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof) is economically viable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the applicable requirements for certificates, studies, and statements of section 1715w of this title (for the existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, intermediate care facility, board and care home, or any combination thereof, proposed to be refinanced) or of section 1715z&ndash;7 of this title (for the existing hospital proposed to be refinanced) have been met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of any purchase or refinancing under this subsection involving property to be rehabilitated or developed under section 1437<em>o</em>&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715n_1_target" name="1715n_1">1</a></sup> of title 42, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include rehabilitation or development costs of not to exceed $20,000 per unit, except that the Secretary may increase such amount by not to exceed 25 per centum for specific properties where cost levels so require;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) permit subordinated liens securing up to the full amount of mortgage financing provided by State or local governments or agencies thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) pay such benefits in cash unless the mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Insurance of mortgages covering multifamily housing projects including units not self-contained</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the Secretary may, in his discretion, insure a mortgage covering a multifamily housing project including units which are not self-contained.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no mortgage covering new or rehabilitated multifamily housing or a property or project described in subchapter IX&ndash;B of this chapter shall be insured under this chapter unless the mortgagor has agreed (a) to certify, upon completion of the physical improvements on the mortgaged property or project and prior to final endorsement of the mortgage, either (i) that the approved percentage of actual cost (as those terms are herein defined) equaled or exceeded the proceeds of the mortgage loan or (ii) the amount by which the proceeds of the mortgage loan exceeded such approved percentage of actual cost, as the case may be, and (b) to pay forthwith to the mortgagee, for application to the reduction of the principal obligation of such mortgage, the amount, if any, certified to be in excess of such approved percentage of actual cost. Upon the Secretary's approval of the mortgagor's certification as required hereunder, such certification shall be final and incontestable, except for fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the mortgagor. As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The term &ldquo;new or rehabilitated multifamily housing&rdquo; means a project or property approved for mortgage insurance prior to the construction or the repair and rehabilitation involved and covered by a mortgage insured or to be insured (i) under section 1713 of this title, (ii) under section 1715e of this title with respect to any property or project of a corporation or trust of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 1715e of this title or with respect to any property or project of a mortgagor of the character described in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) thereof, (iii) under section 1715k of this title if the mortgage meets the requirements of paragraph (3)(B) of subsection (d) thereof, (iv) under section 1715<em>l</em> of this title if the mortgage meets the requirements of paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) of subsection (d) thereof, (v) under section 1715v of this title, (vi) under section 1715x of this title if the mortgage meets the requirements of subsection (b), (vii) under section 1748h&ndash;2 of this title if the mortgage meets the requirements of subsection (f), (viii) under section 1715y(d) of this title, or (ix) under section 1715z&ndash;1 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The term &ldquo;approved percentage&rdquo; means the percentage figure which, under applicable provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to apply to his estimate of value, cost, or replacement costs, as the case may be, of the property or project in determining the maximum insurable mortgage amount; except that if the mortgage is to assist the financing of repair or rehabilitation and no part of the proceeds will be used to finance the purchase of the land or structure involved, the approved percentage shall be 100 per centum; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The term &ldquo;actual cost&rdquo; has the following meaning: (i) in case the mortgage is to assist the financing of new construction, the term means the actual cost to the mortgagor of such construction, including amounts paid for labor, materials, construction contracts, off-site public utilities, streets, organizational and legal expenses, such allocations of general overhead items as are acceptable to the Secretary, and other items of expense approved by the Secretary, plus (1) a reasonable allowance for builder's profit if the mortgagor is also the builder as defined by the Secretary, and (2) an amount equal to the Secretary's estimate of the fair market value of any land (prior to the construction of the improvements built as a part of the project) in the property or project owned by the mortgagor in fee (or, in case the land in the property or project is held by the mortgagor under a leasehold or other interest less than a fee, such amount as the mortgagor paid for the acquisition of such leasehold or other interest but, in no event, in excess of the fair market value of such leasehold or other interest exclusive of the proposed improvements), but excluding the amount of any kickbacks, rebates, or trade discounts received in connection with the construction of the improvements, or (ii) in case the mortgage is to assist the financing of repair or rehabilitation the terms means the actual cost to the mortgagor of such repair or rehabilitation, including the amounts paid for labor, materials, construction contracts, off-site public utilities, streets, organization and legal expenses, such allocations of general overhead items as are acceptable to the Secretary, and other items of expense approved by the Secretary, plus (1) a reasonable allowance for builder's profit if the mortgagor is also the builder as <!-- PDFPage:636 -->defined by the Secretary, and (2) an additional amount equal to (A) in case the land and improvements are to be acquired by the mortgagor and the purchase price thereof is to be financed with part of the proceeds of the mortgage, the purchase price of such land and improvements prior to such repair or rehabilitation, or (B) in case the land and improvements are owned by the mortgagor subject to an outstanding indebtedness to be refinanced with part of the proceeds of the mortgage, the amount of such outstanding indebtedness secured by such land and improvements, but excluding (for the purposes of this clause (ii)) the amount of any kickbacks, rebates, or trade discounts received in connection with the construction of the improvements: <em>Provided</em>, That such additional amount under (A) of this clause (ii) shall in no event exceed the Secretary's estimate of the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to such repair or rehabilitation, and such additional amount under (B) of this clause (ii) shall in no event exceed the approved percentage of the Secretary's estimate of the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to such repair or rehabilitation. In the case of a mortgage insured under section 1715k, 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(4), 1715v, 1715x, or 1715z&ndash;1 of this title where the mortgagor is also the builder as defined by the Secretary, there shall be included in the actual cost, in lieu of the allowance for builder's profit under clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence, an allowance for builder's and sponsor's profit and risk of 10 per centum (unless the Secretary, after finding that such allowance is unreasonable, shall by regulation prescribe a lesser percentage) of all other items entering into the term &ldquo;actual cost&rdquo; except land or amounts paid for a leasehold and amounts included under either (A) or (B) of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to assist in lowering housing costs and improving housing standards, quality, livability, or durability or neighborhood design through the utilization of advanced housing technology, or experimental property standards, the Secretary is authorized to insure and to make commitments to insure, under this section, mortgages (including home improvement loans, and including advances on mortgages during construction) secured by properties including dwellings involving the utilization and testing of advanced technology in housing design, materials, or construction, or experimental property standards for neighborhood design if the Secretary determines that (A) the property is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the need for testing advanced housing technology or experimental property standards, (B) the utilization and testing of the advanced technology or experimental property standards involved will provide data or experience which the Secretary deems to be significant in reducing housing costs or improving housing standards, quality, livability, or durability, or improving neighborhood design, and (C) the mortgages are eligible for insurance under the provisions of this section and under any further terms and conditions which may be prescribed by the Secretary to establish the acceptability of the mortgages for insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is further authorized to insure and to make commitments to insure, under this section, mortgages (including advances on mortgages during construction) secured by properties in projects to be carried out in accordance with plans approved by the Secretary under section 1701z of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance; conditions; limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall meet the requirements of one of the other sections or subchapters of this chapter; except that, in lieu of determining the appraised value or the replacement cost of the property in cases involving new construction or the estimated cost of repair and rehabilitation of improvement in cases involving existing properties, the Secretary shall estimate the cost of replacing the property using comparable conventional design, materials, and construction, and any limitation upon the maximum mortgage amount available to a nonoccupant owner shall not, in the discretion of the Secretary, be applicable to mortgages insured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contracts, agreements, and financial undertakings with mortgagor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into such contracts, agreements, and financial undertakings with the mortgagor and others as he deems necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this section, and may expend available funds for such purposes, including the correction (when he determines it necessary to protect the occupants), <!-- PDFPage:647 -->at any time subsequent to insurance of a mortgage, of defects or failures in the dwellings which the Secretary finds are caused by or related to the advanced housing technology utilized in their design or construction or experimental property standards. Any authority which the Secretary may exercise in connection with a mortgage, or property covered by a mortgage, insured under any other section of this subchapter (including payments to reduce rentals for, or to facilitate homeownership by, lower income families) may be exercised in connection with a mortgage, or property covered by a mortgage, meeting the requirements of such other section (except as specified in subsection (b) of this section), which is insured under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as if the mortgage insured under this section was insured under such other section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investigations and analysis of data; publication and distribution of reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make such investigations and analyses of data, and publish and distribute such reports, as he determines to be necessary or desirable to assure the most beneficial use of the data and information to be acquired as a result of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Entitlement to insurance benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee or lender under a mortgage insured under subsection (b) of this section shall be entitled to insurance benefits determined in the same manner as such benefits would be determined if such mortgage or loan were insured under the section or subchapter of this chapter for which it otherwise would have been eligible except for the experimental feature of the property involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Defaults; payment in cash or debentures; acquisition of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, in the case of default on any mortgage insured under this section, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such subsections in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire the mortgage loan and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage. After the acquisition of the mortgage by the Secretary the mortgagee shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations with respect to the mortgage. The appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the issuance of debentures shall apply with respect to debentures issued under this subsection, and the appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a mortgagee shall apply with respect to the Secretary when he has acquired an insured mortgage under this subsection, in accordance with and subject to regulations (modifying such provisions to the extent necessary to render their application for such purposes appropriate and effective) which shall be prescribed by the Secretary, except that as applied to mortgages insured under this section (1) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (2) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section. If the insurance payment is made in cash, there shall be added to such payment an amount equivalent to the interest which the debentures would have earned, computed to a date to be established pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1715y. Mortgage insurance for condominiums</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to provide an additional means of increasing the supply of privately owned dwelling units where, under the laws of the State in which the property is located, real property title and ownership are established with respect to a one-family unit which is part of a multifamily project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The terms &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo;, &ldquo;mortgagee&rdquo;, &ldquo;mortgagor&rdquo;, &ldquo;maturity date&rdquo;, and &ldquo;State&rdquo; shall have the meanings respectively set forth in section 1707 of this title, except that the term &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; for the purposes of subsection (c) this section may include a first mortgage given to secure the unpaid purchase price of a fee interest in, or a long-term leasehold interest in, a one-family unit in a multifamily project, including a project in which the dwelling units are attached, semi-attached, or detached, and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project where the mortgage is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for insurance under this section. The term &ldquo;common areas and facilities&rdquo; as used in this section shall be deemed to include the land and such commercial, community, and other facilities as are approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization; eligibility for insurance; conditions; limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized, in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe (including the minimum number of family units in the project which shall be offered for sale and provisions for the protection of the consumer and the public interest), to insure any mortgage covering a one-family unit in a multifamily project and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project, if (1) the mortgage meets the requirements of this subsection and of section 1709(b) of this title, except as that section is modified by this subsection, and (2) at least 80 percent of the units in the project covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter are occupied by the mortgagors or comortgagors. Any project proposed to be constructed or rehabilitated after June 30, 1961, with the assistance of mortgage insurance under this chapter, where the sale of family units is to be assisted with mortgage insurance under this subsection, shall be subject to such requirements as the Secretary may prescribe. To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this subsection, a mortgage shall (A) involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed the maximum principal obligation of a mortgage which may be insured in the area pursuant to section 1709(b)(2) of this title or pursuant to section 1709(h) of this title under the conditions described in section 1709(h) of this title, and (B) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary, but not to exceed, in any event, thirty-five years from the date of the beginning of amortization of the mortgage. The mortgage shall contain such provisions as the Secretary determines to be necessary for the maintenance of common areas and facilities and the multifamily project. The mortgagor shall have exclusive right to the use of the one-family unit covered by the mortgage and, together with the owners of other units in the multifamily project, shall have the right to the use of the common areas and facilities serving the project and the obligation of maintaining all such common areas and facilities. The Secretary may require that the rights and obligations of the mortgagor and the owners of other dwelling units in the project shall be subject to such controls as he determines to be necessary and feasible to promote and protect individual owners, the multifamily project, and its occupants. For the purposes of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe to permit one-family units and interests in common areas and facilities in multifamily projects covered by mortgages insured under any section of this chapter (other than section 1715e(a)(1) and (2) of this title) to be released from the liens of those mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Blanket mortgages of multifamily projects; plan of family unit ownership; regulations; stock purchase and redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to individual mortgages insured under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary is authorized, in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure blanket mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover multifamily projects to be constructed or rehabilitated in cases where the mortgage is held by a mortgagor, approved by the Secretary, which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has certified to the Secretary, as a condition of obtaining the insurance of a blanket mortgage under this subsection, that upon <!-- PDFPage:649 -->completion of the multifamily project covered by such mortgage it intends to commit the ownership of the multifamily project to a plan of family unit ownership under which each family unit would be eligible for individual mortgage insurance under subsection (c) of this section and will faithfully and diligently make and carry out all reasonable efforts to establish such plan of family unit ownership and to sell such family units to purchasers approved by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may, in the Secretary's discretion, be regulated or restricted as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulation or restriction of such mortgagor.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1715z. Homeownership or membership in cooperative association for lower income families</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic assistance payments to mortgagees; assistance to manufactured home buyers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of assisting lower income families in acquiring homeownership or in ac<!-- PDFPage:653 -->quiring membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of such homeowners and cooperative members. The assistance shall be accomplished through payments to mortgagees holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section or which mortgages are assisted under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance or tax abatement. In making such assistance available, the Secretary shall give preference to low-income families who, without such assistance, would be likely to be involuntarily displaced (including those who would be likely to be displaced from rental units which are to be converted into a condominium project or a cooperative project). Such assistance may include the acquisition of a condominium or a membership in a cooperative association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments under this section on behalf of families whose incomes do not exceed the maximum income limits prescribed pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section for the purpose of assisting such families in acquiring ownership of a manufactured home consisting of two or more modules and a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, except that periodic assistance payments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this section after January 1, 1976. Assistance payments under this section pursuant to this paragraph shall be accomplished through payments on behalf of an owner of lower-income of a manufactured home as described in the preceding sentence to the financial institution which makes the loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing the loan or advance of credit to finance the purchase of the manufactured home and the lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, but only if insurance under section 1703 of this title covering such loan, advance of credit, or obligation has been granted to such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, assistance payments provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, real and personal property taxes, insurance, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title due under the loan or advance of credit remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the manufactured homeowner's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear interest at a rate derived by subtracting from the interest rate applicable to such loan or advance of credit the interest rate differential between the maximum interest rate plus mortgage insurance premium applicable to mortgages insured under subsection (i) of this section at the time such loan or advance of credit is made and the interest rate which such mortgages are presumed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to bear for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications and eligibility requirements for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for assistance payments, the homeowner or the cooperative member shall be of lower income and satisfy eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the homeowner shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which meets the requirements of and is insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That a mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section but insured under section 1715z&ndash;2 of this title may qualify for assistance payments if such mortgage was executed by a mortgagor who is determined not to be an acceptable credit risk for mortgage insurance purposes (but otherwise eligible) under subsection (j)(4) of this section or under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(2) or 1715y(c) of this title and accepted as a reasonably satisfactory credit risk under section 1715z&ndash;2 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the cooperative association of which the family is a member shall operate (A) a housing project the construction or substantial rehabilitation of which has been financed with a mortgage insured under section 1715e or section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) of this title and which has been completed within two years prior to the filing of the application for assistance payments and the dwelling unit has had no previous occupant other than the family: <em>Provided</em>, That if any cooperative member who has received assistance payments transfers his membership and occupancy rights to another person who satisfies the eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary and undertakes the obligation to pay occupancy charges, the new cooperative member may qualify for assistance payments upon the filing of an application with respect to the dwelling unit involved to be occupied by him: <em>Provided further</em>, That assistance payments may be made with respect to a dwelling unit in an existing cooperative project which meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe, if the family qualifies as a displaced family as defined in section 1715<em>l</em>(f) of this title, or a family which includes five or more minor persons, or a family occupying low-rent public housing: <em>Provided further</em>, That the amount of the mortgage attributable to the dwelling unit shall involve a principal obligation not in excess of $40,000 ($47,500 in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that costs levels so require), except that with respect to any family with five or more persons the foregoing limits shall be $47,500 and $55,000, respectively; or (B) a housing project which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance <!-- PDFPage:654 -->through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which prior to completion of construction or rehabilitation is approved for receiving the benefits of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on payments on behalf of mortgagor; occupancy of property; maximum amount of payment; recapture of amounts; determination, applicability, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, the assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a mortgagor shall be made during such time as the mortgagor shall continue to occupy the property which secures the mortgage: <em>Provided</em>, That assistance payments may be made on behalf of a homeowner who assumes a mortgage insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) of this section with respect to which assistance payments have been made on behalf of the previous owner, if the homeowner is approved by the Secretary as eligible for receiving such assistance: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such assistance payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary. Assistance payments pursuant to any new contract, other than a contract in connection with a refinancing under subsection (r) of this section, entered into after September 30, 1983, that utilizes authority approved in appropriation Acts for any fiscal year beginning after such date may not be made for more than a 10-year period. The payment shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance premium due under the mortgage remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the mortgagor's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest which the mortgagor would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum (4 per centum per annum in the case of a mortgage described in subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon disposition by the homeowner of any property assisted pursuant to this section or where the homeowner rents such a property (or the owner's unit in the case of a two- to four-family property) for a period longer than one year, the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of assistance actually received under this section, other than any amount provided under subsection (e) of this section, or (ii) an amount equal to at least 50 per centum of the net appreciation of the property, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;net appreciation of the property&rdquo; means any increase in the value of the property over the original purchase price, less the reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made to the property, and any increase in the mortgage amount as of the time of sale over the original mortgage balance due to the mortgage being insured pursuant to section 1715z&ndash;10 of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance shall constitute a debt secured by the property to the extent that the Secretary may provide for such recapture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to any property with respect to which there is assumption in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection or to any property which is subject to a mortgage, loan, or other advance of credit insured pursuant to subsection (q) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) There hereby is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund, which, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, may be used by the Secretary for purposes of carrying out subparagraph (B). There shall be deposited into such fund (i) any amount recaptured under paragraph (2); (ii) any authority to make assistance payments under subsection (a) of this section that is committed for use in a contract but is unused because the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved is refinanced (except to the extent provided in subsection (r) of this section for mortgages insured under such subsection) or because such assistance payments are terminated or suspended for other reasons before the original termination date of such contract; and (iii) any amount received under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of any homeowner whose assistance payments are terminated by reason of the 10-year limitation referred to in paragraph (1), and who is determined by the Secretary to be unable to assume the full payments due under the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved, the Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of amounts in the fund established in subparagraph (A), contract to make, and make, continued assistance payments on behalf of such homeowner. Such continued assistance payments shall be made in an amount determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (1) or subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section and for such period as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any amounts in such fund determined by the Secretary to be in excess of the amounts currently required to carry out the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall be invested by the Secretary in obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by, the United States or any agency of the United States. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any amounts of budget authority or contract authority recaptured from assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages that are being refinanced that are not required for assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages insured under this subsection, shall be rescinded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on payments on behalf of family holding membership in cooperative association; occupancy; maximum amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a family holding membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project shall be made only during such time as the family is an occupant of such project and shall be in amounts computed on the basis of the formula set forth in subsection (c) of <!-- PDFPage:655 -->this section applying the cooperative member's proportionate share of the obligations under the project mortgage to the items specified in the formula.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement for expenses in handling the mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (a)(2)(B), (c), (d), (j)(7), or (r) of this section, as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Adoption of procedures for recertifications of mortgagor's or cooperative member's income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertifications of the mortgagor's (or cooperative member's) income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of such assistance payments within the limits of the formula described in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations to assure that sales price or other consideration paid is not increased above appraised value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not increased above the appraised value on which the maximum mortgage which the Secretary will insure is computed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of assistance payment contracts; maximum income limits of families; limitation on payments with respect to existing dwellings or dwelling units in existing projects and for approved substantial rehabilitation of dwellings or dwelling units in projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including such sums as may be necessary to make the assistance payments under contracts entered into under this section. The aggregate amount of outstanding contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $75,000,000 per annum prior to July 1, 1969, which maximum dollar amount shall be increased by $125,000,000 on July 1, 1969, by $150,000,000 on July 1, 1970, by $200,000,000 on July 1, 1971, by such sums as may be approved in appropriation Acts after June 30, 1974, and prior to July 1, 1976, and by such sums as may be approved in an appropriation Act on or after October 1, 1983 (from the additional authority to enter into contracts made available on such date under the first sentence of section 1437c(c)(1) of title 42). The aggregate amount that may be obligated over the duration of the contracts entered into with the authority provided on or after October 1, 1983 (other than obligations in connection with mortgages insured under subsection (r) of this section), may not exceed such sums of new budget authority as may be appropriated after November 30, 1983.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of owner of rental housing project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of reducing rentals for lower income families, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed for occupancy by lower income families, which shall be accomplished through payments to morgagees&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_1_target" name="1715z-1_1">1</a></sup> holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restrictions on payments; payments with respect to projects financed under State or local programs; mortgage insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest reduction payments with respect to a project shall only be made during such time as the project is operated as a rental housing project and is subject to a mortgage which meets the requirements of, and is insured under, subsection (j) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such interest reduction payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary: <em>Provided further</em>, That interest reduction payments may be made with respect to a mortgage or part thereof on a rental or cooperative housing project owned by a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend entity, public&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_2_target" name="1715z-1_2">2</a></sup> entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. The term &ldquo;mortgage insurance premium&rdquo;, when used in this section in relation to a project financed by a loan under a State or local program, means such fees and charges, approved by the Secretary, as are payable by the mortgagor to the State or local agency mortgagee to meet reserve requirements and administrative expenses of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest reduction payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a project owner shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the project owner as a mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such project owner would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgage handling expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (c) of this section, as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of project in accordance with requirements respecting tenant eligibility and rents prescribed by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As a condition for receiving the benefits of interest reduction payments, the project owner shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe. Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for review of tenant incomes at intervals of one year (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A project for which interest reduction payments are made under this section and for which the mortgage on the project has been refinanced shall continue to receive the interest reduction payments under this section under the terms of the contract for such payments, but only if the project owner enters into such binding commitments as the Secretary may require (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration that is not less than the term for which such interest reduction payments are made plus an additional 5 years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The basic rental charge shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal and interest due under a mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 1 percent per annum; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (ii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit, reduced by the value of the interest reduction payments subsidy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The fair market rental charge shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage covering the project; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit that exceeds the minimum amounts permitted by this subparagraph for such charges only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the approved basic rental charge and fair market rental charges each exceed the applicable minimum charge by the same amount; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the project owner agrees to restrictions on project use or mortgage prepayment that are acceptable to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(v) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge under this paragraph for a unit with assistance under section 1437f of title 42 that differs from the basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit in the same project that is similar in size and amenities but without such assistance, as needed to ensure equitable treatment of tenants in units without such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the fair market rental charge determined pursuant to subparagraph (A), as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of a project which contains more than 5000 units, is subject to an interest reduction payments contract, and is financed under a State or local project, the Secretary may reduce the rental charge ceiling, but in no case shall the rental charge be below the basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For plans of action approved for capital grants under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [12 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.] or the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, the rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the minimum basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) or such greater amount, not exceeding the lower of: (I) the fair market rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(iii)(I); or (II) the actual rent paid for a comparable unit in comparable unassisted housing in the market area in which the housing assisted under this section is located, as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) With respect to those projects which the Secretary determines have separate utility metering paid by the tenants for some or all dwelling units, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) permit the basic rental charge and the fair market rental charge to be determined on the basis of operating the project without the payment of the cost of utility services used by such dwelling units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) permit the charging of a rental for such dwelling units at such an amount less than 30 percent of a tenant's adjusted income as the Secretary determines represents a proportionate decrease for the utility charges to be paid by such tenant, but in no case shall rental be lower than 25 percent of a tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any project made subject to a contract under this section after August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall make, and contract to make, additional assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of tenants whose incomes are too low for them to afford the basic rentals (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) with 30 per centum of their adjusted income. The additional assistance payments authorized by this paragraph with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the amount required to reduce the rental payment (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) by the tenant to the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary to assure the economic viability of the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary and feasible in order to, assure, insofar as is practicable, that there is in the project a reasonable range in the income levels of tenants, or that such action is to be taken to meet the housing needs of elderly or handicapped families.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall utilize amounts credited to the fund described in subsection (g) of this section for the sole purpose of carrying out the purposes of section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. No payments may be made from such fund unless approved in an appropriation Act. No amount may be so approved for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To ensure that eligible tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this subsection immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into under this subsection with owners of projects assisted but not subject to mortgages insured under this section to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of eligible tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under section 1437c(c) of title 42. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on <!-- PDFPage:667 -->a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In order to induce advances by owners for capital improvements (excluding any owner contributions that may be required by the Secretary as a condition for assistance under section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978) to benefit projects assisted under this section, in establishing basic rental charges and fair market rental charges under paragraph (1) the Secretary may include an amount that would permit a return of such advances with interest to the owner out of project income, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine. Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are to provide assistance to restore or maintain the financial soundness, to assist in the improvement of the management, to permit capital improvements to be made to maintain certain projects as decent, safe, and sanitary housing, and to maintain the low- to moderate-income character of certain projects assisted or approved for assistance under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], the Housing Act of 1959, or the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, without regard to whether such projects are insured under the National Housing Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability of financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may make available, and contract to make available, to such extent and in such amounts as may be approved in appropriation Acts, financial assistance to owners of rental or cooperative housing projects meeting the requirements of this section. Such assistance shall be made on an annual basis and in accordance with the provisions of this section, without regard to whether such projects are insured under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A rental or cooperative housing project is eligible for assistance under this section only if such project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) is assisted under section 236 [12 U.S.C. 1715z&ndash;1] or the proviso of section 221(d)(5) of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715<em>l</em>(d)(5)], or under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 [12 U.S.C. 1701s], or received a loan under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 [12 U.S.C. 1701q] more than 15 years before the date on which assistance is made available under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is assisted under section 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1421b], as in effect immediately before January 1, 1975, section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] following conversion to such assistance from assistance under section 236 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715z&ndash;1] or section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 [12 U.S.C. 1701s]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) met the criteria specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph before the acquisition of such project by the Secretary and has been sold by the Secretary, subject to a mortgage insured or held by the Secretary and subject to an agreement (in effect during the period of assistance under this section) which <!-- PDFPage:677 -->provides that the low- and moderate-income character of the project will be maintained; except that, with respect to projects sold after October 1, 1978, assistance shall be available for a period not to exceed three years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) meets such other requirements consistent with the purposes of this section as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No assistance may be made available under this section unless the Secretary has determined that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such assistance, when considered with other resources available to the project, is necessary and, in the determination of the Secretary, will restore or maintain the financial or physical soundness of the project and maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project, and the owner has agreed to maintain the low- and moderate-income character of such project for a period at least equal to the remaining term of the project mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the assistance which could reasonably be expected to be provided over the useful life of the project will be less costly to the Federal Government than other reasonable alternatives by which the Secretary could maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the owner of the project, together with the mortgagee in the case of a project not insured under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], has provided or has agreed to provide assistance to the project in such manner as the Secretary may determine;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the project is or can reasonably be made structurally sound, as determined on the basis of information obtained as a result of an onsite inspection of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the management of the project is being conducted by persons who meet minimum levels of competency and experience prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the project is being operated and managed in accordance with a management-improvement-and-operating plan which is designed to reduce the operating costs of the project, which has been approved by the Secretary, and which includes the following: (A) a detailed maintenance schedule; (B) a schedule for correcting past deficiencies in maintenance, repairs, and replacements; (C) a plan to upgrade the project to meet cost-effective energy efficiency standards prescribed by the Secretary; (D) a plan to improve financial and management control systems; (E) a detailed annual operating budget taking into account such standards for operating costs in the area as may be determined by the Secretary; and (F) such other requirements as the Secretary may determine; except that the Secretary may excuse an owner from compliance with the plan requirement set forth in this paragraph in any case in which such owner seeks only assistance for capital improvements under this section; and except that the Secretary shall review and approve or disapprove each plan not later than the expiration of the 30-day period beginning upon the date of submission of the plan to the Secretary by the owner, but if the Secretary fails to inform the owner of approval or disapproval of the plan within such period the plan shall be considered to have been approved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) all reasonable attempts have been made to take all appropriate actions and provide suitable housing for project residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the project has a feasible plan to involve the residents in project decisions;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the real estate taxes on the project are or will be no greater than would be the case if the property were assessed in a manner consistent with normal property assessment procedures for the community; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Amount of financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may, with respect to any year, provide assistance under this section, and make commitments to provide such assistance, with respect to any project (except a project assisted only for capital improvements) in any amount which the Secretary determines is consistent with the project's management-improvement-and-operating plan described in subsection (d)(6) of this section and which does not exceed the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to correct deficiencies in the project which exist at the beginning of the first year with respect to which assistance is made available for the project under this section, which were caused by the deferral of regularly scheduled maintenance and repairs or the failure to make necessary and timely replacements of equipment and other components of the project, and for which payment has not previously been made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project by reducing deficiencies, which exist at the beginning of the first year with respect to which assistance is made available for the project under this section and for which payment has not previously been made, in the reserve funds established by the project owner for the purpose of replacing capital items;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an amount not greater than the amount by which the estimated operating expenses (as described in paragraph (2) of this subsection) for the year with respect to which such assistance is made available exceeds the estimated revenues to be received (as described in para<!-- PDFPage:678 -->graph (2) of this subsection) by the project during such year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) an amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to carry out a plan to upgrade the project to meet cost-effective energy efficiency standards prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The estimated revenues for any project under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection with respect to any year shall be equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the estimated amount of rent which is to be expended by the tenants of such project during such year, as determined by the Secretary without regard to section 236(f)(1) of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715z&ndash;1(f)(1)];</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) in computing the estimated amount of rent to be expended by tenants, the Secretary shall provide that (i) at least 25 percent (or such lesser percentage as is provided for under any other Federal housing assistance program in which such tenant is participating) of the income of each such tenant is included, or (ii) in the case of a tenant paying his or her own utilities, a percentage of income which is less than 25 percent and which takes into account the reasonable costs of such utilities; except that no amount shall be provided for any tenant under clause (i) or (ii) which exceeds the fair market rental charge as determined pursuant to section 236(f)(1) of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715z&ndash;1(f)(1)] for such tenant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) in computing the estimated amount of rent to be expended by tenants and the estimated amount of rental assistance payments to be made on behalf of such tenants, the Secretary may permit a delinquency-and-vacancy allowance of not more than 6 per centum of the estimated amount of such rent and payments computed without regard to such allowance; except that, with respect to the first three years in which assistance is provided to a project under this section, the Secretary may permit such allowance for such project to exceed such 6 percent by an amount which the Secretary determines is appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of computing estimated operating expenses of any such project with respect to any year, the Secretary shall include all estimated operating costs which the Secretary determines to be necessary and consistent with the management-improvement-and-operating plan for the project for such year, including, but not limited to, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs (except for maintenance and repairs which should have been performed in previous years), management, insurance, debt service, and payments made by the owner for the purpose of establishing or maintaining a reserve fund for replacement costs.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may provide assistance for capital improvements under this section if the Secretary finds that the reserve funds established by the owner of a project for the purpose of making capital improvements are insufficient to finance both the capital improvements for which such assistance is to be used and other capital improvements that are reasonably expected to be required in the near future, and such insufficiency is not the result of the failure of such owner to comply with any standard established by the Secretary for management of such reserve funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Amount of assistance for capital improvements; term of loan; rate of interest; allowance for administrative costs and probable program losses; nondischargeable liability; other forms for loans</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to help provide adequate housing for families of low and moderate income, including those who, for reasons of credit history, irregular income patterns caused by seasonal employment, or other factors, are unable to meet the credit requirements of the Secretary for the purchase of a single-family home financed by a mortgage insured under section 1709, 1715k, 1715<em>l</em>, 1715y, or 1715z(j)(4) of this title, but who, through the incentive of homeownership and counseling assistance, appear to be able to achieve homeownership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization to insure mortgages meeting requirements of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized upon application by the mortgagee to insure under this section not more than 26 percent of the total principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) of any mortgage meeting the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees, as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed $70,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) be executed by a mortgagor who the Secretary has determined, after a full and complete study of the case, would not be an acceptable credit risk for mortgage insurance purposes under sections 1709, 1715k, 1715<em>l</em>, 1715y, or 1715z(j)(4) of this title, because of his credit standing, debt obligations, total annual income, or income characteristics, but who the Secretary is satisfied would be a reasonably satisfactory credit risk, consistent with the objectives stated in subsection (a) of this section, if he were to receive budget, debt management, and related counseling, prior to and during the 12 months immediately following the purchase of the property, from a community development financial institution under section 4702(5) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That, in determining whether the mortgagor is a reasonably satisfactory credit risk, the Secretary shall review the credit history of the applicant giving special consideration to those delinquent accounts which were ultimately paid by the applicant and to extenuating factors which may have caused credit accounts of the applicant to become delinquent; and the Secretary shall also give special consideration to income characteristics of applicants whose total income over the two years prior to their applications has remained at levels of eligibility (as required under paragraph (4) of this subsection), but who, because of the character of this seasonal employment or for other reasons, have not maintained continuous employment under one employer during that time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) require monthly payments which, in combination with local real estate taxes on the property involved, do not exceed 36 per centum of the applicant's income, based on his average monthly income during the year prior to his application or the average monthly income during the three years prior to his application, whichever is higher; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) require the mortgagor to be subject, if necessary, to a default mitigation effort undertaken by an intermediary community development financial institution under section 4702(5) of this title, that is acting as a sponsor and pass-through of insurance under section 1709 of this title and is approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) involve a total principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) that is not more than 90 percent of the value of the property for which the mortgage is provided; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) involve a total principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in which the mortgagor has equity (as defined by the Secretary) of not less than 10 percent and such equity shall be subordinate to the interest of the Secretary in the mortgaged property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preferences in approving mortgage insurance applications and in providing counseling services; eligible families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall give preference in approving mortgage insurance applications and in providing counseling services under this section (1) to families which are eligible for assistance payments under section 1715z of this title, (2) to families living in empowerment zones and enterprise communities (as those terms are defined in section 1393(b) of title 26&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-2_2_target" name="1715z-2_2">2</a></sup> who are eligible for homeownership assistance, and (3) to families living in public housing units, especially those families required to leave public housing because their incomes have risen beyond the maximum prescribed income limits, and families eligible for residence in public housing who have been displaced from federally assisted urban renewal areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Budget, debt management, and related counseling services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to provide, or contract with community development financial institutions under section 4702(5) of this title to provide, such budget, debt management, and related counseling services to mortgagors whose mortgages are insured under this section as he determines to be necessary to meet the objectives of this section. The Secretary may also provide such counseling to otherwise eligible families who lack sufficient funds to supply a <!-- PDFPage:688 -->down payment to help them to save an amount necessary for that purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Aggregate principal balance of mortgages insured</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate principal balance of the portions of mortgages insured under this section and outstanding at one time shall not exceed $200,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Premium fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Mortgages insured under this section shall be subject to an insurance premium fee of not more than 1.25 percent of the total mortgage principal obligation (including such initial service charges, and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Assumption of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before insuring a mortgage under this section, the Secretary shall enter into such contracts or other agreements as may be necessary to ensure that the mortgagee or other holder of the mortgage shall assume not less than 10 percent and not more than 50 percent of any loss on the insured mortgage, subject to any reasonable limit on the liability of the mortgagee or holder of the mortgage that may be specified in the event of unusual or catastrophic losses that may be incurred by any one mortgagee or mortgage holder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No guarantees may be issued under section 1721(g) of this title for the timely payment of interest or principal on securities backed, in whole or in part, by mortgages insured under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Action to recover assets or income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may request the Attorney General to bring an action in a United States district court to recover any assets or income used by any person in violation of (A) a regulatory agreement that applies to a multifamily project whose mortgage is insured or held by the Secretary under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]; (B) a regulatory agreement that applies to a multifamily project whose mortgage is insured or held by the Secretary under section 1701q of this title (including property subject to section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990); (C) a regulatory agreement or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary that applies to mortgages insured or held by the Secretary under section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, but not reinsured under section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992; or (D) any applicable regulation. For purposes of this section, a use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation shall include any use for which the documentation in the books and accounts does not establish that the use was made for a reasonable operating expense or necessary repair of the project and has not been maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary and in reasonable condition for proper audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of a mortgage insured or held by the Secretary under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.], under section 1701q of this title (including section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990) and under section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, the term &ldquo;any person&rdquo; shall mean any person or entity which owns a project, as identified in the regulatory agreement, including but not limited to any stockholder holding 25 percent or more interest of a corporation that owns the project; any beneficial owner under any business or trust; any officer, director, or partner of an entity owning the project; and any heir, assignee, successor in interest, or agent of any owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation of proceedings and temporary relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General, upon request of the Secretary, shall have the exclusive authority to <!-- PDFPage:691 -->authorize the initiation of proceedings under this section. Pending final resolution of any action under this section, the court may grant appropriate temporary or preliminary relief, including restraining orders, injunctions, and acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, to protect the interests of the Secretary and to prevent use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, and any applicable regulation and to prevent loss of value of the realty and personalty involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount recoverable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any judgment favorable to the United States entered under this section, the Attorney General may recover double the value of the assets and income of the project that the court determines to have been used in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation, plus all costs relating to the action, including but not limited to reasonable attorney and auditing fees. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may apply the recovery, or any portion of the recovery, to the project or to the applicable insurance fund under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] or, in the case of any project for which the mortgage is held by the Secretary under section 1701q of this title (including property subject to section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990), to the project or to the Department for use by the appropriate office within the Department for administrative costs related to enforcement of the requirements of the various programs administered by the Secretary, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to bring an action under this section at any time up to and including 6 years after the latest date that the Secretary discovers any use of project assets and income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not exceed an amount which the Secretary determines is necessary for the purchase and installation of individual utility meters plus an amount which the Secretary deems appropriate taking into account amounts which will be saved in operation costs over the period of repayment of the loan by reducing the energy requirements of the project as a result of the installation of energy conserving improvements or a solar energy system therein;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be insured for 90 percent of any loss incurred by the person holding the note for the loan; except that, for cooperative multifamily projects receiving assistance under section 1715z&ndash;1 of this title or financed with a below market interest rate mortgage insured under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) of this title, 100 percent of any such loss may be insured;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination by Secretary of necessity; interest subsidy payments; effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever he determines such action to be necessary in furtherance of the purposes set forth in section 501 of the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of families of middle income. The assistance shall be accomplished through interest subsidy payments to the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the investor&rdquo;) with respect to mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section and made after July 24, 1970.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications of mortgagor for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for assistance payments a middle-income family shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which is (1) insured under subsection (j) of this section, (2) guaranteed under chapter 37 of title 38, or (3) a conventional mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (j)(3) of this section. In addition to the foregoing requirement, the Secretary may require that the mortgagor have an income, at the time of acquisition of the property, of not more than the median income for the area in which the property is located, as determined by the Secretary, with appropriate adjustments for smaller and larger families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of interest subsidy payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest subsidy payments authorized by this section shall cease when (1) the mortgagor no longer occupies the property which secures the mortgage, (2) the mortgages are no longer held by the investor, or (3) the rate of interest paid by the mortgagor reaches the rate of interest specified on the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Monthly mortgage payments as determining eligibility for interest subsidy payments; mortgage assistance payments for middle-income cooperative members; interest subsidy payments; applicability of provisions to cooperative mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Interest subsidy payments shall be on mortgages on which the mortgagor makes monthly payments towards principal and interest equal to an amount which would be required if the mortgage bore an effective interest rate of 7 per centum per annum including any discounts or charges in the nature of points or otherwise (but not including premiums, if any, for mortgage insurance) or such higher rate (not to exceed the rate specified in the mortgage), which the mortgagor could pay by applying at least 20 per centum of his income towards homeownership expenses. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;monthly homeownership expense&rdquo; includes the monthly payment for principal, interest, mortgage insurance premium, insurance, and taxes due under the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the mortgages eligible for assistance under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments on behalf of cooperative members of middle income. Such assistance payments shall be accomplished through interest subsidy payments to the investor with respect to mortgages insured (subsequent to July 24, 1970) under section 1715e of this title which are executed by cooperatives, the membership in which is limited to middle-income families. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a cooperative mortgagor, subsection (c) of this section shall not apply and the interest subsidy payments shall cease when the mortgage is no longer held by the investor or the cooperative fails to limit membership to families whose incomes at the time of their application for a dwelling unit meets such requirements as are laid down by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of interest subsidy payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest subsidy payments shall be in an amount equal to the difference, as determined by the Secretary, between the total amount of interest per calendar quarter received by the investor on mortgages assisted under this section and purchased by it and the total amount of interest which the investor would have received if the yield on such mortgages was equal to the sum of (1) the average costs (expressed as an annual percentage rate) to it of all borrowed funds outstanding in the immediately preceding calendar quarter, and (2) such per centum per annum as will provide for administrative and other expenses of the investor and a reasonable economic return, as determined by the Secretary to be necessary and appropriate taking <!-- PDFPage:699 -->into account the purpose of this section to provide additional mortgage credit at reasonable rates of interest to middle-income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Adoption of procedures for recertifications of mortgagor's income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertifications of the mortgagor's income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of the mortgagor's payments pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations to assure that sales price or other consideration paid is not increased above appraised value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not increased above the appraised value on which the maximum mortgage which the Secretary will insure is computed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of assistance payment contracts; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to make interest subsidy payments under contracts entered into under this section. The aggregate amount of contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $105,000,000 during the first year of such contracts prior to July 1, 1971, which amount shall be increased by an additional $105,000,000 during the first year of an additional number of such contracts on July 1 of each of the years 1971 and 1972.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No interest subsidy payments under this section shall be made after June 30, 1973, except pursuant to contracts entered into on or before such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Determination of family income; exclusion of income of minors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the income of any family for the purposes of this section, income from all sources of each member of the family in the household shall be included, except that the Secretary shall exclude income earned by any minor person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In addition to providing insurance as otherwise authorized under this chapter, and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter inconsistent with this section, the Secretary, upon request of any mortgagee and for such mortgage insurance premium as he may prescribe (which premium, or other charges to be paid by the mortgagor, shall not exceed the premium, or other charges, that would otherwise be applicable), may insure and make a commitment to insure under any provision of this subchapter any mortgage, advance, or loan otherwise eligible under such provision, pursuant to a co-insurance contract providing that the mortgagee will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assume a percentage of any loss on the insured mortgage, advance, or loan in direct proportion to the amount of the co-insurance, which co-insurance shall not be less than 10 per centum, subject to any reasonable limit or limits on the liability of the mortgagee that may be specified in the event of unusual or catastrophic losses that may be incurred by any one mortgagee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) carry out (under a delegation or otherwise and with or without compensation but subject to audit, exception, or review requirements) such credit approval, appraisal, inspection, commitment, property disposition, or other functions as the Secretary, pursuant to regulations, shall approve as consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any contract of co-insurance under this section shall contain such provisions relating to the sharing of premiums on a sound actuarial basis, establishment of mortgage reserves, manner of calculating insurance benefits, conditions with respect to foreclosure, handling and disposition of property prior to claim or settlement, rights of assignees (which may elect not to be subject to the loss sharing provisions), and other similar matters as the Secretary may prescribe pursuant to regulations. A mortgagee which enters into a contract of co-insurance under this section shall not by reason of such contract, or its adherence to such contract or applicable regulations of the Secretary, including provisions relating to the retention of risks in the event of sale or assignment of a mortgage, be made subject to any State law regulating the business of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inspection of construction of dwellings or projects as prerequisite; minimum standards or criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No insurance shall be granted pursuant to this section with respect to dwellings or projects approved for insurance prior to the beginning of construction unless the inspection of such construction is conducted in accordance with at least the minimum standards and criteria used with respect to dwellings or projects approved for mortgage insurance pursuant to other provisions of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability unaffecting insurance otherwise authorized; criteria for exercise of authority by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not withdraw, deny, or delay insurance otherwise authorized under any other provision of this chapter by reason of the availability of insurance pursuant to this section.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Multifamily housing project; contract provisions; aggregate principal amount of all mortgages insured; loans on defaulted mortgages; insurance for state assisted projects and projects under construction; definitions; amount of reserves</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make loans, from the applicable insurance fund, to public housing agencies in connection with mortgages which have been insured pursuant to this subsection and which are in default.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary may include in the determination of replacement cost of a project to be covered by a mortgage made to a public housing agency and insured pursuant to this <!-- PDFPage:701 -->subsection, such reserves and development costs, not to exceed 5 per centum of the amount otherwise allowable, as may be established or authorized by the public housing agency consistent with such agency's procedures and underwriting standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Redesignated (f)</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Acceptable co-insurance provisions for rental rehabilitation; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the case of a mortgage insured under section 1715n(f) of this title secured by property which is to be rehabilitated or developed under section 1437<em>o</em>&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-9_1_target" name="1715z-9_1">1</a></sup> of title 42, such co-insurance may include provisions that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) insurance benefits shall equal the sum of (A) 90 per centum of the mortgage on the date of institution of foreclosure proceedings (or on the date of acquisition of the property otherwise after default), and (B) 90 per centum of interest arrears on the date benefits are paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the mortgagee shall remit to the Secretary, for credit to the General Insurance Fund, 90 per centum of any proceeds of the property, including sale proceeds, net of the mortgagee's actual and reasonable costs related to the property and the enforcement of security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) payment of such benefits shall be made in cash unless the mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the underwriter of co-insurance may reinsure 10 per centum of the mortgage amount with a private mortgage insurance company or with a State mortgage insurance agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-9_2_target" name="1715z-9_2">2</a></sup> Authority of mortgagee to assign its interest in any note or mortgage subject to a contract of co-insurance; terms and conditions respecting retention of co-insurance risk of such note or mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee which enters into a contract of co-insurance under this section shall have the authority to assign its interest in any note or mortgage subject to a contract of co-insurance to a warehouse bank or other financial institution which provides interim funding for a loan co-insured under this section, and to retain the co-insurance risk of such note or mortgage, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>

Such requirements shall include the minimum capital or net worth of mortgagees; the ratio that mortgagees shall maintain between the mortgagee's capital and the volume of mortgages co-insured by such mortgagee; and such other requirements as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure the long-term financial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration funds. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on the review and assessment under the previous sentence, and an explanation of the Secretary's reasons for making any adjustment in requirements authorized under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria; principal obligation limitation; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter mortgages and loans with provisions of varying rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in family income or with monthly payments and outstanding balances adjusted by a percentage change in a selected price index to the extent he determines such mortgages or loans (1) have promise for expanding housing opportunities or meet special needs, (2) can be developed to include any safeguards for mortgagors or purchasers that may be necessary to offset special risks of such mortgages, and (3) have a potential for acceptance in the private market. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the principal obligation (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) of a mortgage insured pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 97 per centum of the appraised value of the property covered by the mortgage as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, or if the mortgagor is a veteran and the mortgage is to be insured in accordance with the provisions of section 1709 of this title, such higher percentage of appraised value as is provided for purposes of determining the maximum mortgage amount eligible for insurance under section 1709(b)(2) of this title in the case of veterans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inapplicability of principal obligation limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage or loan which meets the requirements of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and which has provisions for varying rates of amortization if the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the mortgagor could not reasonably afford to purchase the dwelling unit by means of a mortgage insured under subsection (a) of this section or any other mortgage insurance program under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan initially does not exceed the percentage of the initial appraised value of the property specified in section 1709(b) of this title as of the date the mortgage or loan is accepted for insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan thereafter (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) will not at any time be scheduled to exceed 97 per centum, or, if the mortgagor is a veteran, such higher percentage as is provided under section 1709(b)(2) of this title for veterans, of the projected value of the property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the principal obligation of the mortgage thereafter will not exceed 113 per centum of the initial appraised value of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Mortgage insurance under this subsection shall be limited to mortgages executed by mortgagors who, as determined by the Secretary, have not owned dwelling units within the preceding three years. For the purpose of this subsection, the projected value of the property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the initial appraised value of the property at a rate not in excess of 21/2 per centum per annum. The number of mortgages which are insured in accordance with this subsection in any fiscal year may not exceed (A) that number of mortgages the aggregate initial principal obligation of which equals 10 per centum of the aggregate amount of the initial principal obligation of all mortgages secured by properties improved by one- to four-family residences which are insured under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year, or (B) 50,000 mortgages, whichever is greater. No loan or mortgage may be insured under this subsection after February 5, 1988, except pursuant to a commitment to insure entered into on or before February 5, 1988.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mortgages with monthly adjustments based on selected price index; priority; regulations; number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage or loan that meets the requirements of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and that has provisions permitting adjustment of monthly payments and outstanding principal according to changes or percentages of changes in a selected price index if the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan initially does not exceed the percentage of the initial appraised value of the property specified in section 1709(b) of this title as of the date the mortgage or loan is accepted for insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the monthly payments and principal obligation of the mortgage or loan thereafter will not at any time be increased at a rate greater than the percentage change in the price index stipulated in the initial mortgage or loan contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall give a priority to mortgages executed by mortgagors who, as determined by the Secretary, have not owned dwelling units within the preceding 3 years. The Secretary shall, not later than March 31, 1984, prescribe regulations establishing guidelines governing mortgages and loans described in this subsection and shall, to the extent practicable, conduct a demonstration program to insure mortgages and loans in accordance with this subsection during fiscal years 1984 and 1985. The aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured under this subsection and section 1715z&ndash;17 of this title in any fiscal year may not exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Multifamily housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may insure, under any provision of this subchapter relating to multifamily housing projects, mortgages and loans with provisions of varying rates of amortization cor<!-- PDFPage:704 -->responding to anticipated variations in project income, to the extent the Secretary determines such mortgages or loans (A) have promise for expanding housing opportunities or meet special needs; (B) can be developed to include any safeguards for mortgagors, tenants, or purchasers that may be necessary to offset special risks of such mortgages; and (C) have a potential for acceptance in the private market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the principal obligation of a mortgage or loan insured pursuant to this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may not exceed initially the percentage of the initial appraised value or replacement cost of the property involved that is required by the provision of this subchapter under which such property is insured; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) thereafter (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) may not at any time be scheduled to exceed 100 percent of the projected value of such property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the projected value of a property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the initial appraised value of such property at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Inapplicability of State constitution, etc., provision limiting interest or requiring minimum amortization of principal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage or loan insured pursuant to this section which contains or sets forth any graduated mortgage provisions (including but not limited to provisions for adding deferred interest to principal) which are authorized under this section and applicable regulations, or which have been insured on the basis of their being so authorized, shall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, or rule or public policy (1) limiting the amount of interest which may be charged, taken, received, or reserved, or the manner of calculating such interest (including but not limited to prohibitions against the charging of interest on interest), if such constitution, statute, court decree, common law, or rule would not apply to the mortgage or loan in the absence of such graduated payment mortgage provisions, or (2) requiring a minimum amortization of principal under the mortgage or loan.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) One- to four-family residence; eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, subject to such special conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, may insure under any provision of this subchapter that authorizes such insurance, a mortgage covering a property upon which there is located a one- to four-family residence, without regard to any limitation in this chapter relating to marketability of title or any other limitation in this chapter that the Secretary determines is contrary to promoting the availability of such insurance on Indian reservations if the mortgage (1) is executed by an Indian tribe and the property is located on trust or otherwise restricted land; or (2) is executed by a member of an Indian tribe who will use the property as a principal residence and the property is on trust or otherwise restricted land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction advances; percentage limitation on amount of principal obligation; pledge of income from tribal resources or assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, with respect to mortgages covering a property upon which there is located a one- to four-family residence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may insure and make commitments to insure under this subchapter pursuant to this section advances made during construction where the Secretary determines that the proposed construction is otherwise acceptable and meets an applicable tribal or national model building code, and that no feasible financing alternative is available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the applicable percentage limitation on the amount of the principal obligation of a mortgage based on the appraised value or replacement cost, as appropriate, of a one- to four-family owner-occupied residence contained in this subchapter shall apply in the case of all mortgages insured pursuant to this section without regard to whether the residences are owner-occupied where the residences are owned by the tribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) the Secretary may require an Indian tribe, only as a condition of insurance made under this subchapter pursuant to this section, to pledge income from tribal resources or income from tribal assets not subject to a restriction by the Secretary of the Interior or pledge grants under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] or any other Federal grant program administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to be used to reimburse the Secretary for any mortgage insurance claims paid in connection with residences insured pursuant to this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an individual Indian mortgagor, the Secretary may require a pledge of his or her share of distributed income from tribal resources or income from tribal assets, excluding any Federal grants received by the tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lack of tribal or trust fund income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not refuse to insure a mortgage under this section to an individual home purchaser because there is no distributed tribal or trust fund income attributable to that purchaser.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Availability of tribal eviction procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before making any commitment to insure a mortgage under this section with respect to property located on trust or otherwise restricted land, the Secretary shall require a showing by the tribe that it has adopted eviction procedures to be used in the event of a default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assumption of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage insured under this section may be assumed, subject to credit approval by the lender and the consent of the tribe to an assumption of the existing lease or the grant of a new lease, without an adjustment of the interest rate. Any other sale of a property subject to a mortgage insured under this section may be made only if a new lease is granted, except that a sale following a foreclosure may be accompanied by an assumption of the lease with the consent of the tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Insurance of mortgage as obligation of General Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the insurance of a mortgage using the authority contained in this section shall be the obligation of the General Insurance Fund established in section 1735c of this title. The mortgagee shall be eligible to receive the benefits of insurance as provided in section 1710 of this title with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section, except that (1) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund; and (2) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to the section under which the mortgage is insured.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Availability of status and payment history of loans; entitlement to benefit of insurance; reinstatement of loan upon cure of default; garnishment proceedings; foreclosure proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall make information regarding the status and payment history of loans insured under this section available to local credit bureaus and prospective creditors. Prior to accepting assignment of a mortgage, the Secretary shall require mortgagees to submit documentation that mortgagors have been counseled in a face-to-face interview, informed of the provisions of this subsection or other available assistance, and provided with the names and addresses of officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to whom further communications shall be addressed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the requirement for conveyance of title under section 1710 of this title, a mortgagee under this section shall be entitled to receive the benefit of insurance under this section in the case of a mortgage which is more than 90 days in default upon conveyance of the lease agreement and the mortgage documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that any default is cured, the Secretary shall seek to reinstate the loan with the mortgagee or another mortgagee. For purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary may provide appropriate financial incentives to rein<!-- PDFPage:708 -->state the loan commensurate with sound management of the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary determines that a mortgagor is not making a good-faith effort to cure a default, and that trust fund or tribal income is available under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall commence proceedings for the garnishment of the mortgagor's distributed share of tribal or trust fund income in order to collect loan payments that are past due. Proceedings under this paragraph may be instituted in a tribal court, court of competent jurisdiction designated by the tribe, or Federal district court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Secretary determines such action is necessary to protect the General Insurance Fund from undue loss, the Secretary may initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to any mortgage acquired under this subsection. Such proceeding may take place in a tribal court, a court of competent jurisdiction, or Federal district court. Any such court shall have jurisdiction to convey to the Secretary the remaining life of a lease on the real property and to order eviction of the delinquent mortgagor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Premium charge for insurance; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the administration of this section, the Secretary shall establish a premium charge for insurance that will be sufficient to cover the full costs of the mortgage insurance program under this section, except that such charge may not exceed 3 percent per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage outstanding at any time. Not later than September 30, 1984, the Secretary shall determine and report to the Congress on the feasibility of eliminating any excess amount of the premium under this section over the premium under section 1709 of this title. In the event such premiums are not sufficient to cover the full costs of the mortgage insurance program under this section, the Secretary shall make recommendations to the Congress about changes to the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Indian tribe&rdquo; and &ldquo;trust or otherwise restricted land&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;Indian tribe&rdquo; means any Indian or Alaska native tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians or Alaska natives recognized as eligible for the services provided to Indians or Alaska natives by the Secretary of the Interior because of its status as such an entity, or that was an eligible recipient under chapter 67 of title 31, prior to the repeal of such chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;trust or otherwise restricted land&rdquo; means (A) that area of land, as defined by the Secretary of the Interior, over which an Indian tribe is recognized by the United States as having governmental jurisdiction; (B) land held in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation; or (C) land acquired by Alaska natives under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] or any other land acquired by Alaska natives pursuant to statute by virtue of their unique status as Alaska natives.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide access to sources of private financing to Indian families, Indian housing authorities, and Indian tribes, who otherwise could not acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of Indian lands or as a result of a lack of access to private financial markets, the Secretary may guarantee not to exceed 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest due on any loan eligible under subsection (b) of this section made to an Indian family, Indian housing authority, or Indian tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans guaranteed pursuant to this section shall meet the following requirements:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Lenders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall be made only by a lender approved by and meeting qualifications established by the Secretary, except that loans otherwise insured or guaranteed by an agency of the Federal Government or made by an organization of Indians from amounts borrowed from the United States shall not be eligible for guarantee under this section. The following lenders are deemed to be approved under this paragraph:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bear interest (exclusive of the guarantee fee under section 404&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-13a_2_target" name="1715z-13a_2">2</a></sup> and service charges, if any) at a rate agreed upon by the borrower and the lender and determined by the Secretary to be reasonable, which may not exceed the rate generally charged in the area (as determined by the Secretary) for home mortgage loans not guaranteed or insured by any agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) involve a principal obligation not exceeding&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard for approval</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certificate of guarantee issued under this paragraph by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guarantee under the provisions of this section and the amount of such guarantee. Such evidence shall be incontestable in the hands of the bearer and the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts agreed to be paid by the Secretary as security for such obligations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Fraud and misrepresentation</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:710 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disqualification of lenders and civil money penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any lender or holder of a guarantee certificate under subsection (c) of this section has failed to maintain adequate accounting records, to adequately service loans guaranteed under this section, to exercise proper credit or underwriting judgment, or has engaged in practices otherwise detrimental to the interest of a borrower or the United States, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bar such lender or holder from acquiring additional loans guaranteed under this section; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the event of default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall provide written notice of the default to the Secretary. Upon providing such notice, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall be entitled to payment under the guarantee (subject to the provisions of this section) and may proceed to obtain payment in one of the following manners:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The holder of the certificate may initiate foreclosure proceedings (after providing written notice of such action to the Secretary) and upon a final order by the court authorizing foreclosure and submission to the Secretary of a claim for payment under the guarantee, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the certificate the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined pursuant to subsection (e) of this section) plus reasonable fees and expenses as approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee and the lender holder shall assign the obligation and security to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) No foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Without seeking foreclosure (or in any case in which a foreclosure proceeding initiated under clause (i) continues for a period in excess of 1 year), the holder of the guarantee may submit to the Secretary a request to assign the obligation and security interest to the Secretary in return for payment of the claim under the guarantee. The Secretary may accept assignment of the loan if the Secretary determines that the assignment is in the best interests of the United States. Upon assignment, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the guarantee the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined under subsection (e) of this section). The Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee and the holder shall assign the obligation and security to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before any payment under a guarantee is made under subparagraph (A), the holder of the guarantee shall exhaust all reasonable possibilities of collection. Upon payment, in whole or in part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States. The Secretary shall then take such action to collect as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>

If the mortgagee or the Secretary subsequently proceeds to liquidate the account, the mortgagee or the Secretary shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the property except to one of the entities described in the preceding sentence.</p>

Such interest rate adjustments may be accomplished through adjustments in the monthly payment amount, the outstanding principal balance, or the mortgage term, or a combination of these factors, except that in no case may any extension of a mortgage term result in a total term in excess of 40 years. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall correspond to a specified national interest rate index approved in regulations by the Secretary, information on which is readily accessible to mortgagors from generally available published sources. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall (1) be made on an annual basis; (2) be limited, with respect to any single interest rate increase, to no more than 1 percent on the outstanding loan balance; and (3) be limited to a maximum increase of 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate over the term of the mortgage.</p>

The term of the mortgage shall not be less than 15 years, and shall be repayable in equal monthly installments of principal and fixed interest during the mortgage term in an amount which would be sufficient to retire a debt with the same principal and fixed interest rate over a period not exceeding 30 years. In the case of a mortgage which will not be completely amortized during the mortgage term, the principal obligation of the mortgage may not exceed 85 percent of the estimated value of the property or project. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;net appreciated value&rdquo; means the amount by which the sales price of the property (less the mortgagor's selling costs) exceeds the actual project cost after completion, as approved by the Secretary. If there has been no sale or transfer at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable, the sales price for purposes of this section shall be determined by means of an appraisal conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the Secretary and provided for in the mortgage.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to meet the special needs of elderly homeowners by reducing the effect of the economic hardship caused by the increasing costs of meeting health, housing, and subsistence needs at a time of reduced income, through the insurance of home equity conversion mortgages to permit the conversion of a portion of accumulated home equity into liquid assets; and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may delegate, to one or more mortgagees approved by the Secretary under the direct endorsement program, the authority of the Secretary under this chapter to insure mortgages involving property upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for occupancy by 1 to 4 families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether to delegate authority to a mortgagee under this section, the Secretary shall consider the experience and performance of the mortgagee compared to the default rate of all insured mortgages in comparable markets, and such other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate to minimize risk of loss to the insurance funds under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement of insurance requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a mortgage insured by a mortgagee pursuant to delegation of authority under this section was not originated in accordance with the requirements established by the Secretary, and the Secretary pays an insurance claim with respect to the mortgage within a reasonable period specified by the Secretary, the Secretary may require the mortgagee approved under this section to indemnify the Secretary for the loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fraud or misrepresentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If fraud or misrepresentation was involved in connection with the origination, the Secretary may require the mortgagee approved under this section to indemnify the Secretary for the loss regardless of when an insurance claim is paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Termination of mortgagee's authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a mortgagee to which the Secretary has made a delegation under this section violates the requirements and procedures established by the Secretary or the Secretary determines that other good cause exists, the Secretary may cancel a delegation of authority under this section to the mortgagee by giving notice to the mortgagee. Such a cancellation shall be effective upon receipt of the notice by the mortgagee or at a later date specified by the Secretary. A decision by the Secretary to cancel a delegation shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Requirements and procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before approving a delegation under this section, the Secretary shall issue regulations establishing appropriate requirements and procedures, including requirements and procedures governing the indemnification of the Secretary by the mortgagee.</p>
