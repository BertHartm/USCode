<p class="statutory-body">(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3912_1_target" name="3912_1">1</a></sup> To ensure that Congress is fully informed of the risks to our banking system posed by troubled foreign loans, the Federal banking agencies, before March 31, 1989, and on April 30 of each succeeding year, shall jointly submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives a report that shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The level of loan exposure of those banking institutions under the jurisdiction of each agency which is rated &ldquo;value-impaired&rdquo;, &ldquo;substandard&rdquo;, &ldquo;other transfer risk problems&rdquo;, or in any other troubled debt category as may be established by the banking agencies. This tabulation shall clearly identify aggregate loan exposures of the 9 largest United States banks under the agencies&rsquo; jurisdiction, the aggregate loan exposures of the next 13 largest banks, and the aggregate exposure of all other such banks which have significant country risk exposures. This tabulation shall include a separate section identifying, to the extent feasible, new bank loans to countries with debt service problems which were made within the past year preceding the date on which the report required under this subsection is due, and shall include the amount of sovereign loans written off or sold by such banks during the preceding year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Progress that has been achieved by the appropriate Federal banking agencies and by banking institutions in reducing the risk to the economy of the United States posed by the exposure of banking institutions to troubled international loans through appropriate voluntary or regulatory policies, including increases in capital and reserves of banking institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The relationship between lending activity by the United States banks and foreign banks in countries experiencing debt service difficulties and exports from the United States and other lending countries to these markets, and the extent to which United States banking institutions can be encouraged to continue to make credit available to finance necessary growth in international trade, and particularly to finance United States exports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The response of regulatory agencies in other countries to the international debt problems, including measures which encourage the building of capital and reserves by foreign banking institutions, tax treatment of reserves, encouragement of new lending to promote international trade, and measures which may place United States banking institutions at a competitive disadvantage when compared with foreign banking institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Steps that have been taken during the previous year by countries experiencing debt service difficulties to enhance conditions for private direct investment (including investment by United States persons) and to eliminate production subsidies, attain price stability, and undertake such other steps as will remove the causes of their debt service difficulties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Each appropriate Federal banking agency may provide data in the aggregate to the extent necessary to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of the regulatory and examination process.</p>
