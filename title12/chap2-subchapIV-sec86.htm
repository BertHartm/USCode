In case the greater rate of interest has been paid, the person by whom it has been paid, or his legal representatives, may recover back, in an action in the nature of an action of debt, twice the amount of the interest thus paid from the association taking or receiving the same: <em>Provided</em>, That such action is commenced within two years from the time the usurious transaction occurred.</p>
