<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil money penalties under subsection (a) of this section. These standards and procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall provide for the Secretary to make the determination to impose the penalty or to use an administrative entity (such as the Mortgagee Review Board, established pursuant to section 1708(c) of this title) to make the determination;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of the penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination.

If the Secretary does not review the determination or order within 90 days of the issuance of the determination or order, the determination or order shall be final.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reviewability of imposition of penalty</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Objections not raised in hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The court shall not consider any objection that was not raised in the hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection. If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that additional evidence not presented at the hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the court shall remand the matter to the Secretary for consideration of the additional evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Scope of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The decisions, findings, and determinations of the Secretary shall be reviewed pursuant to section 706 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any such review, the court shall have the power to order payment of the penalty imposed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Action to collect penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any mortgagee or lender fails to comply with the Secretary's determination or order imposing a civil money penalty under subsection (a) of this section, after the determination or order is no longer subject to review as provided by subsections (c)(1) and (d) of this section, the Secretary may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in an appropriate United States district court to obtain a monetary judgment against the mortgagee or lender and such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in the court's discretion, include the attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary's determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Settlement by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed under this section.</p>
