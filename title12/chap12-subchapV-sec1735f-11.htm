<p class="statutory-body">(a) To reduce losses in connection with mortgage insurance programs under this chapter, the Secretary shall review, at least once a year, the rate of early serious defaults and claims involving mortgagees approved under this chapter. On the basis of this review, the Secretary shall notify each mortgagee which, as determined by the Secretary, had a rate of early serious defaults and claims during the preceding year which was higher than the normal rate for the geographic area or areas in which that mortgagee does business. In the notification, the Secretary shall require each mortgagee to submit a report, within a time determined by the Secretary, containing the mortgagee's (1) explanation for the above normal rate of early serious defaults and claims; (2) plan for corrective action, if applicable, both with regard to (A) mortgages in default; and (B) its mortgage-processing system in general; and (3) a timeframe within which this corrective action will be begun and completed. If the Secretary does not agree with this timeframe or plan, a mutually agreeable timeframe and plan will be determined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Failure of the mortgagee to submit a report required under subsection (a) of this section within the time determined by the Secretary or to commence or complete the plan for corrective action within the timeframe agreed upon by the Secretary may be cause for suspension of the mortgagee from participation in programs under this chapter.</p>
