<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount in Fund not exceeding secure base amount</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If at the end of any calendar year the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund does not exceed the secure base amount, subject to paragraph (2), the annual premium due from any insured System bank for the calendar year shall be equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annual average principal outstanding for such year on loans made by the bank that are in accrual status, excluding the guaranteed portions of government-guaranteed loans provided for in subparagraph (C), multiplied by 0.0015;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the annual average principal outstanding for such year on loans made by the bank that are in nonaccrual status, multiplied by 0.0025; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) the annual average principal outstanding for such year on the guaranteed portions of Federal Government-guaranteed loans made by the bank that are in accrual status, multiplied by 0.00015; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the annual average principal outstanding for such year on the guaranteed portions of State government-guaranteed loans made by the bank that are in accrual status, multiplied by 0.0003.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation, in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may reduce by a percentage uniformly applied to all insured System banks the annual premium due from each insured System bank during any calendar year, as determined under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Government-guaranteed loans&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this section and section 2020(b) of this title, the term &ldquo;government-guaranteed loans&rdquo; means loans or credits, or portions of loans or credits, that are guaranteed&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount in Fund exceeding secure base amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the secure base amount, the Corporation shall reduce the annual premium due from each insured System bank, as determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section, by a percentage determined by the Corporation so that the aggregate of the premiums payable by all System banks is sufficient to ensure that the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund after such premiums are paid is not less than the secure base amount at such time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Secure base amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;secure base amount&rdquo; means, with respect to any point in time, 2 percent of the aggregate outstanding insured obligations of all insured System banks at such time (adjusted downward to exclude an amount equal to the sum of (1) 90 percent of the guaranteed portions of principal outstanding on Federal Government-guaranteed loans in accrual status made by such banks and (2) 80 percent of the guaranteed portions of principal outstanding on State government-guaranteed loans in accrual status made by such banks, as determined by the Corporation), or such other percentage of the aggregate amount as the Corporation in its sole discretion determines is actuarially sound to maintain in the Insurance Fund taking into account the risk of insuring outstanding insured obligations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of principal outstanding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of subsections (a), (c), and (e) of this section, the principal outstanding on all <!-- PDFPage:1236 -->loans made by an insured System bank shall be determined based on all loans made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by any production credit association, or any other association making direct loans under authority provided under section 2279b of this title, that is able to make such loans because such association is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by any bank, company, institution, corporation, union, or association described in section 2015(b)(1)(B) of this title, that is able to make such loans because such entity is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by such insured System bank (other than loans made to any party described in paragraph (1) or (2)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allocation to System institutions of excess reserves</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, at the end of any calendar year, the aggregate of the amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the average secure base amount for the calendar year (as calculated on an average daily balance basis), the Corporation shall allocate to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts the excess amount less the amount that the Corporation, in its sole discretion, determines to be the sum of the estimated operating expenses and estimated insurance obligations of the Corporation for the immediately succeeding calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Allocation formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the total amount required to be allocated at the end of a calendar year under paragraph (3)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 10 percent of the total amount shall be credited to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account established under paragraph (1)(B), subject to paragraph (6)(C); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there shall be credited to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account of each insured System bank an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount (less any amount credited under subparagraph (A)) as the average principal outstanding for the 3-year period ending on the end of the calendar year on loans made by the bank that are in accrual status bears to the average principal outstanding for the 3-year period ending on the end of the calendar year on loans made by all insured System banks that are in accrual status (excluding, in each case, the guaranteed portions of government-guaranteed loans described in subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Use of funds in Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the sum of the operating expenses of the Corporation and the insurance obligations of the Corporation for a calendar year exceeds the sum of operating expenses and insurance obligations determined under paragraph (3) for the calendar year, the Corporation shall cover the expenses and obligations by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reducing each Allocated Insurance Reserves Account by the same proportion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expending the amounts obtained under subparagraph (A) before expending other amounts in the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Other disposition of Account funds</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Authority to eliminate or reduce payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation may eliminate or reduce payments during a calendar year under subparagraph (A) if the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that the payments, or other circumstances that might require use of the Farm Credit Insurance Fund, could cause the amount in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund during the calendar year to be less than the secure base amount.</p>
