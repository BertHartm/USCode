<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the Farm Credit Administration determines, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, on the basis of the evaluation required under clause (i), that the redemption of such stock at par value would impair the other stock or equities of such institution or render such institution incapable of meeting its capital adequacy standards, the institution shall be prohibited from redeeming the preferred stock it issued under section 2278b&ndash;7 of this title with respect to the maturing obligation. If the Farm Credit Administration determines, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, on the basis of the evaluation required under clause (i), that such institution will be able to redeem, in a timely manner and at par value, the preferred stock it issued under section 2278b&ndash;7 of this title with respect to the maturing obligation, and remain a viable and competitive institution, such institution shall have the option of redeeming or not redeeming such stock. If such institution is prohibited from redeeming or elects not to redeem such stock, the Financial Assistance Corporation shall withdraw funds from the Trust Fund in an amount equal to the par value of the preferred stock issued by such institution under section 2278b&ndash;7 of this title so as to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to pay the principal of the maturing obligation. Simultaneously with such withdrawal of funds from the Trust Fund, the Financial Assistance Corporation shall transfer to the Insurance Fund an equal amount, at par value, of preferred stock of such institution. To the extent that the Trust Fund is insufficient to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to pay the full principal of the maturing obligation, the Insurance Fund shall be used by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation to purchase, at par value, the preferred stock issued by such institution under section 2278b&ndash;7(a) of this title to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to pay the principal of the maturing obligation. To the extent that the Insurance Fund is insufficient to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to pay the full principal of the maturing obligation, the Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase, at par value, the remaining quantity of the preferred stock issued by such institution to enable the Financial Assistance Corporation to make such full payment. For that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury may use, as a public debt transaction, the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include such purchases of stock. Any preferred stock transferred to, or purchased by, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation under this clause shall be retired by the issuing institution at such times and under such terms and conditions as are agreed to between the Insurance Corporation and such institution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Recourse by other System banks</h4>

If the Secretary has not recovered the full amount due from the defaulting bank by the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of payment by the Secretary, the uncollected amount shall be paid to the Secretary from the Insurance Fund established under section 2277a&ndash;9 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Principal of bonds issued to fund purchase of preferred stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In each instance in which the Secretary of the Treasury is required under paragraph (3)(B)(iii) to purchase preferred stock issued by a System institution under section 2278b&ndash;7(a) of this title, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall use funds deposited in the Insurance Fund to repurchase, at par value, from the Secretary of the Treasury such stock required to be purchased under paragraph (3)(B)(iii) as funds become available for such repurchase.</p>
