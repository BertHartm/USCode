<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Borrowing money; issuing bonds and debentures; general powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power, subject to rules and regulations prescribed by the Board, to borrow and give security therefor and to pay interest thereon, to issue debentures, bonds, or other obligations upon such terms and conditions as the Board may approve, and to do all things necessary for carrying out the provisions of this chapter and all things incident thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of consolidated Federal Home Loan Bank debentures; restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may issue consolidated Federal Home Loan Bank debentures which shall be the joint and several obligations of all Federal Home Loan Banks organized and existing under this chapter, in order to provide funds for any such bank or banks, and such debentures shall be issued upon such terms and conditions as the Board may prescribe. No such debentures shall be issued at any time if any of the assets of any Federal Home Loan Bank are pledged to secure any debts or subject to any lien, and neither the Board nor any Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to pledge any of the assets of any Federal Home Loan Bank, or voluntarily to permit any lien to attach to the same while any of such debentures so issued are outstanding. The debentures issued under this section and outstanding shall at no time exceed five times the total paid-in capital of all the Federal Home Loan Banks as of the time of the issue of such debentures. It shall be the duty of the Board not to issue debentures under this section in excess of the notes or obligations of member institutions held and secured under section 1430(a) of this title by all the Federal Home Loan Banks.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Issuance of Federal Home Loan Bank bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time that no debentures are outstanding under this chapter, or in order to refund all outstanding consolidated debentures issued under this section, the Board may issue consolidated Federal Home Loan Bank bonds which shall be the joint and several obligations of all the Federal Home Loan Banks, and shall be secured and be issued upon such terms and conditions as the Board may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional or substituted collateral on adjustment of equities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Board may, subject to such rules and regulations, including definitions of terms used in this paragraph, as the Board shall from time to time prescribe, authorize Federal Home Loan Banks to be drawees of, and to engage in, or be agents or intermediaries for, or otherwise participate or assist in, the collection and settlement of (including presentment, clearing, and payment of, and remitting for), checks, drafts, or any other negotiable or nonnegotiable items or instruments of payment drawn on or issued by members of any Federal Home Loan Bank or by institutions which are eligible to make application to become members pursuant to section 1424 of this title, and to have such incidental powers as the Board shall find necessary for the exercise of any such authorization.</p>

In prescribing such rules and regulations, the Board may adopt or apply, in whole or in part, general banking usage and practices, and, in instances or respects in which they would otherwise not be applicable, Federal Reserve regulations and operating letters, the Uniform Commercial Code, and clearinghouse rules.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rediscount of notes held by other banks; purchase of bonds of other banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board is authorized and empowered to permit,,<sup><a href="#1431_1_target" name="1431_1">1</a></sup> to require,<sup><a href="#1431_1_target" name="1431_1">1</a></sup> Federal Home Loan Banks, upon such terms and conditions as the Board may prescribe, to rediscount the discounted notes of members held by other Federal Home Loan Banks, or to make loans to, or make deposits with, such other Federal Home Loan Banks, or to purchase any bonds or debentures issued under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reserves</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Investment of surplus funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such part of the assets of each Federal Home Loan Bank (except reserves and amounts provided for in subsection (g) of this section) as are not required for advances to members, may be invested, to such extent as the bank may deem desirable and subject to such regulations, restrictions, and limitations as may be prescribed by the Board, in obligations of the United States, in obligations, participations, or other instruments of or issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Government National Mortgage Association, in mortgages, obligations, or other securities which are or ever have been sold by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation pursuant to section 1454 or section 1455 of this title, in the stock of the Federal National Mortgage Association, in stock, obligations, or other securities of any small business investment company formed pursuant to section 681 of title 15, for the purpose of aiding members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and in such securities as fiduciary and trust funds may be invested in under the laws of the State in which the Federal Home Loan Bank is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Treasury purchase of banks&rsquo; obligations; exercise of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized in his discretion to purchase any obligations issued pursuant to this section, as heretofore, now, or hereafter in force and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, are extended to include such purchases. The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as he shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this subsection shall be treated as public-debt transactions of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this paragraph if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of his then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this paragraph to an amount greater than $4,000,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and shall bear such rate of interest as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield for the month preceding the month of such purchase on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to obligations authorized to be purchased by the preceding paragraph, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase any obligations issued pursuant to this section in amounts not to exceed $2,000,000,000. The authority provided in this paragraph shall expire August 10, 1975.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority provided in this subsection may be exercised during any calendar quarter beginning after October 28, 1974, only if the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairperson of the Board certify to the Congress that (1) alternative means cannot be effectively employed to permit members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System to continue to supply reasonable amounts of funds to the mortgage market, and (2) the ability to supply such funds is substantially impaired because of monetary stringency and a high level of interest rates. Any funds borrowed under this subsection shall be repaid by the Home Loan Banks at the earliest practicable date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9105(a)(1)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1431_2_target" name="1431_2">2</a></sup> of title 31, audits by the General Accounting Office of the financial transactions <!-- PDFPage:277 -->of a Federal Home Loan Bank shall not be limited to periods during which Government capital has been invested therein.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Interest on and security for such loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any loan by a Federal Home Loan Bank pursuant to paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) bear a rate of interest not less than such Bank's current marginal cost of funds, taking into account the maturities involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be adequately secured.</p>
