In one city in each Federal Reserve District there is located a Federal Reserve Bank; in 10 of the Districts there are one or more branches of the Federal Reserve Bank in other cities; and in some Districts there are offices or facilities with specialized functions. Each Federal Reserve Bank is a separate legal entity, created pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act and operating under the general supervision of the Board. The locations of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the 25 branches and the boundaries of the Federal Reserve district and branch territories are shown in the appendix. Each Federal Reserve Bank, in addition to its other duties, carries out local functions for the Board pursuant to instructions of the Board, and in many matters acts as the Board's field representative in the Bank's District. Each Reserve <!-- PDFPage:83 -->Bank assists in the regional administration of the Board's regulations and policies, keeps the Board informed of local conditions, and recommends such actions as it thinks appropriate in particular cases. In general, persons concerned with Federal Reserve matters should deal in the first instance with the Federal Reserve Bank of the appropriate District or a branch thereof, and the Board requests all persons to follow this procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Federal Reserve agents</em>. Each Federal Reserve Bank has nine directors, three of whom are appointed by the Board. One of the directors appointed by the Board is designated by the Board as chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank and as Federal Reserve agent. He acts as the Board's official representative and maintains a local office of the Board on the premises of the Federal Reserve bank.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">SECTION 5&mdash;Delegations of Authority</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Board does not delegate any of its functions relating to rule-making or pertaining principally to monetary or credit policies or involving any questions of general policy. However, the Board delegates certain of its supervisory and other functions prescribed by statute or regulations of the Board to its members or employees or to the Federal Reserve Banks as provided in its Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority (12 CFR 265). In addition, the Board delegates to the Federal Reserve Banks certain functions not provided for by statute or regulations of the Board, including authority to extend the time within which certain transactions may be consummated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. In furtherance of the purposes of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 [15 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.], the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 20 and July 20 of each year, independent written reports setting forth (1) a review and analysis of recent developments affecting economic trends in the Nation, including an analysis of the impact of the exchange rate of the dollar on those trends; (2) the objectives and plans of the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee with respect to the ranges of growth or diminution of the monetary and credit aggregates for the calendar year during which the report is transmitted, taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices; and (3) the relationship of the aforesaid objectives and plans to the short-term goals set forth in the most recent Economic Report of the President pursuant to section 1022(a)(2)(A) of title 15 and to any short-term goals approved by the Congress. In addition, as a part of its report on July 20 of each year, the Board of Governors shall include a statement of its objectives and plans with respect to the ranges of growth or diminution of the monetary and credit aggregates for the calendar year following the year in which the report is submitted. The reports required under the two preceding sentences shall be transmitted to the Congress and shall be referred in the Senate to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and in the House of Representatives to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs. The Board shall consult with each such Committee on the reports and, thereafter, each such Committee shall submit to its respective body a report containing its views and recommendations with respect to the Federal Reserve's intended policies. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to require that the objectives and plans with respect to the ranges of growth or diminution of the monetary and credit aggregates disclosed in the reports submitted under this section be achieved if the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee determine that they cannot or should not be achieved because of changing conditions: <em>Provided</em>, That in the subsequent consultations with, and reports to, the aforesaid Committees of the Congress pursuant to this section, the Board of Governors shall <!-- PDFPage:85 -->include an explanation of the reasons for any revisions to or deviations from such objectives and plans.</p>
