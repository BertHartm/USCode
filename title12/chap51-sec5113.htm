<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cease and desist proceeding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of this chapter, or any regulation thereunder, with respect to a State which is subject to a licensing system established by the Secretary under section 5107 of this title, the Secretary may publish such findings and enter an order requiring such person, and any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation, to cease and desist from committing or causing such violation and any future violation of the same provision, rule, or regulation. Such order may, in addition to requiring a person to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such provision or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and within such time as the Secretary may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the Secretary deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for such period of time as the Secretary may specify, with such provision or regulation with respect to any loan originator.</p>

Such an order shall be entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, unless the Secretary determines that notice and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest. A temporary order shall become effective upon service upon the respondent and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the proceedings.</p>

A respondent served with a temporary cease and desist order entered without a prior hearing before the Secretary may not apply to the court except after hearing and decision by the Secretary on the respondent's application under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No automatic stay of temporary order</h4>
