<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to cause a significant depletion of the core capital of the enterprise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) otherwise to cause irreparable harm to the enterprise,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to section 4631(c) of this title, the Director may issue a temporary order requiring the enterprise, executive officer, or director to cease and desist from any such conduct or violation and to take affirmative action to prevent or remedy such insolvency, depletion, or harm pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under section 4631(d) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall become effective upon service upon the enterprise, executive officer, or director and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall remain in effect and enforceable pending the completion of the proceedings pursuant to such notice and shall remain effective until the Director dismisses the charges specified in the notice or until superseded by a cease-and-desist order issued pursuant to section 4631 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Incomplete or inaccurate records</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a notice of charges served under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title specifies on the basis of particular facts and circumstances that the books and records of the enterprise served are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Director is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of the enterprise or the details or the purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that enterprise, the Director may issue a temporary order requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) affirmative action to restore the books or records to a complete and accurate state.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any temporary order issued under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall become effective upon service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall remain in effect and enforceable until the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the completion of the proceeding initiated under section 4631 of this title in connection with the notice of charges; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the date the Director determines, by examination or otherwise, that the books and records of the enterprise are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An enterprise, executive officer, or director that has been served with a temporary order pursuant to this section may apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia within 10 days after such service for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of the order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the enterprise, executive officer, or director under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title. Such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary order issued pursuant to this section, the Director may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an injunction to enforce such order or may, under the direction and control of the Attorney General, bring such an action. If the court finds any such violation, threatened violation, or failure to obey, the court shall issue such injunction.</p>
