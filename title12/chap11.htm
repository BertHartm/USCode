<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Capital standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 18 months after November 12, 1999, the Finance Board shall issue regulations prescribing uniform capital standards applicable to each Federal home loan bank, which shall require each such bank to meet&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the leverage requirement specified in paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the risk-based capital requirements, in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Leverage requirement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The leverage requirement shall require each Federal home loan bank to maintain a minimum amount of total capital based on the total assets of the bank and shall be 5 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of stock and retained earnings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining compliance with the minimum leverage ratio established under subparagraph (A), the paid-in value of the outstanding Class B stock and the amount of retained earnings shall be multiplied by 1.5, and such higher amounts shall be deemed to be capital for purposes of meeting the 5 percent minimum leverage ratio, except that a Federal home loan bank's total capital (determined without taking into account any such multiplier) shall not be less than 4 percent of the total assets of the bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Risk-based capital standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each Federal home loan bank shall maintain permanent capital in an amount that is sufficient, as determined in accordance with the regulations of the Finance Board, to meet&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the credit risk to which the Federal home loan bank is subject; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the market risk, including interest rate risk, to which the Federal home loan bank is subject, based on a stress test established by the Finance Board that rigorously tests for changes in market variables, including changes in interest rates, rate volatility, and changes in the shape of the yield curve.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consideration of other risk-based standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the risk-based standard under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Finance Board shall take due consideration of any risk-based capital test established pursuant to section 1361 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4611) for the enterprises (as defined in that Act [12 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.]), with such modifications as the Finance Board determines to be appropriate to reflect differences in operations between the Federal home loan banks and those enterprises.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other regulatory requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued by the Finance Board under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) permit each Federal home loan bank to issue, with such rights, terms, and preferences, not inconsistent with this chapter and the regulations issued hereunder, as the board of directors of that bank may approve, any 1 or more of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Class A stock, which shall be redeemable in cash and at par 6 months following submission by a member of a written notice of its intent to redeem such shares; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Class B stock, which shall be redeemable in cash and at par 5 years following submission by a member of a written notice of its intent to redeem such shares;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide that the stock of a Federal home loan bank may be issued to and held by only members of the bank, and that a bank may not issue any stock other than as provided in this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) prescribe the manner in which stock of a Federal home loan bank may be sold, transferred, redeemed, or repurchased; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) provide the manner of disposition of outstanding stock held by, and the liquidation of any claims of the Federal home loan bank against, an institution that ceases to be a member of the bank, through merger or otherwise, or that provides notice of intention to withdraw from membership in the bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definitions of capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining compliance with the capital standards established under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) permanent capital of a Federal home loan bank shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The capital structure plan of each Federal home loan bank shall impose a continuing obligation on the board of directors of the bank to review and adjust the minimum investment required of each member of that bank, as necessary to ensure that the bank remains in compliance with applicable minimum capital levels established by the Finance Board, and shall require each member to comply promptly with any adjustments to the required minimum investment.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Excess stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Shares of stock held by a member shall not be deemed to be &ldquo;excess stock&rdquo; for purposes of this subsection by virtue of a member's submission of a notice of intent to withdraw from membership or termination of its membership in any other manner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Federal home loan bank may not redeem any excess Class B stock prior to the end of the 5-year notice period, unless the member has no Class A stock outstanding that could be redeemed as excess.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Impairment of capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Finance Board or the board of directors of a Federal home loan bank determines that the bank has incurred or is likely to incur losses that result in or are expected to result in charges against the capital of the bank, the bank shall not redeem or repurchase any stock of the bank without the prior approval of the Finance Board while such charges are continuing or are expected to continue.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Number; appointment and election; qualifications; conflicts of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The management of each Federal home loan bank shall be vested in a board of fourteen directors, eight of whom shall be elected by the members as hereinafter provided in this section and six of whom shall be appointed by the Board referred to in section 1422a of this title, all of whom shall be citizens of the United States, and each of whom shall be either a bona fide resident of the district in which such bank is located or an officer or director of a member of such bank located in that district: <em>Provided</em>, That in any district which includes five or more States the Board may by regulation increase the elective directors to a number not exceeding thirteen and may increase the appointive directors to a number not exceeding three-fourths the number of elective directors: <em>Provided further</em>, That if at any time the number of elective directors in the case of any district is not at least equal to the number of States in such district the Board shall exercise the authority conferred by the next preceding proviso so as to increase such elective directors to a number at least equal to the number of States in such district. At least 2 of the Federal Home Loan Bank directors who are appointed by the Board shall be representatives chosen from organizations with more than a 2-year history of representing consumer or community interests on banking services, credit needs, housing, or financial consumer protections. No Federal Home Loan Bank director who is appointed pursuant to this subsection may, during such Bank director's term of office, serve as an officer of any Federal Home Loan Bank or a director or officer of any member of a Bank, or hold shares, or any other financial interest in, any member of a Bank.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:266 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Elective directorships; qualifications; nominations and election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each elective directorship shall be designated by the Board as representing the members located in a particular State, and shall be filled by a person who is an officer or director of a member located in that State, each of which members shall be entitled to nominate an eligible person for such directorship, and such office shall be filled from such nominees by a plurality of the votes which such members may cast in an election held for the purpose of filling such office, in which election each such member may cast for such office a number of votes equal to the number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held by such member at the end of the calendar year next preceding the election, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Board, but not in excess of the average number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held at the end of such calendar year by the respective members of such bank located in such State, as so determined. No person who is an officer or director of a member that fails to meet any applicable capital requirement is eligible to hold the office of Federal Home Loan Bank director. As used in this subsection and in subsection (c) of this section, the term &ldquo;member&rdquo; means a member of a Federal home loan bank which was a member of such bank at the end of such calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Apportionment among States in bank district; designation of State location</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The number of elective directorships designated as representing the members located in each separate State in a bank district shall be determined by the Board in the approximate ratio of the percentage of the required stock, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Board, of the members located in that State at the end of the calendar year next preceding the date of the election to the total required stock, as so determined, of all members of such bank at the end of such year, except that in the case of each State such number shall not be less than one and shall not be more than six. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if at any time the number of elective directorships so designated as representing the members located in any State would not be at least equal to the total number of elective directorships which, on December 31, 1960, were filled by officers or directors of members whose principal places of business were located in such State, the Board shall add to the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State is located such number of elective directorships, and shall so designate the directorship or directorships thus added, that the number of elective directorships designated as representing the members located in such State will equal said total number. Any elective directorship so added shall exist only until the expiration of its first term. The Board shall, with respect to each member of a Federal home loan bank, designate the State in the district of such bank in which such member shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be located, and may from time to time change any such designation, but if the principal place of business of any such member is located in a State of such district it shall be the duty of the Board to designate such State as the State in which such member shall, for said purposes, be deemed to be located. As used in the second sentence of this subsection, the term &ldquo;total number of elective directorships&rdquo; means the total number of elective directorships on the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State was located on December 31, 1960, and the term &ldquo;members&rdquo; where used for the second time in such sentence means members of such bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms; rules and regulations governing nominations and elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term of each director, whether elected or appointed, shall be 3 years. The board of directors of each Federal home loan bank and the Finance Board shall adjust the terms of members first elected or appointed after November 12, 1999, to ensure that the terms of the members of the board of directors are staggered with approximately 1/3 of the terms expiring each year. If any person, before or after, or partly before and partly after, September 8, 1961, has been elected to each of three consecutive full terms as an elective director of a Federal home loan bank in any elective directorship or elective directorships and has served for all or part of each of said terms, such person shall not be eligible for election to an elective directorship of such bank for a term which begins earlier than two years after the expiration of the last expiring of said three terms. The Board is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the nomination and election of directors of Federal home loan banks, including, without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, rules and regulations with respect to the breaking of ties and with respect to the inclusion of more than one directorship on a single ballot and the methods of voting and of determining the results of voting in such cases.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Each term, outstanding on the effective date of the amendment to this section abolishing the division of elective directors into classes, of an elective or appointive directorship then existing shall continue until its original date of expiration, and any elective or appointive directorship in existence on said date shall continue to exist to the same extent as if it had been established by or under this section on or after said date. The Board in its discretion may shorten the next succeeding term of any such elective directorship to one year, and may fill such term by appointment. The term &ldquo;States&rdquo; or &ldquo;State&rdquo; as used in this section shall mean the States of the Union, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Board, by regulation or otherwise, may add an additional elective directorship to the board of directors of the bank of any district in which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is included at the time such directorship is added and which does not then include five or more States, may fix the commencement and the duration, which shall not exceed two years, of the initial term of any directorship so added, and may fill any such ini<!-- PDFPage:267 -->tial term by appointment: <em>Provided</em>, That (1) any directorship added pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall be designated by the Board, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, as representing the members located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, (2) such designation of such directorship shall not be changed, and (3) such directorship shall automatically cease to exist if and when the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ceases to be included in such district.</p>

If any such examination shall indicate, in the opinion of the Board, that under the laws of any such State or the regulations or procedure thereunder there would be inadequate protection to a Federal Home Loan Bank in making or collecting advances under this chapter, the Board may withhold or limit the operation of any Federal Home Loan Bank in such State until satisfactory conditions of law, regulation, or procedure shall be established. In any State where State examination of members or nonmember borrowers is deemed inadequate for the purposes of the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Board shall establish such examination, all or part of the cost of which may be considered as part of the cost of making advances in such State. The banks and/or the Board may make studies of trends of home and other property values, methods of appraisals, and other subjects such as they may deem useful for the general guidance of their policies and operations and those of institutions authorized to secure advances.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) All advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Federal Home Loan Bank is authorized to make secured advances to its members upon collateral sufficient, in the judgment of the Bank, to fully secure advances obtained <!-- PDFPage:270 -->from the Bank under this section or section 1431(g) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purposes of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A long-term advance may only be made for the purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) providing funds to any member for residential housing finance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) providing funds to any community financial institution for small businesses, small farms, and small agri-businesses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bank, at the time of origination or renewal of a loan or advance, shall obtain and maintain a security interest in collateral eligible pursuant to one or more of the following categories:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Fully disbursed, whole first mortgages on improved residential property (not more than 90 days delinquent), or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the United States Government or any agency thereof (including without limitation, mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Corporation, and the Government National Mortgage Association).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Cash or deposits of a Federal Home Loan Bank.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Other real estate related collateral acceptable to the Bank if such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and the Bank can perfect its interest in the collateral.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Secured loans for small business, agriculture, or securities representing a whole interest in such secured loans, in the case of any community financial institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional bank authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (3) shall not affect the ability of any Federal Home Loan Bank to take such steps as it deems necessary to protect its security position with respect to outstanding advances, including requiring deposits of additional collateral security, whether or not such additional security would be eligible to originate an advance. If an advance existing on August 9, 1989, matures and the member does not have sufficient eligible collateral to fully secure a renewal of such advance, a Bank may renew such advance secured by such collateral as the Bank determines is appropriate. A member that has an advance secured by such insufficient eligible collateral must reduce its level of outstanding advances promptly and prudently in accordance with a schedule determined by the Federal home loan bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of certain collateral standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may review the collateral standards applicable to each Federal home loan bank for the classes of collateral described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (3), and may, if necessary for safety and soundness purposes, require an increase in the collateral standards for any or all of those classes of collateral.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;small business&rdquo;, &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;, &ldquo;small farm&rdquo;, and &ldquo;small agri-business&rdquo; shall have the meanings given those terms by regulation of the Finance Board.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appraisals and other investigations; acceptance of home mortgages as collateral security only by formal Board resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, each Home Loan Bank shall have power to make, or to cause or require to be made, such appraisals and other investigations as it may deem necessary. No home mortgage otherwise eligible to be accepted as collateral security for an advance by a Home Loan Bank shall be accepted if any director, officer, employee, attorney or agent of the Home Loan Bank or of the borrowing institution is personally liable thereon, unless the Board has specifically approved by formal resolution such acceptance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notes of borrowing members; interest rate; lien on stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such advances shall be made upon the note or obligation of the member secured as provided in this section, bearing such rate of interest as the Federal home loan bank may approve or determine, and the Federal Home Loan Bank shall have a lien upon and shall hold the stock of such member as further collateral security for all indebtedness of the member to the Federal Home Loan Bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Obligation to repay; additional security; sale of advances to other banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The institution applying for an advance shall enter into a primary and unconditional obligation to pay off all advances, together with interest and any unpaid costs and expenses in connection therewith according to the terms under which they were made, in such form as shall meet the requirements of the bank. The bank shall reserve the right to require at any time, when deemed necessary for its protection, deposits of additional collateral security or substitutions of security by the borrowing institution, and each borrowing institution shall assign additional or substituted security when and as so required. Any Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to sell to any other Federal Home Loan Bank, with or without recourse, any advance made under the provisions of this chapter, or to allow to such bank a participation therein, and any other Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to purchase such advance or to accept a participation therein, together with an appropriate assignment of security therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Priority of certain secured interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any security interest granted to a Federal Home Loan Bank by any member of any Federal Home Loan Bank or any affiliate of any such member shall be entitled to priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than claims and rights that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:271 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) are held by actual bona fide purchasers for value or by actual secured parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1430_1_target" name="1430_1">1</a></sup> Community support requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the end of the 2-year period beginning on August 9, 1989, the Board shall adopt regulations establishing standards of community investment or service for members of Banks to maintain continued access to long-term advances.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors to be included</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) shall take into account factors such as a member's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 [12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.] and the member's record of lending to first-time homebuyers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special liquidity advances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the Federal Home Loan Banks may, upon the request of the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, make short-term liquidity advances to a savings association that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is solvent but presents a supervisory concern because of such association's poor financial condition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has reasonable and demonstrable prospects of returning to a satisfactory financial condition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest on and security for special liquidity advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any loan by a Federal Home Loan Bank pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be subject to all applicable collateral requirements, including the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, and shall be at an interest rate no less favorable than those made available for similar short-term liquidity advances to savings associations that do not present such supervisory concern.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Community investment program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Bank shall establish a program to provide funding for members to undertake community-oriented mortgage lending. Each Bank shall designate a community investment officer to implement community lending and affordable housing advance programs of the Banks under this subsection and subsection (j) of this section and provide technical assistance and outreach to promote such programs. Advances under this program shall be priced at the cost of consolidated Federal Home Loan Bank obligations of comparable maturities, taking into account reasonable administrative costs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Community-oriented mortgage lending</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;community-oriented mortgage lending&rdquo; means providing loans&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to finance home purchases by families whose income does not exceed 115 percent of the median income for the area,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to finance purchase or rehabilitation of housing for occupancy by families whose income does not exceed 115 percent of median income for the area,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to finance commercial and economic development activities that benefit low- and moderate-income families or activities that are located in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to finance projects that further a combination of the purposes described in subparagraphs (A) through (C).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Affordable housing program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Board, each Bank shall establish an Affordable Housing Program to subsidize the interest rate on advances to members engaged in lending for long term, low- and moderate-income, owner-occupied and affordable rental housing at subsidized interest rates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board's regulations shall permit Bank members to use subsidized advances received from the Banks to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) finance homeownership by families with incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income for the area; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) finance the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of rental housing, at least 20 percent of the units of which will be occupied by and affordable for very low-income households for the remaining useful life of such housing or the mortgage term.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priorities for making advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In using advances authorized under paragraph (1), each Bank member shall give priority to qualified projects such as the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) purchase of homes by families whose income is 80 percent or less of the median income for the area,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) purchase or rehabilitation of housing owned or held by the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) purchase or rehabilitation of housing sponsored by any nonprofit organization, any State or political subdivision of any State, any local housing authority or State housing finance agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each member receiving advances under this program shall report annually to the Bank making such advances concerning the member's use of advances received under this program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Contribution to program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Bank shall annually contribute the percentage of its annual net earnings prescribed in the following subparagraphs to support subsidized advances through the Affordable Housing Program:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993, 5 percent of the preceding year's net income, or such prorated sums as may be required to assure that the aggregate contribution of all the Banks shall not be less than $50,000,000 for each such year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:272 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In 1994, 6 percent of the preceding year's net income, or such prorated sum as may be required to assure that the aggregate contribution of the Banks shall not be less than $75,000,000 for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) In 1995, and subsequent years, 10 percent of the preceding year's net income, or such prorated sums as may be required to assure that the aggregate contribution of the Banks shall not be less than $100,000,000 for each such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Grounds for suspending contributions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a Bank finds that the payments required under this paragraph are contributing to the financial instability of such Bank, it may apply to the Federal Housing Finance Board for a temporary suspension of such payments.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Financial instability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the financial instability of a Bank, the Federal Housing Finance Board shall consider such factors as (i) whether the Bank's earnings are severely depressed, (ii) whether there has been a substantial decline in membership capital, and (iii) whether there has been a substantial reduction in advances outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall review the application and any supporting financial data and issue a written decision approving or disapproving such application. The Board's decision shall be accompanied by specific findings and reasons for its action.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitations on grounds for suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall not suspend payments to the Affordable Housing Program if the Bank's reduction in earnings is a result of (i) a change in the terms for advances to members which is not justified by market conditions, (ii) inordinate operating and administrative expenses, or (iii) mismanagement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Congressional notification and action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Federal Housing Finance Board shall notify the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate not less than 60 days before such suspension takes effect. Such suspension shall become effective unless a joint resolution is enacted disapproving such suspension.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Failure to use amounts for affordable housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any Bank fails to utilize or commit the full amount provided in this subsection in any year, 90 percent of the amount that has not been utilized or committed in that year shall be deposited by the Bank in an Affordable Housing Reserve Fund administered by the Board. The 10 percent of the unutilized and uncommitted amount retained by a Bank should be fully utilized or committed by that Bank during the following year and any remaining portion must be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. Under regulations established by the Board, funds from the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund may be made available to any Bank to meet additional affordable housing needs in such Bank's district pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Net earnings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The net earnings of any Federal Home Loan Bank shall be determined for purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) before declaring any dividend under section 1436 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that a preponderance of assistance provided under this subsection is ultimately received by low- and moderate-income households;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) ensure that subsidies provided by Banks to member institutions under this program are passed on to the ultimate borrower;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) establish uniform standards for subsidized advances under this program and subsidized lending by member institutions supported by such advances, including maximum subsidy and risk limitations for different categories of loans made under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) coordinate activities under this subsection with other Federal or federally-subsidized affordable housing activities to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Other programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No provision of this subsection or subsection (i) of this section shall preclude any Bank from establishing additional community investment cash advance programs or contributing additional sums to the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Advisory Council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Bank shall appoint an Advisory Council of 7 to 15 persons drawn from community and nonprofit organizations actively involved in providing or promoting low- and moderate-<!-- PDFPage:273 -->income housing in its district.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Comptroller General of the United States shall audit and evaluate the Affordable Housing Program established by this subsection after such program has been operating for 2 years. The Comptroller General shall report to Congress on the conclusions of the audit and recommend improvements or modifications to the program.</p>

Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and shall bear such rate of interest as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield for the month preceding the month of such purchase on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority provided in this subsection may be exercised during any calendar quarter beginning after October 28, 1974, only if the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairperson of the Board certify to the Congress that (1) alternative means cannot be effectively employed to permit members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System to continue to supply reasonable amounts of funds to the mortgage market, and (2) the ability to supply such funds is substantially impaired because of monetary stringency and a high level of interest rates. Any funds borrowed under this subsection shall be repaid by the Home Loan Banks at the earliest practicable date.</p>
