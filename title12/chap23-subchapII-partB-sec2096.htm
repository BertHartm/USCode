<p class="statutory-body">Each Farm Credit Bank may enter into agreements with Federal land bank associations in its district for sharing the gain or losses on loans or on security held therefor or acquired in liquidation thereof, and associations are authorized to enter into any such agreements and also, subject to bank approval, agreements with other associations in the district for sharing the risk of loss on loans endorsed by each such association. As may be authorized by the bank in accordance with regulations of the Farm Credit Administration, associations also may enter into agreements with other Farm Credit System institutions to share loan and other losses, whether to protect against capital impairment or for any other purpose.</p>
