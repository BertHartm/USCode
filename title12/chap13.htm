<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds (A) that the lack of an authoritative national source to make findings and to advise both the public and private sectors of the economy with respect to the use of building science and technology in achieving nationally acceptable standards and other technical provision for use in Federal, State, and local housing and building regulations is an obstacle to efforts by and imposes severe burdens upon all those who procure, design, construct, use, operate, maintain, and retire physical facilities, and frequently results in the failure to take full advantage of new and useful developments in technology which could improve our living environment; (B) that the establishment of model buildings codes or of a single national building code will not completely resolve the problem because of the difficulty at all levels of government in updating their housing and building regulations to reflect new developments in technology, as well as the irregularities and inconsistencies which arise in applying such requirements to particular localities or special local conditions; (C) that the lack of uniform housing and building regulatory provisions increases the costs of construction and thereby reduces the amount of housing and other community facilities which can be provided; and (D) that the existence of a single authoritative nationally recognized institution to provide for the evaluation of new technology could facilitate introduction of such innovations and their acceptance at the Federal, State, and local levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress further finds, however, that while an authoritative source of technical findings is needed, various private organizations and institutions, private industry, labor, and Federal and other governmental agencies and entities are presently engaged in building research, technology development, testing, and evaluation, standards and model code development and promulgation, and information dissemination. These existing activities should be encouraged and these capabilities effectively utilized wherever possible and appropriate to the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress declares that an authoritative nongovernmental instrument needs to be created to address the problems and issues described in paragraph (1), that the creation of such an instrument should be initiated by the Government, with the advice and assistance of the National Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Engineering-National Research Council (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Academies-Research Council&rdquo;) and of the various sectors of the building community, including labor and management, technical experts in building science and technology, and the various levels of government.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1701q. Supportive housing for the elderly</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to enable elderly persons to live with dignity and independence by expanding the supply of supportive housing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is designed to accommodate the special needs of elderly persons; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides a range of services that are tailored to the needs of elderly persons occupying such housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly. Such assistance shall be provided as (1) capital advances in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section, and (2) contracts for project rental assistance in accordance with subsection (c)(2) of this section. Such assistance may be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of a structure or a portion of a structure, or the acquisition of a structure from the Resolution Trust Corporation, to be used as supportive housing for the elderly in accordance with this section. Assistance may also cover the cost of real property acquisition, site improvement, conversion, demolition, relocation, and other expenses that the Secretary determines are necessary to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forms of assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Capital advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A capital advance provided under this section shall bear no interest and its repayment shall not be required so long as the housing remains available for very low-income elderly persons in accordance with this section. Such advance shall be in an amount calculated in accordance with the development cost limitation established in subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Project rental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Contracts for project rental assistance shall obligate the Secretary to make monthly payments to cover any part of the costs attributed to units occupied (or, as approved by the Secretary, held for occupancy) by very low-income elderly persons that is not met from project income. The annual contract amount for any project shall not exceed the sum of the initial annual project rentals for all units so occupied and any initial utility allowances for such units, as approved by the Secretary. Any contract amounts not used by a project in any year shall remain available to the project until the expiration of the contract. The Secretary may adjust the annual contract amount if the sum of the project income and the amount of assistance payments available under this paragraph are inadequate to provide for reasonable project costs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Tenant rent contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A very low-income person shall pay as rent for a dwelling unit assisted under this section the highest of the following amounts, rounded <!-- PDFPage:455 -->to the nearest dollar: (A) 30 percent of the person's adjusted monthly income, (B) 10 percent of the person's monthly income, or (C) if the person is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the person's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Term of commitment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All units in housing assisted under this section shall be made available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for not less than 40 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contract terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The initial term of a contract entered into under subsection (c)(2) of this section shall be 240 months. The Secretary shall, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, extend any expiring contract for a term of not less than 60 months. In order to facilitate the orderly extension of expiring contracts, the Secretary is authorized to make commitments to extend expiring contracts during the year prior to the date of expiration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds made available under this section shall be allocated by the Secretary among approvable applications submitted by private nonprofit organizations. Applications for assistance under this section shall be submitted by an applicant in such form and in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary shall establish. Such applications shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a description of the proposed housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of the assistance the applicant seeks under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a description of the resources that are expected to be made available in compliance with subsection (h) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of (A) the category or categories of elderly persons the housing is intended to serve; (B) the supportive services, if any, to be provided to the persons occupying such housing; (C) the manner in which such services will be provided to such persons, including, in the case of frail elderly persons, evidence of such residential supervision as the Secretary determines is necessary to facilitate the adequate provision of such services; and (D) the public or private sources of assistance that can reasonably be expected to fund or provide such services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a certification from the public official responsible for submitting a housing strategy for the jurisdiction to be served in accordance with section 12705 of title 42 that the proposed project is consistent with the approved housing strategy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such other information or certifications that the Secretary determines to be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall not reject an application on technical grounds without giving notice of that rejection and the basis therefor to the applicant and affording the applicant an opportunity to respond.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Selection criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish selection criteria for assistance under this section, which shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ability of the applicant to develop and operate the proposed housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the need for supportive housing for the elderly in the area to be served, taking into consideration the availability of public housing for the elderly and vacancy rates in such facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which the proposed size and unit mix of the housing will enable the applicant to manage and operate the housing efficiently and ensure that the provision of supportive services will be accomplished in an economical fashion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent to which the proposed design of the housing will meet the special physical needs of elderly persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the extent to which the applicant has demonstrated that the supportive services identified in subsection (e)(4) of this section will be provided on a consistent, long-term basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the extent to which the proposed design of the housing will accommodate the provision of supportive services that are expected to be needed, either initially or over the useful life of the housing, by the category or categories of elderly persons the housing is intended to serve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure that funds made available under this section are used effectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Provisions of services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall ensure that housing assisted under this section provides a range of services tailored to the needs of the category or categories of elderly persons (including frail elderly persons) occupying such housing. Such services may include (A) meal service adequate to meet nutritional need; (B) housekeeping aid; (C) personal assistance; (D) transportation services; (E) health-related services; and (F) such other services as the Secretary deems essential for maintaining independent living. The Secretary may permit the provision of services to elderly persons who are not residents if the participation of such persons will not adversely affect the cost-effectiveness or operation of the program or add significantly to the need for assistance under this Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Local coordination of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall ensure that owners have the managerial capacity to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assess on an ongoing basis the service needs of residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) coordinate the provision of supportive services and tailor such services to the individual needs of residents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) seek on a continuous basis new sources of assistance to ensure the long-term provision of supportive services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:456 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any cost associated with this subsection shall be an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Service coordinators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any cost associated with employing or otherwise retaining a service coordinator in housing assisted under this section shall be considered an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2) of this section. If a project is receiving congregate housing services assistance under section 8011 of title 42, the amount of costs provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section for the project service coordinator may not exceed the additional amount necessary to cover the costs of providing for the coordination of services for residents of the project who are not eligible residents under such section 8011 of title 42. To the extent that amounts are available pursuant to subsection (c)(2) of this section for the costs of carrying out this paragraph within a project, an owner of housing assisted under this section shall provide a service coordinator for the housing to coordinate the provision of services under this subsection within the housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Development cost limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall periodically establish development cost limitations by market area for various types and sizes of supportive housing for the elderly by publishing a notice of the cost limitations in the Federal Register. The cost limitations shall reflect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost of construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of supportive housing for the elderly that meets applicable State and local housing and building codes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the cost of movables necessary to the basic operation of the housing, as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the cost of special design features necessary to make the housing accessible to elderly persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the cost of special design features necessary to make individual dwelling units meet the physical needs of elderly project residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the cost of congregate space necessary to accommodate the provision of supportive services to elderly project residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) if the housing is newly constructed, the cost of meeting the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of title 42; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the cost of land, including necessary site improvement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In establishing development cost limitations for a given market area under this subsection, the Secretary shall use data that reflect currently prevailing costs of construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation, and land acquisition in the area. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;congregate space&rdquo; shall include space for cafeterias or dining halls, community rooms or buildings, workshops, adult day health facilities, or other outpatient health facilities, or other essential service facilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) RTC properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of existing housing and related facilities to be acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c) of this title or from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 1831q of this title, the cost limitations shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost of acquiring such housing,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the cost of rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, or improvement, including the moderate rehabilitation thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the cost of the land on which the housing and related facilities are located.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall adjust the cost limitation not less than once annually to reflect changes in the general level of construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation costs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Incentives for savings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Special housing account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall use the development cost limitations established under paragraph (1) or (2) to calculate the amount of financing to be made available to individual owners. Owners which incur actual development costs that are less than the amount of financing shall be entitled to retain 50 percent of the savings in a special housing account. Such percentage shall be increased to 75 percent for owners which add energy efficiency features which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) exceed the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of title 42;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) substantially reduce the life-cycle cost of the housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) reduce gross rent requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) enhance tenant comfort and convenience.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Uses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The special housing account established under subparagraph (A) may be used (i) to supplement services provided to residents of the housing or funds set aside for replacement reserves, or (ii) for such other purposes as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Design flexibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, give owners the flexibility to design housing appropriate to their location and proposed resident population within broadly defined parameters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Use of funds from other sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An owner shall be permitted voluntarily to provide funds from non-Federal sources for amenities and other features of appropriate design and construction suitable for supportive housing for the elderly if the cost of such amenities is (A) not financed with the advance, and (B) is not taken into account in determining the amount of Federal assistance or of the rent contribution of tenants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Tenant selection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An owner shall adopt written tenant selection procedures that are satisfactory to the <!-- PDFPage:457 -->Secretary as (A) consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income elderly persons; and (B) reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the lease. Such tenant selection procedures shall comply with subtitle C of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13601 et seq.] and any regulations issued under such subtitle. Owners shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Information regarding housing under this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide to an appropriate agency in each area (which may be the applicable Area Agency on the Aging) information regarding the availability of housing assisted under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Miscellaneous provisions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each owner shall certify, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that assistance made available under this section will be conducted and administered in conformity with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.], the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.], and other Federal, State, and local laws prohibiting discrimination and promoting equal opportunity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Owner deposit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall require an owner to deposit an amount not to exceed $25,000 in a special escrow account to assure the owner's commitment to the housing.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reduction of requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may reduce or waive the owner deposit specified under paragraph (1) for individual applicants if the Secretary finds that such waiver or reduction is necessary to achieve the purposes of this section and the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has the capacity to manage and maintain the housing in accordance with this section. The Secretary shall reduce or waive the requirement of the owner deposit under paragraph (1) in the case of a nonprofit applicant that is not affiliated with a national sponsor, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice of appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall notify an owner not less than 30 days prior to canceling any reservation of assistance provided under this section.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) the development of housing for nonelderly handicapped families under such programs is often more expensive than necessary, thereby reducing the number of such families that can be assisted with available funds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) the program under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 can continue to provide direct loans to finance group residences and independent apartments for nonelderly handicapped families, but can be made more efficient and less costly by the adoption of standards and procedures applicable only to housing for such families;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(G) the use of the program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to assist rentals for housing for nonelderly handicapped families should be replaced by a more appropriate subsidy mechanism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(H) both elderly and handicapped housing projects assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 will benefit from an increased emphasis on supportive services and a greater use of State and local funds; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1701r. Congressional findings respecting housing for senior citizens</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that there is a large and growing need for suitable housing for older people both in urban and rural areas. Our older citizens face special problems in meeting their housing needs because of the prevalence of modest and limited incomes among the elderly, their difficulty in obtaining liberal long-term home mortgage credit, and their need for housing planned and designed to include features necessary to the safety and convenience of the occupants in a suitable neighborhood environment. The Congress further finds that the present programs for housing the elderly under the Department of Housing and Urban Development have proven the value of Federal credit assistance in this field and at the same time demonstrated the urgent need for an expanded and more comprehensive effort to meet our responsibilities to our senior citizens.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; maximum term; maximum aggregate amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) is authorized to make, and contract to make, annual payments to a &ldquo;housing owner&rdquo; on behalf of &ldquo;qualified tenants&rdquo;, as those terms are defined herein, in such amounts and under such circumstances as are prescribed in or pursuant to this section. In no case shall a contract provide for such payments with respect to any housing for a period exceeding forty years. The aggregate amount of the contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $150,000,000 per annum prior to July 1, 1969, which maximum dollar amount shall be increased by $40,000,000, on July 1, 1969, by $100,000,000 on July 1, 1970, and by $40,000,000 on July 1, 1971.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Housing owner&rdquo; defined; limitation on payments to housing owner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;housing owner&rdquo; means a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit legal entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend legal entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is a mortgagor under section 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3)] and which, after August 10, 1965, has been approved for mortgage insurance thereunder and has been approved for receiving the benefits of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That, except as provided in subsection (j) of this section, no payments under this section may be made with respect to any property financed with a mortgage receiving the benefits of the interest rate provided for in the proviso in section 221(d)(5) of that Act [12 U.S.C. 1715<em>l</em>(d)(5)]. Such term also includes a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit legal entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend legal entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is the owner of a rental or cooperative housing project financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatement and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. Subject to the limitations provided in subsection (j) of this section, the term &ldquo;housing owner&rdquo; also has the meaning prescribed in such subsection. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing payments to a housing owner with respect to projects in which all or part of the dwelling units do not contain kitchen facilities; but of the total amount of contracts to make annual payments approved in appropriation Acts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section after December 31, 1970, not more than 10 per centum in the aggregate shall be made with respect to such projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;qualified tenant&rdquo; means any individual or family having an income which would qualify such individual or family for assistance under section 1437f of title 42, except that such term shall also include any individual or family who was receiving assistance under this section on the day preceding December 21, 1979, so long as such individual or family continues to meet the conditions for such assistance which were in effect on such day; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;income&rdquo; means income from all sources of each member of the household, as determined in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary. In determining amounts to be excluded from income, the Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, take into account the number of minor children in the household and such other factors as the Secretary may determine are appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The terms &ldquo;qualified tenant&rdquo; and &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; include a member of a cooperative who satisfies <!-- PDFPage:468 -->the foregoing requirements and who, upon resale of his membership to the cooperative, will not be reimbursed for any equity increment accumulated through payments under this section. With respect to members of a cooperative, the terms &ldquo;rental&rdquo; and &ldquo;rental charges&rdquo; mean the charges under the occupancy agreements between such members and the cooperative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Annual payment amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the annual payment with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the lesser of (1) 70 per centum of the fair market rent, or (2) the amount by which the fair market rental for such unit exceeds 30 per centum of the tenant's adjusted income.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may enter into agreements, or authorize housing owners to enter into agreements, with public or private agencies for services required in the selection of qualified tenants, including those who may be approved, on the basis of the probability of future increases in their incomes, as lessees under an option to purchase (which will give such approved qualified tenants an exclusive right to purchase at a price established or determined as provided in the option) dwellings, and in the establishment of rentals. The Secretary is authorized (without limiting his authority under any other provision of law) to delegate to any such public or private agency his authority to issue certificates pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No payments under this section may be made with respect to any property for which the costs of operation (including wages and salaries) are determined by the Secretary to be greater than similar costs of operation of similar housing in the community where the property is situated.</p>

To ensure that qualified tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this section immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under this section, the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into with owners of projects assisted under this section but not subject to mortgages insured under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.] to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of qualified tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under section 1437c(c) of title 42. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress affirms the national goal, as set forth in section 1441 of title 42, of &ldquo;a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that this goal has not been fully realized for many of the Nation's lower income families; that this is a matter of grave national concern; and that there exist in the public and private sectors of the economy the resources and capabilities necessary to the full realization of this goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that in the administration of those housing programs authorized by this Act which are designed to assist families with incomes so low that they could not otherwise decently house themselves, and of other Government programs designed to assist in the provision of housing for such families, the highest priority and emphasis should be given to meeting the housing needs of those families for which the national goal has not become a reality; and in the carrying out of such programs there should be the fullest practicable utilization of the resources and capabilities of private enterprise and of individual self-help techniques.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that Federal aids to housing have not contributed fully to improvement in architectural standards. This objective has been contemplated in Federal housing legislation since the establishment of mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress commends the Department of Housing and Urban Development for its recent efforts to improve architectural standards through competitive design awards and in other ways but at the same time recognizes that this important objective requires high priority if Federal aid is to make its full communitywide contribution toward improving our urban environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that even within the necessary budget limitations on housing for low and moderate income families architectural design could be improved not only to make the housing more attractive, but to make it better suited to the needs of occupants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that in the administration of housing programs which assist in the provision of housing for low and moderate income families, emphasis should be given to encouraging good design as an essential component of such housing and to developing housing which will be of such quality as to reflect its important relationship to the architectural standards of the neighborhood and community in which it is situated, consistent with prudent budgeting.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) This section may be cited as the &lsquo;Public Housing Security Demonstration Act of 1978&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b)(1) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) low-income and elderly public housing residents of the Nation have suffered substantially from rising crime and violence, and are being threatened as a result of inadequate security arrangements for the prevention of physical violence, theft, burglary, and other crimes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) older persons generally regard the fear of crime as the most serious problem in their lives, to the extent that one-fourth of all Americans over 65 voluntarily restrict their mobility because of it;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) crime and the fear of crime have led some residents to move from public housing projects;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) an integral part of successfully providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for low-income persons is to insure that the housing is secure;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(E) local public housing authorities may have inadequate security arrangements for the prevention of crime and vandalism; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(F) action is needed to provide for the security of public housing residents and to preserve the Nation's investment in its public housing stock.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) It is, therefore, declared to be the policy of the United States to provide for a demonstration and evaluation of effective means of mitigating crime and vandalism in public housing projects, in order to provide a safe living environment for the residents, particularly the elderly residents, of such projects.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c)(1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall promptly initiate and carry out during the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1978, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, a program for the development, demonstration, and evaluation of improved, innovative community anticrime and security methods, concepts and techniques which will mitigate the level of crime in public housing projects and their surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) In selecting public housing projects to receive assistance under this section, the Secretary shall assure that a broad spectrum of project types, locations and tenant populations are represented and shall consider at least the following: the extent of crime and vandalism currently existing in the projects; the extent, nature and quality of community anticrime efforts in the projects and surrounding areas; the extent, nature and quality of police and other protective services available to the projects and their tenants; the demand for public housing units in the locality, the vacancy rate, and extent of abandonment of such units; and the characteristics and needs of the public housing tenants.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) In selecting the anticrime and security methods, concepts and techniques to be demonstrated under this section, the Secretary shall consider the improvement of physical security equipment or dwelling units in those projects, social and environmental design improvements, tenant awareness and volunteer programs, tenant participation and employment in providing security services, and such other measures as deemed necessary or appropriate by the Secretary. Particular attention shall be given to comprehensive community anticrime and security plans submitted by public housing authorities which (i) provide for coordination between public housing management and local law enforcement officials, or (ii) coordinate resources available to the community through programs funded by the <!-- PDFPage:493 -->Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the Community Services Administration, and the Corporation for National and Community Service, or other Federal or State agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(4) In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall coordinate and jointly target resources with other agencies, particularly the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Community Services Administration, and State and local agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(5) In order to assess the impact of crime and vandalism in public housing projects, the Secretary may, as part of the Annual Housing Survey conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development or by other means, collect data on crime and vandalism and integrate the data collection with the victimization surveys undertaken by the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(6) The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize information derived from the program authorized by this section for assisting in establishing (A) guidelines to be used by public housing authorities in determining strategies to meet the security needs of tenants of public housing projects assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] other than under section 8 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1437f], and (B) guidelines for improvements relating to the security of projects (and the tenants living in such projects) assisted under section 14 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1437<em>l</em>].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) The Secretary shall initiate and carry out a survey of crime and vandalism existing in the Nation's public housing projects. The survey shall include the nature, extent and impact of crime and vandalism and the nature and extent of resources currently available and employed to alleviate crime and vandalism in public housing.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) The Secretary shall report to the Congress not later than eighteen months after the date of enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 [Oct. 8, 1980]. Such report shall include the results of the survey on crime and vandalism in public housing; findings from the demonstration and evaluation of various methods of reducing the level of crime; and legislative recommendations, if appropriate for (A) a comprehensive program to increase security in public housing projects and (B) increasing the coordination between anticrime programs of other State and Federal agencies that may be used by public housing authorities. Any recommendations shall include estimated costs of such programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) Of the additional authority approved in appropriation Acts with respect to entering into annual contributions contracts under section 5(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437c(c)] for the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1978, the Secretary may utilize up to $12,000,000 of such authority in the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1978, for the establishment of the public housing security demonstration program authorized by this section. Of the authority approved in appropriation Acts for the purpose of entering into annual contributions contracts under section 5(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1980, the Secretary may enter into contracts to carry out this section, except that the aggregate amount obligated over the duration of such contracts may not exceed $10,000,000.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized and empowered upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure banks, trust companies, personal finance companies, mortgage companies, building and loan associations, installment lending companies and other such financial institutions, which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience or facilities and approves as eligible for credit insurance, against losses which they may sustain as a result of loans and advances of credit, and purchases of obligations representing loans and advances of credit, made by them on and after July 1, 1939, for the purpose of (i) financing alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures or manufactured homes, and the building of new structures, upon urban, suburban, or rural real property (including the restoration, rehabilitation, rebuilding, and replacement of such improvements which have been damaged or destroyed by earthquake, conflagration, tornado, hurricane, cyclone, flood, or other catastrophe), by the owners thereof or by lessees of such real property under a lease expiring not less than six months after the maturity of the loan or advance of credit; and for the purpose of (ii) financing the purchase of a manufactured home to be used by the owner as his principal residence or financing the purchase of a lot on which to place such home and paying expenses reasonably necessary for the appropriate preparation of such lot, including the installation of utility connections, sanitary facilities, and paving, and the construction of a suitable pad, or financing only the acquisition of such a lot either with or without such preparation by an owner of a manufactured home; and for the purpose of financing the preservation of historic structures, and, as used in this section, the term &ldquo;historic structures&rdquo; means residential structures which are registered in the National Register of Historic Places or which are certified by the Secretary of the Interior to conform to National Register criteria; and the term &ldquo;preservation&rdquo; means restoration or rehabilitation undertaken for such purposes as are approved by the Secretary in regulations issued by him, after consulting with the Secretary of the Interior. In no case shall the insurance granted by the Secretary under this section to any such financial institution on loans, advances of credit, and purchases made by such financial institution for such purposes on and after July 1, 1939, exceed 10 per centum of the total amount of such loans, advances of credit, and purchases: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to any loan, advance of credit, or purchase made after August 2, 1954, the amount of any claim for loss on any such individual loan, advance of credit or purchase paid by the Secretary under the provisions of this section to a lending institution shall not exceed 90 per centum of such loss.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">After August 2, 1954, (i) the Secretary shall not enter into contracts for insurance pursuant to this section except with lending institutions which are subject to the inspection and supervision of a governmental agency required by law to make periodic examinations of their books and accounts, and which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience or facilities to make and service such loans, advances or purchases, and with such other lending institutions which the Secretary approves as eligible for insurance pursuant to this section on the basis of their credit and their experience or facilities to make and service such loans, advances or purchases; (ii) only such items as substantially protect or improve the basic livability or utility of properties shall be eligible for financing under this section, and therefore the Secretary shall from time to time declare ineligible for financing under this section any item, product, alteration, repair, improvement, or class thereof which he determines would not substantially protect or improve the basic livability or utility of such properties, and he may also declare ineligible for financing under this section any item which he determines is especially subject to selling abuses; and (iii) the Secretary is authorized and directed, by such regulations or procedures as he shall deem advisable, to prevent the use of any financial assistance under this section (1) with respect to new residential structures (other than manufactured homes) that have not been completed and occupied for at least six months, or (2) which would, through multiple loans, result in an outstanding aggregate loan balance with respect to the same structure exceeding the dollar amount limitation prescribed in this subsection for the type of loan involved: <em>Provided</em>, That this clause (iii) may in the discretion of the Secretary be waived with respect to the period of occupancy or completion of any such new residential structures. The Secretary is hereby authorized and directed, with respect to manufactured homes to be financed under this section, to (i) prescribe minimum property standards to assure the livability and durability of the manufactured home and the suitability of the site on which the manufactured home is to be located; and (ii) obtain assurances from the borrower that the manufactured home will be placed on a site which complies with the standards prescribed by the Secretary and with local zoning and other applicable local requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The insurance authority provided under this section may be made available with respect to any existing manufactured home that has not been insured under this section if such home was constructed in accordance with the standards issued under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5401 et seq.] and it meets standards similar to the minimum property standards applicable to existing homes insured under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary shall fix a premium charge for the insurance hereafter granted under this section, but in the case of any obligation representing any loan, advance of credit, or purchase, such premium charge shall not exceed an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the net proceeds of such loan, advance of credit, or purchase, for the term of such obligation, and such premium charge shall be payable in advance by the financial institution and shall be paid at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1706c. Insurance of mortgages</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Supplemental system; limitation on amount; termination of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To assist in providing adequate housing for families of low and moderate income, particularly in suburban and outlying areas, this section is designed to supplement systems of mortgage insurance under other provisions of this chapter by making feasible the insurance of mortgages covering properties in areas where it is not practicable to obtain conformity with many of the requirements essential to the insurance of mortgages on housing in built-up urban areas. The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure, as hereinafter provided, any mortgage (as defined in section 1707 of this title) offered to him which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <em>Provided</em>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this section and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $100,000,000, except that with the approval of the President such aggregate amount may be increased at any time or times by additional amounts aggregating not more than $150,000,000 upon a determination by the President, taking into account the general effect of any such increase upon conditions in the building industry and upon the national economy, that such increase is in the public interest: <em>And provided further</em>, That no mortgage shall be insured under this section after August 2, 1954, except pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:517 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed $5,700, and not to exceed 95 per centum of the appraised value, as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, of a property upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for a single-family residence, and which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagor shall be the owner and occupant of the property at the time of insurance and shall have paid on account of the property at least 5 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of acquisition in cash or its equivalent, or shall be the builder constructing the dwelling, in which case the principal obligation shall not exceed 85 per centum of the appraised value of the property or $5,100: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing for families of low and moderate income particularly in suburban and outlying areas: <em>And provided further</em>, That, where the mortgagor is the owner and occupant of the property and establishes (to the satisfaction of the Secretary) that his home, which he occupied as an owner or as a tenant, was destroyed or damaged to such an extent that reconstruction is required as a result of a flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm or other catastrophe, which the President, pursuant to sections 5122(2) and 5170 of title 42, has determined to be a major disaster, such maximum dollar limitation may be increased by the Secretary from $5,700 to $7,000, and the percentage limitation may be increased by the Secretary from 95 per centum to 100 per centum of the appraised value;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed thirty years from the date of insurance of the mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary requiring periodic payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance and service charges, if any) at not to exceed 5 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as hereinafter provided and to the service charge, if any) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, service charges, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, and other matters as the the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this section, but in the case of any mortgage, such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this section at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this section, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this section is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized, in his discretion, to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Release of mortgagor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, at any time under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary under this section shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rights of mortgagee upon foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under this section shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property in accordance with the regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Secretary or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such <!-- PDFPage:518 -->property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in section 1710(a) of this title with respect to mortgages insured under section 203(b)(2)(D) of this Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applicability of other sections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (j), and (k) of section 1710 of this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section except that all references therein to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Funds or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and all references therein to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section: <em>Provided</em>, That debentures issued in connection with mortgages insured under this section shall have the same tax exemption as debentures issued in connection with mortgages insured under section 1709 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure as hereinafter provided any mortgage offered to him which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance; mortgage limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a 1-family residence, 95 percent of the median 1-family house price in the area, as determined by the Secretary; in the case of a 2-family residence, 107 percent of such median price; in the case of a 3-family residence, 130 percent of such median price; or in the case of a 4-family residence, 150 percent of such median price; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 75 percent of the dollar amount limitation determined under section 1454(a)(2) of this title for a residence of the applicable size;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">except that the applicable dollar amount limitation in effect for any area under this subparagraph may not be less than the greater of the dollar amount limitation in effect under this section for the area on September 28, 1994,<sup><a href="#1709_1_target" name="1709_1">1</a></sup> or 38 percent of the dollar amount limitation determined under section 1454(a)(2) of this title for a residence of the applicable size; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (2), not to exceed an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 97 percent of $25,000 of the appraised value of the property, as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 95 percent of such value in excess of $25,000 but not in excess of $125,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) 90 percent of such value in excess of $125,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;area&rdquo; means a county, or a metropolitan statistical area as established by the Office of Management and Budget, whichever results in the higher dollar amount. If the mortgage to be insured under this section covers property on which there is located a one- to four-family residence, and the appraised value of the property, as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, does not exceed $50,000, the principal obligation may be in an amount not to exceed 97 percent of such appraised value. If the mortgagor is a veteran, and the mortgage to be insured under this section covers property upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for a one-family residence, the principal obligation may be in an amount equal to the sum of (i) 100 per centum of $25,000 of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, and (ii) 95 per centum of such value in excess of $25,000. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in any case where the dwelling is not approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction, such mortgage shall not exceed 90 per centum of the entire appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, unless (i) the dwelling was completed more than one year prior to the application for mortgage insurance, or (ii) the dwelling was approved for guaranty, insurance, or a direct loan under chapter 37 of title 38 prior to the beginning of construction, or (iii) the dwelling is covered by a consumer protection or warranty plan acceptable to the Secretary and satisfies all requirements which would have been applicable if such dwelling had been approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction. As used herein, the term &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; means any person who served on active duty in the armed forces of the United States for a period of not less than ninety days (or is certified by the Secretary of Defense as having performed extra-hazardous service), and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable, except that persons enlisting in the armed forces after September 7, 1980, or entering active duty after October 16, 1981, shall have their eligibility determined in accordance with section 5303A(d) of title 38. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the residence due to the installation of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except with respect to mortgages executed by mortgagors who are veterans, a mortgage may not involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in excess of 98.75 percent of the appraised value of the property (97.75 percent, in the case of a mortgage with an appraised value in excess of $50,000), plus the amount of the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;appraised value&rdquo; means the amount set forth in the written statement required under section 1715q of this title, or a similar amount determined <!-- PDFPage:530 -->by the Secretary if section 1715q of this title does not apply. Notwithstanding the authority of the Secretary to establish the terms of insurance under this section and approve the initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees (and subject to any other limitations under this section on the amount of a principal obligation), the Secretary may not (by regulation or otherwise) limit the percentage or amount of any such approved charges and fees that may be included in the principal obligation of a mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the Secretary may not insure, or enter into a commitment to insure, a mortgage under this section that is executed by a first-time homebuyer and that involves a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in excess of 97 percent of the appraised value of the property unless the mortgagor has completed a program of counseling with respect to the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership that is approved by the Secretary; except that the Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, waive the applicability of this requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary, but not to exceed, in any event, thirty-five years (or thirty years if such mortgage is not approved for insurance prior to construction) from the date of the beginning of amortization of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary requiring periodic payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as hereinafter provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default, reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Be executed by a mortgagor who shall have paid on account of the property (except with respect to a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who is a veteran) at least 3 per centum, or such larger amount as the Secretary may determine, of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of acquisition (excluding the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured) in cash or its equivalent: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who is sixty years of age or older as of the date the mortgage is endorsed for insurance or with respect to a mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (i) of this section, or with respect to a mortgage covering a single-family home being purchased under the low-income housing demonstration project assisted pursuant to section 1436&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1709_2_target" name="1709_2">2</a></sup> of title 42, or with respect to a mortgage covering a housing unit in connection with a homeownership program under the Homeownership and Opportunity Through HOPE Act, the mortgagor's payment required by this subsection may be paid by a corporation or person other than the mortgagor under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe: <em>Provided further</em>, That for purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider as cash or its equivalent any amounts borrowed from a family member (as such term is defined in section 1707 of this title), subject only to the requirements that, in any case in which the repayment of such borrowed amounts is secured by a lien against the property, such lien shall be subordinate to the mortgage and the sum of the principal obligation of the mortgage and the obligation secured by such lien may not exceed 100 percent of the appraised value of the property plus any initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees in connection with the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) <cap-smallcap>Alaska and hawaii.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, with respect to a mortgage originated in the State of Alaska or the State of Hawaii and endorsed for insurance in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, involving a principal obligation not in excess of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) in the case of a mortgage for a property with an appraised value equal to or less than $50,000, 98.75 percent of the appraised value of the property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) in the case of a mortgage for a property with an appraised value in excess of $50,000 but not in excess of $125,000, 97.65 percent of the appraised value of the property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) in the case of a mortgage for a property with an appraised value in excess of $125,000, 97.15 percent of the appraised value of the property; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Average closing cost</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;average closing cost&rdquo; means, with respect to a State, the average, for mortgages executed for properties that are located within the State, of the <!-- PDFPage:531 -->total amounts (as determined by the Secretary) of initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees (as the Secretary shall approve) that are paid in connection with such mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to fix premium charges for the insurance of mortgages under the separate sections of this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall be not less than an amount equivalent to one-fourth of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments: <em>Provided</em>, That premium charges fixed for insurance (1) under section 1715z&ndash;10, 1715z&ndash;12, 1715z&ndash;16, 1715z&ndash;17, or 1715z&ndash;18 of this title, or any other financing mechanism providing alternative methods for repayment of a mortgage that is determined by the Secretary to involve additional risk, or (2) under subsections (n) and (k) of this section are not required to be the same as the premium charges for mortgages insured under the other provisions of this section, but in no case shall premium charges under subsection (n) or (k) of this section exceed 1 per centum per annum: <em>Provided</em>, That any reduced premium charge so fixed and computed may, in the discretion of the Secretary, also be made applicable in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe to each insured mortgage outstanding under the section or sections involved at the time the reduced premium charge is fixed. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That debentures presented in payment of premium charges shall represent obligations of the particular insurance fund or account to which such premium charges are to be credited: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this section, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this section unless the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is economically sound. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured under this section until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to mortgages (1) for which the Secretary requires, at the time the mortgage is insured, the payment of a single premium charge to cover the total premium obligation for the insurance of the mortgage, and (2) on which the principal obligation is paid before the number of years on which the premium with respect to a particular mortgage was based, or the property is sold subject to the mortgage or is sold and the mortgage is assumed prior to such time, the Secretary shall provide for refunds, where appropriate, of a portion of the premium paid and shall provide for appropriate allocation of the premium cost among the mortgagors over the term of the mortgage, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary which take into account sound financial and actuarial considerations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, each mortgage secured by a 1- to 4-family dwelling and executed on or after October 1, 1994, that is an obligation of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or of the General Insurance Fund pursuant to subsection (v)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1709_3_target" name="1709_3">3</a></sup> of this section, shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall establish and collect, at the time of insurance, a single premium payment in an amount not exceeding 2.25 percent of the amount of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage. In the case of a mortgage for which the mortgagor is a first-time homebuyer who completes a program of counseling with respect to the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership that is approved by the Secretary, the premium payment under this subparagraph shall not exceed 2.0 percent of the amount of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage. Upon payment in full of the principal obligation of a mortgage prior to the maturity date of the mortgage, the Secretary shall refund all of the unearned premium charges paid on the mortgage pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In addition to the premium under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall establish and collect annual premium payments in an amount not exceeding 0.50 percent of the remaining insured principal balance (excluding the portion of the remaining balance attributable to the premium collected under subparagraph (A) and without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments) for the following periods:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For any mortgage involving an original principal obligation (excluding any premium collected under subparagraph (A)) that is less than 90 percent of the appraised value of the property (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance), for the first 11 years of the mortgage term.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:532 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For any mortgage involving an original principal obligation (excluding any premium collected under subparagraph (A)) that is greater than or equal to 90 percent of such value, for the first 30 years of the mortgage term; except that notwithstanding the matter preceding clause (i), for any mortgage involving an original principal obligation (excluding any premium collected under subparagraph (A)) that is greater than 95 percent of such value, the annual premium collected during the 30-year period under this clause shall be in an amount not exceeding 0.55 percent of the remaining insured principal balance (excluding the portion of the remaining balance attributable to the premium collected under subparagraph (A) and without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Increase in maximum amount of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter governing maximum mortgage amounts for insuring a mortgage secured by a one- to four-family dwelling, the maximum amount of the mortgage determined under any such provision may be increased by the amount of the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contract of insurance as evidence of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan or mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved financial institution or approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved financial institution or approved mortgagee.</p>

In making this determination with respect to the occupancy of secondary residences, the Secretary may not insure mortgages with respect to such residences unless the Secretary determines that it is necessary to avoid undue hardship to the mortgagor. In no event may a secondary residence under this subsection include a vacation home, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conveyance, sale, and assignment by mortgagee; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure; direct conveyances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under section 1709 of this title shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by the Secretary, or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. The Secretary is also authorized, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, to make the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided available to the mortgagee, notwithstanding any provision of this section requiring conveyance of title to the property to the Secretary, (1)(A) upon sale of the insured property at foreclosure, where such sale is for at least the fair market value of the property (with appropriate adjustments), as determined by the Secretary, or (B) upon the sale of the insured property by the mortgagor after default, if (i) the sale has been approved by the Secretary, (ii) the mortgagee receives an amount at least equal to the fair market value of the property (with appropriate adjustments), as determined by the Secretary, and (iii) the mortgagor has received appropriate homeownership counseling, as determined by the Secretary; and (2) upon the assignment to the Secretary of all claims referred to in clause (2) of the preceding sentence. The payment of benefits under the preceding sentence may be made for any mortgage insured pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or after November 30, 1983 (on or after November 7, 1988, with respect to the payment of benefits under clause (1)(B) of the preceding sentence), and, with the approval of the mortgagee, for any mortgage insured pursuant to a commitment issued before that date. As a condition of the receipt of such benefits, the mortgagee shall maintain or assure the maintenance of the mortgaged property (in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulation provide) during the period beginning on the taking of the possession or other acquisition of the mortgaged property by the mortgagee and ending on conveyance to the Secretary or other disposition of the mortgaged property in accordance with this section, and funds expended by the mortgagee in meeting such obligation shall be included, to the extent provided in this subsection or in subsection (k) of this section, in debentures or other insurance payment pursuant to this section. Upon the conveyance and assignment referred to in the first sentence of this section or the sale and assignment referred to in the second sentence of this subsection, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee debentures having a par value equal to the value of the mortgage and (subject to subsection (e)(2) of this section) a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by

in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, but in no event in excess of $75: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to mortgages which are accepted for insurance under section 203(b)(2)(D) of this Act or under the second proviso of section 1713(c)(2) of this title, or under section 1715e of this title, or with respect to any mortgage accepted for insurance under section 1709 of this title on or after August 2, 1954, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary on account of the

further</em>, That with respect to a mortgage accepted for insurance pursuant to a commitment issued prior to September 2, 1964, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e) of this section), include in debentures or in the cash payment, in addition to amounts otherwise allowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 532 and 536 of the Appendix to title 50 apply, and which are insured under section 1709 of this title, and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter: <em>And provided further</em>, That where the claim is paid in cash there shall be included in the cash payment an amount equivalent to the compensation for loss of debenture interest that would be included in computing debentures if such claim were being paid in debentures: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to any mortgage covering a one-, two-, three-, or four-family residence insured under this chapter, if the Secretary

the mortgagee for an extension of the time for the curing of the default and of the time for commencing foreclosure proceedings or for otherwise acquiring title to the mortgaged property to such time as the Secretary may determine is necessary and desirable to enable the mortgagor to complete the mortgage payments, including an extension of time beyond the stated maturity of the mortgage, and in the event of a subsequent foreclosure or acquisition of the property by other means the Secretary is authorized to include in the debentures an amount equal to any unpaid mortgage interest, or (2) approve a modification of the terms of the mortgage for the purpose of changing the amortization provisions by recasting, over the remaining term of the mortgage or over such longer period as may be approved by the Secretary, the total unpaid amount then due, as determined by the Secretary, with the modification to become effective currently or to become effective upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of the period for curing the default; and the principal amount of the mortgage, as modified, shall be considered to be the &ldquo;original principal obligation of the mortgage&rdquo; as that term is used in this chapter for the purpose of computing the total face value of the debentures to be issued or the cash payment to be made by the Secretary to a mortgagee: <em>And provided further</em>, That, notwithstanding any requirement contained in this chapter that debentures may be issued only upon acquisition of title and possession by the mortgagee and its subsequent conveyance and transfer to the Secretary, and for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary conveyance expense in connection with payment of insurance benefits under the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized, subject to such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to permit the mortgagee to tender to the Secretary a satisfactory conveyance of title and transfer of possession direct from the mortgagor or other appropriate grantor and to pay the insurance benefits to the mortgagee which it would otherwise be entitled to if such conveyance had been made to the mortgagee and from the mortgagee to the Secretary: <em>And provided further</em>, That the Secretary may pay insurance benefits to the mortgagee to recompense the mortgagee for its actions to provide an alternative to the foreclosure of a mortgage that is in default, which actions may include special forebearance, loan modification, and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, all upon terms and conditions as the mortgagee shall determine in the mortgagee's sole discretion, within guidelines provided by the Secretary, but which may not include assignment of a mortgage to the Secretary: <em>And provided further</em>, That for purposes of <!-- PDFPage:549 -->the preceding proviso, no action authorized by the Secretary and no action taken, nor any failure to act, by the Secretary or the mortgagee shall

All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default: <em>Provided</em>, That debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715<em>o</em> of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages insured under section 1709 or section 1713 of this title prior to February 3, 1938 shall be subject only to such Federal, State, and local taxes as the mortgages in exchange for which they are issued would be subject to in the hands of the holder of the debentures and shall be a liability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, but such debentures shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; but any mortgagee entitled to receive any such debentures may elect to receive in lieu thereof a cash adjustment and debentures issued as hereinafter provided and bearing the current rate of interest. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by the mortgages insured after February 3, 1938, shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority; and such debentures shall be paid out of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certificate of claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, at the time of the conveyance to the Secretary of the property covered by the mortgage, the mortgagor had redeemed the property and paid in full all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded.

<!-- PDFPage:550 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be paid to the mortgagor of such property if the mortgage was insured under section 1709 of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That on and after September 2, 1964, any excess remaining after payment to the holder of the full amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest increment thereon, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund; and</p>

The Secretary shall, by regulation, carry out a program of sales of such properties and shall develop and implement appropriate credit terms and standards to be used in carrying out the program. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real or personal property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint: <em>And provided further</em>, That a conveyance or transfer of title to real or personal property or an interest therein to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, his successors and assigns, without identifying the Secretary therein, shall be deemed a proper conveyance or transfer to the same extent and of like effect as if the Secretary were personally named in such conveyance or transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Mortgagor's or mortgagee's interest in property or claim conveyed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgagee or mortgagor shall have, and no certificate of claim shall be construed to give to any mortgagee or mortgagor, any right or interest in any property conveyed to the Secretary or in any claim assigned to him; nor shall the Secretary owe any duty to any mortgagee or mortgagor with respect to the handling or disposal of any such property or the collection of any such claim.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;mortgagee&rdquo; means the original lender under a mortgage, and its successors and assigns, and includes the holders of credit instruments issued under a trust mortgage or deed of trust pursuant to which such holders act by and through a trustee therein named.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes the several States, and Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Federal or State instrumentalities, municipal corporate instrumentalities of one or more States, or limited dividend or redevelopment or housing corporations restricted by Federal or State laws or regulations of State banking or insurance departments as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, or methods of operation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any other mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, require any such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation so as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment. Any such regulations or restrictions shall continue for such period or periods as the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may require, including until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder, or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire, for not to exceed $100, such stock or interest in the mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulations or restrictions. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The insurance of mortgages under this section is intended to facilitate particularly the production of rental accommodations, at reasonable rents, of design and size suitable for family living. The Secretary is, therefore, authorized in the administration of this section to take action, by regulation or otherwise, which will direct the benefits of mortgage insurance hereunder primarily to those projects which make adequate provision for families with children, and in which every effort has been made to achieve moderate rental charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary may not insure any mortgage under this section (except a mortgage with respect to a manufactured home park designed exclusively for occupancy by elderly persons) unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for the property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certification to be filed with the Secretary. Violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for insurance; mortgage limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage on any property or project shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Repealed. Pub. L. 93&ndash;383, title III, &sect;304(a)(1), Aug. 22, 1974, 88 Stat. 677.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project (when the proposed improvements are completed): <em>Provided</em>, That this limitation shall not apply to mortgages on housing in Alaska or in Guam, but such a mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the value of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the land, the proposed physical improvements, utilities within the boundaries of the property or project, architect's fees, taxes, and interest accruing during construction, and other miscellaneous charges incident to construction and approved by the Secretary): <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing contained in this section shall preclude the insurance of mortgages covering existing construction located in slum or blighted areas, as defined in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section, and the Secretary may require such repair or rehabilitation work to be completed as is, in his discretion, necessary to remove conditions detrimental to safety, health, or morals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Not to exceed, for such part of the property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use (excluding exterior land improvements as defined by the Secretary), $30,420 per family unit without a bedroom, $33,696 per family unit with one bedroom, $40,248 per family unit with two bedrooms, $49,608 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $56,160 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, or not to exceed $9,000 per space; except that as to projects to consist of elevator type structures the Secretary may in his discretion, increase the dollar amount limitations per family unit to not to exceed $35,100 per family unit without a bedroom, $39,312 per family unit with one bedroom, $48,204 per family unit with two bedrooms, $60,372 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $68,262 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, as the case may be, to com<!-- PDFPage:558 -->pensate for the higher costs incident to the construction of elevator-type structures of sound standards of construction and design; and except that the Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the foregoing dollar amount limitations contained in this paragraph by not to exceed 110 percent in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require and by not to exceed 140 percent where the Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis, but in no case may any such increase exceed 90 percent where the Secretary determines that a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association in implementing its special assistance functions under section 1720&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> of this title (as such section existed immediately before November 30, 1983) is involved. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments (unless otherwise approved by the Secretary) within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release. No mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this section or section 1715a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> of this title unless the Secretary finds that the property or project, with respect to which the mortgage is executed, is economically sound. Such property or project may include five or more family units and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Premium, appraisal, and inspection charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall collect a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this section which shall be payable annually in advance by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under any subchapter and section of this chapter, except debentures of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, or of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund at par plus accrued interest. In addition to the premium charge herein provided for the Secretary is authorized to charge and collect such amounts as he may deem reasonable for the appraisal of a property or project offered for insurance and for the inspection of such property or project during construction: <em>Provided</em>, That such charges for appraisal and inspection shall not aggregate more than 1 per centum of the original principal face amount of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjusted premium charge on payment of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this section is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until such maturity date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Repealed. Pub. L. 89&ndash;117, title XI, &sect;1108(e)(3), Aug. 10, 1965, 79 Stat. 504</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment of insurance after default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this section shall be considered a default under such mortgage and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loans not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transactions. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (h) of this section, and debentures having a par value equal to the original principal face amount of the mortgage plus such amount as the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default, less the sum of (i) that part of the amount of the principal obligation that has been repaid by the mortgagor, (ii) an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the unpaid amount of such principal obligation, and (iii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagee in the event of a default under the mort<!-- PDFPage:559 -->gage may, at its option and in accordance with regulations of, and in a period to be determined by, the Secretary, proceed to foreclose on and obtain possession of or otherwise acquire such property from the mortgagor after default, and receive the benefits of the insurance as herein provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims that may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in this subsection, except that in such event the 1 per centum deduction, set out in (ii) hereof, shall not apply. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon receipt, after September 2, 1964, of an application for insurance benefits on a mortgage insured under this chapter, the Secretary may terminate the mortgagee's obligation to pay premium charges on the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Certificate of claim; division of excess proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued under this section shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, on the date of the assignment, transfer and delivery to the Secretary provided for in subsection (g) of this section, the mortgagor had extinguished the mortgage indebtedness by payment in full of all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. If the net amount realized from the mortgage, and all claims in connection therewith, so assigned, transferred, and delivered, and from the property covered by such mortgage and all claims in connection with such property, after deducting all expenses incurred by the Secretary in handling, dealing with, acquiring title to, and disposing of such mortgage and property and in collecting such claims, exceeds the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development finds that, because of higher costs prevailing in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands, it is not feasible to construct dwellings or manufactured home courts or parks on prop<!-- PDFPage:568 -->erty located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, or livability, within the limitations as to maximum or maxima mortgage amounts provided in this chapter, the Secretary may, by regulations or otherwise, prescribe, with respect to dollar amount, a higher maximum or maxima for the principal obligation of mortgages insured under this chapter covering property located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands in such amounts as he shall find necessary to compensate for such higher costs but not to exceed, in any event, the maximum or maxima otherwise applicable (including increased mortgage amounts in geographical areas where cost levels so require) by more than one-half thereof. No mortgage with respect to a project or property in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands shall be accepted for insurance under this chapter unless the Secretary finds that the project or property is an acceptable risk giving consideration to the acute housing shortage in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands: <em>Provided</em>, That any such mortgage may be insured or accepted for insurance without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter that the Secretary find the project or property to be economically sound or an acceptable risk. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter or any other law, the Alaska Housing Authority or the Government of Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Hawaii or any agency or instrumentality thereof shall be eligible as mortgagor or mortgagee, as the case may be, for any of the purposes of mortgage insurance under the provisions of this chapter. Upon application by the mortgagee (1) where the mortgagor is regulated or restricted pursuant to the last sentence of this section or (2) where the Alaska Housing Authority or the Government of Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Hawaii or any agency or instrumentality thereof is the mortgagor or mortgagee, for the insurance of a mortgage under any provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure the mortgage (including advances thereon where otherwise authorized), and to make commitments for the insuring of any such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, under such provision (and this section) without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor shall have paid a prescribed amount on account of such property. Without limiting the authority of the Secretary under any other provision of law, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to any mortgagor in such case (except where the Alaska Housing Authority is the mortgagor or mortgagee), to require the mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods or operation to such an extent and in such manner as the Secretary determines advisable to provide reasonable rentals and sales prices and a reasonable return on the investment.</p>

Premium charges on the insurance of mortgages or loans transferred to the Management Fund or insured pursuant to commitments transferred to the Management Fund may be payable in debentures which are the obligation of either the Management Fund or the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Transfer of funds between Management Fund and General Insurance Fund; investment of monies</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) include such nondwelling facilities as the Secretary deems desirable and consistent with the urban renewal plan or, where appropriate, with the locally developed strategy for neighborhood improvement, conservation or preservation: <em>Provided</em>, That the project shall be predominantly residential and any nondwelling facility included in the mortgage shall be found by the Secretary to contribute to the economic feasibility of the project, and the Secretary shall give due consideration to the possible effect of the project on other business enterprises in the community.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, but as to mortgages coming within the provisions of paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection not to exceed the maximum maturity prescribed by the provisions of section 1709(b)(3) of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">(11) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no home improvement loan made in whole or in part for the purpose specified in clause (A)(ii) of the second sentence of paragraph (1) shall be insured under this subsection if such loan (or the portion thereof which is attributable to such purpose), when added to the aggregate principal balance of any outstanding loans insured under this subsection or section 1709(k) of this title which were made to the same borrower for the purpose so specified (or the portion of such aggregate balance which is attributable to such purpose), would exceed $10,000 or such additional amount as the Secretary has by regulation prescribed in any geographical area where he finds cost levels so require pursuant to the authority vested in him by the proviso in paragraph (2)(i) of this subsection.</p>

If the insurance is paid in cash, there shall be added to such payment an amount equivalent to the interest which the debentures would have earned, computed to a date to be established pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) in the event any mortgage insured under this section pursuant to a commitment to insure entered into before November 30, 1983, is not in default at the expiration of twenty years from the date the mortgage was endorsed for insurance, the mortgagee shall, within a period thereafter to be determined by the Secretary, have the option to assign, transfer, and deliver to the Secretary the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing the same and receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided in this paragraph, upon compliance with such requirements and conditions as to the validity of the mortgage as a first lien and such other matters as may be prescribed by the Secretary at the time the loan is endorsed for insurance. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee debentures having a par value equal to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the assignment, plus accrued interest to such date.

The term &ldquo;going Federal rate&rdquo; as used herein means the annual rate of interest which the Secretary of the Treasury shall specify as applicable to the six-month period (consisting of January through June or July through December) which includes the issuance date of such debentures, which applicable rate for each such six-month period shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by estimating the average yield to maturity, on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations or prices during the month of May or the month of November, as the case may be, next preceding such six-month period, on all outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a maturity date of eight to twelve years from the first day of such month of May or November (or, if no such obligations are outstanding, the obligation next shorter than eight years and the obligation next longer than twelve years, respectively, shall be used), and by adjusting such estimated average annual yield to the nearest one-eight of 1 per centum. The Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to mortgages assigned to him under this paragraph as contained in sections 1713(k) and 1713(<em>l</em>) of this title as to mortgages insured by the Secretary and assigned to him under section 1713 of this title.</p>

Upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery of the credit instrument and the mortgage to the Association, the mortgage insurance contract shall terminate and the mortgagee shall receive insurance benefits as provided in subparagraph (A). The Association is authorized to accept such loan documents in its own name and to hold, service, and sell such loans as agent for the Secretary.

The Secretary shall cause the accepted bid to be published in the Federal Register. Settlement for the sale of the credit instrument and the mortgage securing the credit instrument shall occur not later than 30 business days after the date winning bidders are selected in the auction, unless the Secretary determines that extraordinary circumstances require an extension (not to exceed 60 days) of the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) If no bids are received, the bids that are received are not acceptable to the Secretary, or settlement does not occur within the period under subclause (IV), the mortgagee shall retain all rights (including the right to interest, at a rate to be determined by the Secretary, for the period covering any actions taken under this subparagraph) under this section to assign the mortgage loan to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) As part of the auction process, the Secretary shall agree to provide a monthly interest subsidy payment from the General Insurance Fund to the purchaser under the auction of the original credit instrument or the mortgage securing the credit instrument (and any subsequent holders or assigns who are approved mortgagees). The subsidy payment shall be paid on the first day of each month in an amount equal to the difference between the stated interest due on the mortgage loan and the lowest interest rate necessary to accomplish a sale of the mortgage loan or participation certificates (less the servicing fee, if appropriate) for the then unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest at a rate determined by the Secretary. Each interest subsidy payment shall be treated by the holder of the mortgage as interest paid on the mortgage. The interest subsidy payment shall be provided until the earlier of&mdash;</p>

As amended, subtitles A and B of title II are classified generally to subchapter I (&sect;4101 et seq.) of chapter 42 of this title. Prior to the general revision by Pub.

<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;subtitle a&mdash;general provisions</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title [amending sections 1715z&ndash;6 and 1715z&ndash;15 of this title and sections 1437f, 1472, 1485, and 1487 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] may be cited as the &lsquo;Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insured or assisted under sections 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3), 1715z&ndash;1] could be lost as a result of the termination of low income affordability restrictions;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:603 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in the next decade, more than 465,000 low income housing units produced with assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistance contracts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) some 150,000 units of rural low income housing financed under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1485] are threatened with loss as a result of the prepayment of mortgages by owners;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave national crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the loss of this affordable housing, to encourage the production of which the public has provided substantial benefits over past years, would irreparably damage hard-won progress toward such important and long-established national objectives as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) providing a more adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing that is affordable to low income Americans;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) increasing the supply of housing affordable to low income Americans that is accessible to employment opportunities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) expanding housing opportunities for all Americans, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the provision of an adequate supply of low income housing has depended and will continue to depend upon a strong, long-term partnership between the public and private sectors that accommodates a fair return on investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) recent reductions in Federal housing assistance and tax benefits related to low income housing have increased the incentives for private industry to withdraw from the production and management of low income housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) efforts to retain this housing must take account of specific financial and market conditions that differ markedly from project to project;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) a major review of alternative responses to this threatened loss of affordable housing is now being undertaken by numerous private sector task forces as well as State and local organizations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) until the Congress can act on recommendations that will emerge from this review, interim measures are needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housing and irrevocable displacement of current tenants.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to preserve and retain to the maximum extent practicable as housing affordable to low income families or persons those privately owned dwelling units that were produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to continue the partnership between all levels of government and the private sector in the production and operation of housing that is affordable to low income Americans.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; housing certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to aid in the provision of housing accommodations for servicemen in the armed forces of the United States and their families, servicemen in the United States Coast Guard and their families, and servicemen in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and their families by supplementing the insurance of mortgages under section 1709 of this title with a system of mortgage insurance specially designed to assist the financing required for the construction or purchase of dwellings by those persons. As used in this section, a &ldquo;serviceman&rdquo; means a person to whom the Secretary of Defense (or any officer or employee designated by him), the Secretary of Transportation (or any officer or employee designated by him), or the Secretary of Commerce (or any officer or employee designated by him), as the case may be, has issued a certificate hereunder indicating that such person requires housing, is serving on active duty in the armed forces of the United States, in the United States Coast Guard, or in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has served on active duty for more than two years, but a certificate shall not be issued hereunder to any person ordered to active duty for training purposes only. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Commerce, respectively, are authorized to prescribe rules and regulations governing the issuance of such certificates and may withhold issuance of more than one such certificate to a serviceman whenever in his discretion issuance is not justified due to circumstances resulting from military assignment, or, in the case of the United States Coast Guard or the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility of mortgage for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) be executed by a mortgagor who at the time of application for insurance is certified as a &ldquo;serviceman&rdquo; and who at the time of insurance is the owner of the property and either occupies the property as a principal residence or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of his military assignment, or, in the case of the United States Coast Guard or the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Manner of acceptance; payment of premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe the manner in which a mortgage may be accepted for insurance under this section.

As used herein, &ldquo;the period of ownership by a serviceman&rdquo; means the period, for which premiums are fixed, prior to the date that the Secretary of Defense (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), the Secretary of Transportation (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), or the Secretary of Commerce (or any officer or employee or other person designated by him), as the case may be, furnishes the Secretary with a certification that such ownership (as defined by the Secretary), has terminated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (j), and (k) of section 1710 of this title shall apply to mortgages insured under this section, except that as applied to those mortgages (1) all references to the Fund, or Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, shall refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (2) all references to section 1709 of this title shall refer to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of insurance on mortgages covering single-family dwellings or one-family units in condominium projects if mortgage is assumed by serviceman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to transfer to this section the insurance on any mortgage covering a single-family dwelling or a one-family unit in a condominium project insured under this chapter, if the mortgage indebtedness thereof has been assumed by a serviceman who at the time of assumption is the owner of the property and either occupies the property as a principal residence or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of his military assignment, or, in the case of the United States Coast Guard or the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Extension of period of ownership where serviceman dies while on active duty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a serviceman dies while on active duty in the armed forces of the United States or in the United States Coast Guard or in the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving a surviving widow as owner of the property, the period of ownership by the serviceman (within the meaning of subsection (c) of this section) shall extend for two years beyond the date of the serviceman's death or until the date the widow disposes of the property, whichever date occurs first. The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary of Commerce, as the case may be, shall notify such widow promptly following the serviceman's death of the additional costs to be borne by the mortgagor following termination of the two-year period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insurance of certain assigned mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also have authority to insure under this chapter any mortgage assigned to him in connection with payment under a contract of mortgage insurance or executed in connection with the sale by him of any property acquired under any section or subchapter of this chapter without regard to any limitations or requirements contained in this chapter upon the eligibility of the mortgage, upon the payment of insurance premiums, or upon the terms and conditions of insurance settlement and the benefits of the insurance to be included in such settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance of loans made to cover operating losses of certain projects having existing mortgages insured by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure loans made to cover the operating losses of certain projects that have existing project mortgages insured by the Secretary. Insurance under this subsection shall be in the Secretary's discretion and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, and shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;operating loss&rdquo; means the amount by which the sum of the taxes, interest on the mortgage debt, mortgage insurance premiums, hazard insurance premiums, and the expense of maintenance and operation of the project covered by the mortgage, exceeds the income of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988; and (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the operating loss shall have occurred during the first 24 months after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding the operating loss.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988; (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling; and (iii) shall not cover a subsidized project, as defined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the unreimbursed cash contributions made on or after March 18, 1987, by the project owner for the use of the project, during any period of consecutive months (not exceeding 24 months) in the first 10 years after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary, except that in no event may the amount of the loan exceed the operating loss during such period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the loan shall be made within 10 years after the end of the period of consecutive months referred to in the preceding subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the project shall meet all applicable underwriting and other requirements of the Secretary at the time the loan is to be made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:611 --><p class="statutory-body">(4) Any loan insured pursuant to this subsection shall (A) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee; (B) be secured in such manner as the Secretary shall require; (C) be limited to a term not exceeding the unexpired term of the original mortgage; and (D) be insured under the same section as the original mortgage. The Secretary may provide insurance pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), or pursuant to both such paragraphs, in connection with an existing project mortgage, except that the Secretary may not provide insurance pursuant to both such paragraphs in connection with the same period of months referred to in paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B). The Secretary is authorized to collect a premium charge for insurance of loans pursuant to this subsection in any amount computed at the same premium rate as is applicable to the original mortgage. This premium shall be payable in cash or in debentures of the insurance fund under which the loan is insured at par plus accrued interest. In the event of a failure of the borrower to make any payment due under such loan or under the original mortgage, both the loan and original mortgage shall be considered in default, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to insurance benefits, computed in the same manner as for the original mortgage, except that in determining the interest rate under section 1715<em>o</em> of this title for the debentures representing the portion of the claim applicable to the loan, the date of the commitment to insure the loan and the insurance date of the loan shall be taken into consideration rather than the commitment or insurance date for the original mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A loan involving a project covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715e of this title that is the obligation of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund shall be the obligation of such fund, and loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715z&ndash;1 of this title or under any section of this subchapter pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In determining the amount of an operating loss loan to be insured pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall not reduce such amount solely to reflect any amounts placed in escrow (at the time the existing project mortgage was insured) for initial operating deficits. If an operating loss loan was insured by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection before October 28, 1992, and was reduced solely to reflect the amount placed in escrow for initial operating deficits, the Secretary shall insure, to the extent of the availability of insurance authority provided in appropriation Acts, an increase in the existing loan or a separate loan, in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the maximum amount permitted under this subsection and the applicable underwriting requirements established by the Secretary and in effect at the time the loan is to be made, or (B) the amount of the escrow for initial operating deficits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property in older, declining urban areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter except section 1715c of this title, and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX&ndash;B of this chapter, other than the limitation in section 1709(g) of this title, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX&ndash;B of this chapter a mortgage executed in connection with the repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property located in an older, declining urban area in which the conditions are such that one or more of the eligibility requirements applicable to the section or subchapter under which insurance is sought could not be met if the Secretary finds that (1) the area is reasonably viable, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing or group practice facilities for families of low and moderate income in such area, and (2) the property is an acceptable risk in view of such consideration. The insurance of a mortgage pursuant to this subsection shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with purchase or refinancing of existing multifamily housing project; refinancing of existing debt of existing hospital, or purchase or refinancing of rental rehabilitated property; terms and conditions, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized, in his discretion, to insure under any section of this subchapter a mortgage executed in connection with the purchase of refinancing of an existing multifamily housing project or the refinancing of existing debt of an existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of the purchase or refinancing under this subsection of a multifamily housing project located in an older, declining urban area, the Secretary shall make available an amount not to exceed $30,000,000 of available purchase authority pursuant to section 1720 of this title to reduce interest rates on low- and moderate-income rental housing in projects having 100 units or less which otherwise could not support refinancing and moderate rehabilitation without causing excessive rent burdens on current tenants due to rent increases. The Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as he deems necessary to assure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the refinancing is used to lower the monthly debt service only to the extent necessary to assure the continued economic viability of the project, taking into account any rent reductions to be implemented by the mortgagor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) during the mortgage term no rental increases shall be made except those which are necessary to offset actual and reasonable operating expense increases or other necessary ex<!-- PDFPage:612 -->pense increases and maintain reasonable profit levels approved by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgage shall be executed by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may in his discretion require any such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to charges and methods of financing, and, in addition thereto, if the mortgagor is a corporate entity, as to capital structure and rate of return. As an aid to the regulation or restriction of any mortgagor with respect to any of the foregoing matters, the Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) With respect to nursing homes and intermediate care facilities and combined nursing home and intermediate care facilities, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless he has received, from the State agency designated in accordance with section 604(a)(1) or section 1521&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715w_3_target" name="1715w_3">3</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 291d (a)(1), 300m] for the State in which is located the nursing home or intermediate care facility or combined nursing home and intermediate care facility covered by the mortgage, a certification that (i) there is a need for such home or facility or combined home and facility, and (ii) there are in force in such State or in the municipality or other political subdivision of the State in which the proposed home or facility or combined home and facility is to be located reasonable minimum standards of licensure and methods of operation governing it. No such mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary has received such assurance as he may deem satisfactory from the State agency that such standards will be applied and enforced with respect to any home or facility or combined home and facility located in the State for which mortgage insurance is provided under this section. If no such State agency exists, or if the State agency exists but is not empowered to provide a certification that there is a need for the home or facility or combined home and facility as required in clause (i) of the first sentence, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless (i) the State in which the home or facility or combined home and facility is located has conducted or commissioned and paid for the preparation of an independent study of market need and feasibility that (I) is prepared in accordance with the principles established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; (II) assesses, on a marketwide basis, the impact of the proposed home or facility or combined home and facility on, and its relationship to, other health care facilities and services, the percentage of excess beds, demographic projections, alternative health care delivery systems, and the reimbursement structure of the home, facility, or combined home and facility; (III) is addressed to and is acceptable to the Secretary in form and substance; and (IV) in the event the State does not prepare the study, is prepared by a financial consultant who is selected by the State or the applicant for mortgage insurance and is approved by the Secretary; and (ii) the State complies with the other provisions of this subparagraph that would otherwise be required to be met by a State agency designated in accordance with section 604(a)(1) or section 1521&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715w_3_target" name="1715w_3">3</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) With respect to board and care homes, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless he has received from the appropriate State licensing agency a statement verifying that the State in which the home is or is to be located is in compliance with the provisions of section 1616(e) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1382e(e)].</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Secretary determines that the level of financing acquired by the mortgagor and any other resources available for the facility will be sufficient to ensure that the facility contains dwelling units and facilities for the provision of supportive services in accordance with subsection (b)(6) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the mortgagor provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that each dwelling unit in the facility will not be occupied by more than 1 person without the consent of all such occupants; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to assist in lowering housing costs and improving housing standards, quality, livability, or durability or neighborhood design through the utilization of advanced housing technology, or experimental property standards, the Secretary is authorized to insure and to make commitments to insure, under this section, mortgages (including home improvement loans, and including advances on mortgages during construction) secured by properties including dwellings involving the utilization and testing of advanced technology in housing design, materials, or construction, or experimental property standards for neighborhood design if the Secretary determines that (A) the property is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the need for testing advanced housing technology or experimental property standards, (B) the utilization and testing of the advanced technology or experimental property standards involved will provide data or experience which the Secretary deems to be significant in reducing housing costs or improving housing standards, quality, livability, or durability, or improving neighborhood design, and (C) the mortgages are eligible for insurance under the provisions of this section and under any further terms and conditions which may be prescribed by the Secretary to establish the acceptability of the mortgages for insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is further authorized to insure and to make commitments to insure, under this section, mortgages (including advances on mortgages during construction) secured by properties in projects to be carried out in accordance with plans approved by the Secretary under section 1701z of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance; conditions; limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall meet the requirements of one of the other sections or subchapters of this chapter; except that, in lieu of determining the appraised value or the replacement cost of the property in cases involving new construction or the estimated cost of repair and rehabilitation of improvement in cases involving existing properties, the Secretary shall estimate the cost of replacing the property using comparable conventional design, materials, and construction, and any limitation upon the maximum mortgage amount available to a nonoccupant owner shall not, in the discretion of the Secretary, be applicable to mortgages insured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contracts, agreements, and financial undertakings with mortgagor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into such contracts, agreements, and financial undertakings with the mortgagor and others as he deems necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this section, and may expend available funds for such purposes, including the correction (when he determines it necessary to protect the occupants), at any time subsequent to insurance of a mortgage, of defects or failures in the dwellings which the Secretary finds are caused by or related to the advanced housing technology utilized in their design or construction or experimental property standards. Any authority which the Secretary may exercise in connection with a mortgage, or property covered by a mortgage, insured under any other section of this subchapter (including payments to reduce rentals for, or to facilitate homeownership by, lower income families) may be exercised in connection with a mortgage, or property covered by a mortgage, meeting the requirements of such other section (except as specified in subsection (b) of this section), which is insured under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as if the mortgage insured under this section was insured under such other section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investigations and analysis of data; publication and distribution of reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make such investigations and analyses of data, and publish and distribute such reports, as he determines to be necessary or desirable to assure the most beneficial use of the data and information to be acquired as a result of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Entitlement to insurance benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee or lender under a mortgage insured under subsection (b) of this section shall be entitled to insurance benefits determined in the same manner as such benefits would be determined if such mortgage or loan were insured under the section or subchapter of this chapter for which it otherwise would have been eligible except for the experimental feature of the property involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Defaults; payment in cash or debentures; acquisition of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, in the case of default on any <!-- PDFPage:629 -->mortgage insured under this section, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such subsections in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire the mortgage loan and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage. After the acquisition of the mortgage by the Secretary the mortgagee shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations with respect to the mortgage. The appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the issuance of debentures shall apply with respect to debentures issued under this subsection, and the appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a mortgagee shall apply with respect to the Secretary when he has acquired an insured mortgage under this subsection, in accordance with and subject to regulations (modifying such provisions to the extent necessary to render their application for such purposes appropriate and effective) which shall be prescribed by the Secretary, except that as applied to mortgages insured under this section (1) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (2) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section. If the insurance payment is made in cash, there shall be added to such payment an amount equivalent to the interest which the debentures would have earned, computed to a date to be established pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>

The mortgage shall contain such provisions as the Secretary determines to be necessary for the maintenance of common areas and facilities and the multifamily project. The mortgagor shall have exclusive right to the use of the one-family unit covered by the mortgage and, together with the owners of other units in the multifamily project, shall have the right to the use of the common areas and facilities serving the project and the obligation of maintaining all such common areas and facilities. The Secretary may require that the rights and obligations of the mortgagor and the owners of other dwelling units in the project shall be subject to such controls as he determines to be necessary and feasible to promote and protect individual owners, the multifamily project, and its occupants. For the purposes of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe to permit one-family units and interests in common areas and facilities in multifamily projects covered by mortgages insured under any section of this chapter (other than section 1715e(a)(1) and (2) of this title) to be released from the liens of those mortgages.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may, in the Secretary's discretion, be regulated or restricted as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulation or restriction of such mortgagor. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par at any time upon the request of the Secretary after the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Eligibility for insurance of blanket mortgages of multifamily projects</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any blanket mortgage insured under subsection (d) of this section shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe but not to exceed 40 years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the blanket mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the blanket mortgage may provide for such release. The project covered by the blanket mortgage may include four or more family units and such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may further increase the dollar amount limitations which would otherwise apply under subsection (e) of this section by not to exceed 20 per centum if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of a project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715y_1_target" name="1715y_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1715z. Homeownership or membership in cooperative association for lower income families</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic assistance payments to mortgagees; assistance to manufactured home buyers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of assisting lower income families in acquiring homeownership or in acquiring membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of such homeowners and cooperative members. The assistance shall be accomplished through payments to mortgagees holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section or which mortgages are assisted under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance or tax abatement. In making such assistance available, the Secretary shall give preference to low-income families who, without such assistance, would be likely to be involuntarily displaced (including those who would be likely to be displaced from rental units which are to be converted into a condominium project or a cooperative project). Such assistance may include the acquisition of a condominium or a membership in a cooperative association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments under this section on behalf of families whose incomes do not exceed the maximum income limits prescribed pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section for the purpose of assisting such families in acquiring ownership of a manufactured home consisting of two or more modules and a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, except that periodic assistance payments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this section after January 1, 1976. Assistance payments under this section pursuant to this paragraph shall be accomplished through payments on behalf of an owner of lower-income of a manufactured home as described in the preceding sentence to the financial institution which makes the loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation rep<!-- PDFPage:635 -->resenting the loan or advance of credit to finance the purchase of the manufactured home and the lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, but only if insurance under section 1703 of this title covering such loan, advance of credit, or obligation has been granted to such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, assistance payments provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, real and personal property taxes, insurance, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title due under the loan or advance of credit remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the manufactured homeowner's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear interest at a rate derived by subtracting from the interest rate applicable to such loan or advance of credit the interest rate differential between the maximum interest rate plus mortgage insurance premium applicable to mortgages insured under subsection (i) of this section at the time such loan or advance of credit is made and the interest rate which such mortgages are presumed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to bear for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications and eligibility requirements for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for assistance payments, the homeowner or the cooperative member shall be of lower income and satisfy eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the homeowner shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which meets the requirements of and is insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That a mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section but insured under section 1715z&ndash;2 of this title may qualify for assistance payments if such mortgage was executed by a mortgagor who is determined not to be an acceptable credit risk for mortgage insurance purposes (but otherwise eligible) under subsection (j)(4) of this section or under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(2) or 1715y(c) of this title and accepted as a reasonably satisfactory credit risk under section 1715z&ndash;2 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the cooperative association of which the family is a member shall operate (A) a housing project the construction or substantial rehabilitation of which has been financed with a mortgage insured under section 1715e or section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) of this title and which has been completed within two years prior to the filing of the application for assistance payments and the dwelling unit has had no previous occupant other than the family: <em>Provided</em>, That if any cooperative member who has received assistance payments transfers his membership and occupancy rights to another person who satisfies the eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary and undertakes the obligation to pay occupancy charges, the new cooperative member may qualify for assistance payments upon the filing of an application with respect to the dwelling unit involved to be occupied by him: <em>Provided further</em>, That assistance payments may be made with respect to a dwelling unit in an existing cooperative project which meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe, if the family qualifies as a displaced family as defined in section 1715<em>l</em>(f) of this title, or a family which includes five or more minor persons, or a family occupying low-rent public housing: <em>Provided further</em>, That the amount of the mortgage attributable to the dwelling unit shall involve a principal obligation not in excess of $40,000 ($47,500 in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that costs levels so require), except that with respect to any family with five or more persons the foregoing limits shall be $47,500 and $55,000, respectively; or (B) a housing project which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which prior to completion of construction or rehabilitation is approved for receiving the benefits of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on payments on behalf of mortgagor; occupancy of property; maximum amount of payment; recapture of amounts; determination, applicability, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, the assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a mortgagor shall be made during such time as the mortgagor shall continue to occupy the property which secures the mortgage: <em>Provided</em>, That assistance payments may be made on behalf of a homeowner who assumes a mortgage insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) of this section with respect to which assistance payments have been made on behalf of the previous owner, if the homeowner is approved by the Secretary as eligible for receiving such assistance: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such assistance payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary. Assistance payments pursuant to any new contract, other than a contract in connection with a refinancing under subsection (r) of this section, entered into after September 30, 1983, that utilizes authority approved in appropriation Acts for any fiscal year beginning after such date may not be made for more than a 10-year period. The payment shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance premium due under the mortgage remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the mortgagor's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage <!-- PDFPage:636 -->and the monthly payment for principal and interest which the mortgagor would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum (4 per centum per annum in the case of a mortgage described in subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon disposition by the homeowner of any property assisted pursuant to this section or where the homeowner rents such a property (or the owner's unit in the case of a two- to four-family property) for a period longer than one year, the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of assistance actually received under this section, other than any amount provided under subsection (e) of this section, or (ii) an amount equal to at least 50 per centum of the net appreciation of the property, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;net appreciation of the property&rdquo; means any increase in the value of the property over the original purchase price, less the reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made to the property, and any increase in the mortgage amount as of the time of sale over the original mortgage balance due to the mortgage being insured pursuant to section 1715z&ndash;10 of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance shall constitute a debt secured by the property to the extent that the Secretary may provide for such recapture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to any property with respect to which there is assumption in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection or to any property which is subject to a mortgage, loan, or other advance of credit insured pursuant to subsection (q) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) There hereby is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund, which, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, may be used by the Secretary for purposes of carrying out subparagraph (B). There shall be deposited into such fund (i) any amount recaptured under paragraph (2); (ii) any authority to make assistance payments under subsection (a) of this section that is committed for use in a contract but is unused because the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved is refinanced (except to the extent provided in subsection (r) of this section for mortgages insured under such subsection) or because such assistance payments are terminated or suspended for other reasons before the original termination date of such contract; and (iii) any amount received under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of any homeowner whose assistance payments are terminated by reason of the 10-year limitation referred to in paragraph (1), and who is determined by the Secretary to be unable to assume the full payments due under the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved, the Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of amounts in the fund established in subparagraph (A), contract to make, and make, continued assistance payments on behalf of such homeowner. Such continued assistance payments shall be made in an amount determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (1) or subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section and for such period as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any amounts in such fund determined by the Secretary to be in excess of the amounts currently required to carry out the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall be invested by the Secretary in obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by, the United States or any agency of the United States. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any amounts of budget authority or contract authority recaptured from assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages that are being refinanced that are not required for assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages insured under this subsection, shall be rescinded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on payments on behalf of family holding membership in cooperative association; occupancy; maximum amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a family holding membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project shall be made only during such time as the family is an occupant of such project and shall be in amounts computed on the basis of the formula set forth in subsection (c) of this section applying the cooperative member's proportionate share of the obligations under the project mortgage to the items specified in the formula.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic interest reduction payments&nbsp; on&nbsp; behalf&nbsp; of&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; rental&nbsp; housing project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of reducing rentals for lower income families, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed for occupancy by lower income families, which shall be accomplished through payments to morgagees&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_1_target" name="1715z-1_1">1</a></sup> holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restrictions on payments; payments with respect to projects financed under State or local programs; mortgage insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest reduction payments with respect to a project shall only be made during such time as the project is operated as a rental housing project and is subject to a mortgage which meets the requirements of, and is insured under, subsection (j) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such interest reduction payments where the <!-- PDFPage:647 -->mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary: <em>Provided further</em>, That interest reduction payments may be made with respect to a mortgage or part thereof on a rental or cooperative housing project owned by a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend entity, public&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_2_target" name="1715z-1_2">2</a></sup> entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. The term &ldquo;mortgage insurance premium&rdquo;, when used in this section in relation to a project financed by a loan under a State or local program, means such fees and charges, approved by the Secretary, as are payable by the mortgagor to the State or local agency mortgagee to meet reserve requirements and administrative expenses of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest reduction payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a project owner shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the project owner as a mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such project owner would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgage handling expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (c) of this section, as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of project in accordance with requirements respecting tenant eligibility and rents prescribed by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As a condition for receiving the benefits of interest reduction payments, the project owner shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe. Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for review of tenant incomes at intervals of one year (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Establishment of basic and fair market rental charges; rental for dwelling units; separate utility metering; additional assistance payments for low-income tenants; limitations; amounts; approval of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For each dwelling unit there shall be established with the approval of the Secretary (A) a basic rental charge determined on the basis of operating the project with payments of principal and interest due under a mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum; and (B) a fair market rental charge determined on the basis of operating the project with payments of principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage covering the project. The rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the fair market rental charge determined pursuant to this paragraph, as represents 30 per centum of the tenant's adjusted income. However, in the case of a project which contains more than 5,000 units, is subject to an interest reduction payments contract, and is financed under a State or local program, the Secretary may reduce the rental charge ceiling, but in no case shall the rent be below basic rent. For plans of action approved for Capital Grants under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA) [12 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.] or the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA), the rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the lower of (i) the fair market rental charge determined pursuant to this paragraph, or (ii) the actual rent paid for a comparable unit in comparable unassisted housing in the market area in which the housing assisted under this section is located, as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income, but in no case shall the rent be below basic rent. With respect to those projects which the Secretary determines have separate utility metering for some or all dwelling units, the Secretary is authorized&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to permit the basic rental charge and the fair market rental charge to be determined on the basis of operating the project without the payment of the cost of utility services used by such dwelling units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to permit the charging of a rental for such dwelling units at such an amount less than 30 per centum of a tenant's adjusted income as the Secretary determines represents a proportionate decrease for the utility charges to be paid by such tenant, but in no case shall such rental be lower than 25 per centum of a tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any project made subject to a contract under this section after August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall make, and contract to make, additional assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of tenants whose incomes are too low for them to afford the basic rentals (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) with 30 per centum of their adjusted income. The additional assistance payments authorized by this paragraph with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the amount required to reduce the rental payment (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) by the tenant to the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 30 per centum of the tenant's monthly adjusted income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 10 per centum of the tenant's monthly income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance <!-- PDFPage:648 -->with the family's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary to assure the economic viability of the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary and feasible in order to, assure, insofar as is practicable, that there is in the project a reasonable range in the income levels of tenants, or that such action is to be taken to meet the housing needs of elderly or handicapped families.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall utilize amounts credited to the fund described in subsection (g) of this section for the sole purpose of carrying out the purposes of section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. No payments may be made from such fund unless approved in an appropriation Act. No amount may be so approved for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To ensure that eligible tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this subsection immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into under this subsection with owners of projects assisted but not subject to mortgages insured under this section to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of eligible tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under section 1437c(c) of title 42. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In order to induce advances by owners for capital improvements (excluding any owner contributions that may be required by the Secretary as a condition for assistance under section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978) to benefit projects assisted under this section, in establishing basic rental charges and fair market rental charges under paragraph (1) the Secretary may include an amount that would permit a return of such advances with interest to the owner out of project income, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine. Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Assistance under section 1437f of title 42 shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriations Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effects on income-eligible tenants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Repealed. Pub. L. 104&ndash;99, title IV, &sect;405(d)(2), Jan. 26, 1996, 110 Stat. 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall determine whether and under what conditions the provisions of this subsection shall apply to mortgages sold by the Secretary on a negotiated basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Collection of excess rental charges; credit to reserve fund for additional assistance payments; retention by project owner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The project owner shall, as required by the Secretary, accumulate, safeguard, and periodically pay the Secretary or such other entity as determined by the Secretary and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, all rental charges collected on a unit-by-unit basis in excess of the basic rental charges. Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, such excess charges shall be credited to a reserve fund to be used by the Secretary to make additional assistance payments as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (f) of this section. However, a project owner with a mortgage insured under this section may retain some or all of such excess charges for project use if authorized by the Secretary and upon such terms and conditions as established by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to establishing the requirements specified in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make such rules and regulations, to enter into such agreements, and to adopt such procedures as he may deem necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of contracts; contracts for assistance payments; income limitations; availability of amounts for projects approved prior to rehabilitation and projects for occupancy by elderly or handicapped families; definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including such sums as may be necessary to make interest reduction payments under contracts entered into by the Secretary under this section. The aggregate amount of outstanding contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $75,000,000 per annum prior to July 1, 1969, which maximum dollar amount shall be increased by $125,000,000 on July 1, 1969, by $150,000,000 on July 1, 1970, by $200,000,000 on July 1, 1971 and by $75,000,000 on July 1, 1974. The Secretary shall utilize, to the extent necessary after September 30, 1984, any authority under this section that is recaptured either as the result of the conversion of housing projects covered by assistance under subsection (f)(2) of this section to contracts for assistance under section 1437f of title 42 or otherwise for <!-- PDFPage:649 -->the purpose of making assistance payments, including amendments as provided in subsection (f)(4) of this section, with respect to housing projects assisted, but not subject to mortgages insured, under this section that remain covered by assistance under subsection (f)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Contracts for assistance payments under this section may be entered into only with respect to tenants whose incomes do not exceed 80 per centum of the median family income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of his findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low family incomes, or other factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not less than 10 per centum of the total amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized by appropriation Acts to be made after June 30, 1974, shall be available for use only with respect to dwellings, or dwelling units in projects, which are approved by the Secretary prior to rehabilitation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Amount of assistance for capital improvements; term of loan; rate of interest; allowance for administrative costs and probable program losses; nondischargeable liability; other forms for loans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized upon application by the mortgagee to insure under this section any mortgage meeting the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) be executed by a mortgagor who the Secretary has determined, after a full and complete study of the case, would not be an acceptable credit risk for mortgage insurance purposes under sections 1709, 1715k, 1715<em>l</em>, 1715y, or 1715z(j)(4) of this title, because of his credit standing, debt obligations, total annual income, or income characteristics, but who the Secretary is satisfied would be a reasonably satisfactory credit risk, consistent with the objectives stated in subsection (a) of this section, if he were to receive budget, debt management, and related counseling: <em>Provided</em>, That, in determining whether the mortgagor is a reasonably satisfactory credit risk, the Secretary shall review the credit history of the applicant giving special consideration to those delinquent accounts which were ultimately paid by the applicant and to extenuating factors which may have caused credit accounts of the applicant to become delinquent; and the Secretary shall also give special consideration to income characteristics of applicants whose total income over the two years prior to their applications has remained at levels of eligibility (as required under paragraph (4) of this subsection), but who, because of the character of this seasonal employment or for other reasons, have not maintained continuous employment under one employer during that time; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) require monthly payments which, in combination with local real estate taxes on the property involved, do not exceed 25 per centum of the applicant's income, based on his average monthly income during the year prior to his application or the average monthly income during the three years prior to his application, whichever is higher.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preferences in approving mortgage insurance applications and in providing counseling services; eligible families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall give preference in approving mortgage insurance applications and in providing counseling services under this section (1) to families which are eligible for assistance payments under section 1715z of this title, and (2) to families living in public housing units, especially those families required to leave public housing because their incomes have risen beyond the maximum prescribed income limits, and families eligible for residence in public housing who have been displaced from federally assisted urban renewal areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Budget, debt management, and related counseling services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to provide, or contract with public or private organizations to provide, such budget, debt management, and related counseling services to mortgagors whose mortgages are insured under this section as he determines to be necessary to meet the objectives of this section.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Aggregate principal balance of mortgages insured</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate principal balance of all mortgages insured under this section and outstanding at one time shall not exceed $200,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Sec<!-- PDFPage:669 -->retary&rdquo;) may request the Attorney General to bring an action in a United States district court to recover any assets or income used by any person in violation of (A) a regulatory agreement that applies to a multifamily project whose mortgage is insured or held by the Secretary under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]; (B) a regulatory agreement that applies to a multifamily project whose mortgage is insured or held by the Secretary under section 1701q of this title (including property subject to section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990); (C) a regulatory agreement or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary that applies to mortgages insured or held by the Secretary under section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, but not reinsured under section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992; or (D) any applicable regulation. For purposes of this section, a use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation shall include any use for which the documentation in the books and accounts does not establish that the use was made for a reasonable operating expense or necessary repair of the project and has not been maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary and in reasonable condition for proper audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of a mortgage insured or held by the Secretary under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.], under section 1701q of this title (including section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990) and under section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, the term &ldquo;any person&rdquo; shall mean any person or entity which owns a project, as identified in the regulatory agreement, including but not limited to any stockholder holding 25 percent or more interest of a corporation that owns the project; any beneficial owner under any business or trust; any officer, director, or partner of an entity owning the project; and any heir, assignee, successor in interest, or agent of any owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation of proceedings and temporary relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General, upon request of the Secretary, shall have the exclusive authority to authorize the initiation of proceedings under this section. Pending final resolution of any action under this section, the court may grant appropriate temporary or preliminary relief, including restraining orders, injunctions, and acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, to protect the interests of the Secretary and to prevent use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, and any applicable regulation and to prevent loss of value of the realty and personalty involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount recoverable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any judgment favorable to the United States entered under this section, the Attorney General may recover double the value of the assets and income of the project that the court determines to have been used in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation, plus all costs relating to the action, including but not limited to reasonable attorney and auditing fees. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may apply the recovery, or any portion of the recovery, to the project or to the applicable insurance fund under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] or, in the case of any project for which the mortgage is held by the Secretary under section 1701q of this title (including property subject to section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990), to the project or to the Department for use by the appropriate office within the Department for administrative costs related to enforcement of the requirements of the various programs administered by the Secretary, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time limitation</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination by Secretary of necessity; interest subsidy payments; effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever he determines such action to be necessary in furtherance of the purposes set forth in section 501 of the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of families of middle income. The assistance shall be accomplished through interest subsidy payments to the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the investor&rdquo;) with respect to mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section and made after July 24, 1970.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications of mortgagor for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for assistance payments a middle-income family shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which is (1) insured under subsection (j) of this section, (2) guaranteed under chapter 37 of title 38, or (3) a conventional mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (j)(3) of this section. In addition to the foregoing requirement, the Secretary may require that the mortgagor have an income, at the time of acquisition of the property, of not more than the median income for the area in which the property is located, as determined by the Secretary, with appropriate adjustments for smaller and larger families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of interest subsidy payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest subsidy payments authorized by this section shall cease when (1) the mortgagor no longer occupies the property which secures the mortgage, (2) the mortgages are no longer held by the investor, or (3) the rate of interest paid by the mortgagor reaches the rate of interest specified on the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Monthly mortgage payments as determining eligibility for interest subsidy payments; mortgage assistance payments for middle-income cooperative members; interest subsidy payments; applicability of provisions to cooperative mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Interest subsidy payments shall be on mortgages on which the mortgagor makes monthly payments towards principal and interest equal to an amount which would be required if the mortgage bore an effective interest rate of 7 per centum per annum including any discounts or charges in the nature of points or otherwise (but not including premiums, if any, for mortgage insurance) or such higher rate (not to exceed the rate specified in the mortgage), which the mortgagor could pay by applying at least 20 per centum of his income towards homeownership expenses. As used in this subsection, the <!-- PDFPage:677 -->term &ldquo;monthly homeownership expense&rdquo; includes the monthly payment for principal, interest, mortgage insurance premium, insurance, and taxes due under the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the mortgages eligible for assistance under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments on behalf of cooperative members of middle income. Such assistance payments shall be accomplished through interest subsidy payments to the investor with respect to mortgages insured (subsequent to July 24, 1970) under section 1715e of this title which are executed by cooperatives, the membership in which is limited to middle-income families. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a cooperative mortgagor, subsection (c) of this section shall not apply and the interest subsidy payments shall cease when the mortgage is no longer held by the investor or the cooperative fails to limit membership to families whose incomes at the time of their application for a dwelling unit meets such requirements as are laid down by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of interest subsidy payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest subsidy payments shall be in an amount equal to the difference, as determined by the Secretary, between the total amount of interest per calendar quarter received by the investor on mortgages assisted under this section and purchased by it and the total amount of interest which the investor would have received if the yield on such mortgages was equal to the sum of (1) the average costs (expressed as an annual percentage rate) to it of all borrowed funds outstanding in the immediately preceding calendar quarter, and (2) such per centum per annum as will provide for administrative and other expenses of the investor and a reasonable economic return, as determined by the Secretary to be necessary and appropriate taking into account the purpose of this section to provide additional mortgage credit at reasonable rates of interest to middle-income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Adoption of procedures for recertifications of mortgagor's income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertifications of the mortgagor's income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of the mortgagor's payments pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations to assure that sales price or other consideration paid is not increased above appraised value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not increased above the appraised value on which the maximum mortgage which the Secretary will insure is computed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of assistance payment contracts; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to make interest subsidy payments under contracts entered into under this section. The aggregate amount of contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $105,000,000 during the first year of such contracts prior to July 1, 1971, which amount shall be increased by an additional $105,000,000 during the first year of an additional number of such contracts on July 1 of each of the years 1971 and 1972.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No interest subsidy payments under this section shall be made after June 30, 1973, except pursuant to contracts entered into on or before such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Determination of family income; exclusion of income of minors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the income of any family for the purposes of this section, income from all sources of each member of the family in the household shall be included, except that the Secretary shall exclude income earned by any minor person.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary; request of mortgagee; premium charges; provisions of contract of co-insurance; non-applicability of state insurance laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to providing insurance as otherwise authorized under this chapter, and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter inconsistent with this section, the Secretary, upon request of any mortgagee and for such mortgage insurance premium as he may prescribe (which premium, or other charges to be paid by the mortgagor, shall not exceed the premium, or other charges, that would otherwise be applicable), may insure and make a commitment to insure under any provision of this subchapter any mortgage, advance, or loan otherwise eligible under such provision, pursuant to a co-insurance contract providing that the mortgagee will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assume a percentage of any loss on the insured mortgage, advance, or loan in direct proportion to the amount of the co-insurance, which co-insurance shall not be less than 10 per centum, subject to any reasonable limit or limits on the liability of the mortgagee that may be specified in the event of unusual or catastrophic losses that may be incurred by any one mortgagee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) carry out (under a delegation or otherwise and with or without compensation but subject to audit, exception, or review requirements) such credit approval, appraisal, inspection, commitment, property disposition, or other functions as the Secretary, pursuant to regulations, shall approve as consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any contract of co-insurance under this section shall contain such provisions relating to the sharing of premiums on a sound actuarial basis, establishment of mortgage reserves, manner of calculating insurance benefits, conditions with respect to foreclosure, handling and disposition of property prior to claim or settlement, rights of assignees (which may elect not to be subject to the loss sharing provisions), and other similar matters as the Secretary may prescribe pursuant to regulations. A mortgagee which enters into a contract of co-insurance under this section shall not by reason of such contract, or its adherence to such contract or applicable regulations of the Secretary, including provisions relating to the retention of risks in the event of sale or assignment of a mortgage, be made subject to any State law regulating the business of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inspection of construction of dwellings or projects as prerequisite; minimum standards or criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No insurance shall be granted pursuant to this section with respect to dwellings or projects approved for insurance prior to the beginning of construction unless the inspection of such construction is conducted in accordance with at least the minimum standards and criteria used with respect to dwellings or projects approved for mortgage insurance pursuant to other provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, title IV, &sect;414(a), Feb. 5, 1988, 101 Stat. 1907</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability unaffecting insurance otherwise authorized; criteria for exercise of authority by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not withdraw, deny, or delay insurance otherwise authorized under any other provision of this chapter by reason of the <!-- PDFPage:679 -->availability of insurance pursuant to this section. The Secretary shall exercise his authority under this section only to the extent that he finds that the continued exercise of such authority will not adversely affect the flow of mortgage credit to older and declining neighborhoods and to the purchasers of older and lower cost housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Multifamily housing project; contract provisions; aggregate principal amount of all mortgages insured; loans on defaulted mortgages; insurance for state assisted projects and projects under construction; definitions; amount of reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where the mortgage covers a multifamily housing project, the co-insurance contract may provide that the mortgagee assume (i) the full amount of any loss on the insured mortgage up to an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage at the time of claim for insurance benefits, or (ii) the full amount of any losses on insured mortgages in a portfolio of mortgages approved by the Secretary up to an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the outstanding principal balance of all mortgages in such portfolio at the time of claim for insurance benefits on a mortgage in the portfolio, plus a share of any loss in excess of the amount under clause (i) or (ii), whichever is applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make loans, from the applicable insurance fund, to public housing agencies in connection with mortgages which have been insured pursuant to this subsection and which are in default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may insure and make a commitment to insure in connection with a co-insurance contract pursuant to this subsection (A) a mortgage on a project assisted under the second proviso in the fist sentence of section 1715z&ndash;1(b) of this title, and (B) a mortgage or advance on a mortgage made to a public housing agency on a project under construction which is not approved for insurance prior to construction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;public housing agency&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 1437a(b)(6) of title 42.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary may include in the determination of replacement cost of a project to be covered by a mortgage made to a public housing agency and insured pursuant to this subsection, such reserves and development costs, not to exceed 5 per centum of the amount otherwise allowable, as may be established or authorized by the public housing agency consistent with such agency's procedures and underwriting standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Redesignated (f)</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Acceptable co-insurance provisions for rental rehabilitation; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the case of a mortgage insured under section 1715n(f) of this title secured by property which is to be rehabilitated or developed under section 1437<em>o</em>&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-9_1_target" name="1715z-9_1">1</a></sup> of title 42, such co-insurance may include provisions that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) insurance benefits shall equal the sum of (A) 90 per centum of the mortgage on the date of institution of foreclosure proceedings (or on the date of acquisition of the property otherwise after default), and (B) 90 per centum of interest arrears on the date benefits are paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the mortgagee shall remit to the Secretary, for credit to the General Insurance Fund, 90 per centum of any proceeds of the property, including sale proceeds, net of the mortgagee's actual and reasonable costs related to the property and the enforcement of security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) payment of such benefits shall be made in cash unless the mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the underwriter of co-insurance may reinsure 10 per centum of the mortgage amount with a private mortgage insurance company or with a State mortgage insurance agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-9_2_target" name="1715z-9_2">2</a></sup> Authority of mortgagee to assign its interest in any note or mortgage subject to a contract of co-insurance; terms and conditions respecting retention of co-insurance risk of such note or mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee which enters into a contract of co-insurance under this section shall have the authority to assign its interest in any note or mortgage subject to a contract of co-insurance to a warehouse bank or other financial institution which provides interim funding for a loan co-insured under this section, and to retain the co-insurance risk of such note or mortgage, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, by January 15 and July 15 of each year (1) review the adequacy of capital and other requirements for mortgagees under this section, (2) assess the compliance by mortgagees with such requirements, and (3) make such adjustment to such requirements as the Secretary, after providing opportunity for hearing, determines to be appropriate to improve the long-term financial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration funds. Such requirements shall include the minimum capital or net worth of mortgagees; the ratio that mortgagees shall maintain between the mortgagee's capital and the volume of mortgages co-insured by such mortgagee; and such other requirements as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure the long-term financial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration funds. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on the review and assessment under the previous sentence, and an explanation of the Secretary's reasons for making any adjustment in requirements authorized under this section.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria; principal obligation limitation; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter mortgages and loans with provisions of varying rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in family income or with monthly payments and outstanding balances adjusted by a percentage change in a selected price index to the extent he determines such mortgages or loans (1) have promise for expanding housing opportunities or meet special needs, (2) can be developed to include any safeguards for mortgagors or purchasers that may be necessary to offset special risks of such mortgages, and (3) have a potential for acceptance in the private market. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the principal obligation (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) of a mortgage insured pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 97 per centum of the appraised value of the property covered by the mortgage as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, or if the mortgagor is a veteran and the mortgage is to be insured in accordance with the provisions of section 1709 of this title, such higher percentage of appraised value as is provided for purposes of determining the maximum mortgage amount eligible for insurance under section 1709(b)(2) of this title in the case of veterans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inapplicability of principal obligation limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage or loan which meets the requirements of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and which has provisions for varying rates of amortization if the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the mortgagor could not reasonably afford to purchase the dwelling unit by means of a mortgage insured under subsection (a) of this section or any other mortgage insurance program under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan initially does not exceed the percentage of the initial appraised value of the property specified in section 1709(b) of this title as of the date the mortgage or loan is accepted for insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan thereafter (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) will not at any time be scheduled to exceed 97 per centum, or, if the mortgagor is a veteran, such higher percentage as is provided under section 1709(b)(2) of this title for veterans, of the projected value of the property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the principal obligation of the mortgage thereafter will not exceed 113 per centum of the initial appraised value of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Mortgage insurance under this subsection shall be limited to mortgages executed by mortgagors who, as determined by the Secretary, have not owned dwelling units within the preceding three years. For the purpose of this subsection, the projected value of the property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the initial appraised value of the property at a rate not in excess of 21/2 per centum per annum. The number of mortgages which are insured in accordance with this subsection in any fiscal year may not exceed (A) that number of mortgages the aggregate initial principal obligation of which equals 10 per centum of the aggregate amount of the initial principal obligation of all mortgages secured by properties improved by one- to four-<!-- PDFPage:682 -->family residences which are insured under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year, or (B) 50,000 mortgages, whichever is greater. No loan or mortgage may be insured under this subsection after February 5, 1988, except pursuant to a commitment to insure entered into on or before February 5, 1988.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mortgages with monthly adjustments based on selected price index; priority; regulations; number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage or loan that meets the requirements of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and that has provisions permitting adjustment of monthly payments and outstanding principal according to changes or percentages of changes in a selected price index if the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan initially does not exceed the percentage of the initial appraised value of the property specified in section 1709(b) of this title as of the date the mortgage or loan is accepted for insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the monthly payments and principal obligation of the mortgage or loan thereafter will not at any time be increased at a rate greater than the percentage change in the price index stipulated in the initial mortgage or loan contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall give a priority to mortgages executed by mortgagors who, as determined by the Secretary, have not owned dwelling units within the preceding 3 years. The Secretary shall, not later than March 31, 1984, prescribe regulations establishing guidelines governing mortgages and loans described in this subsection and shall, to the extent practicable, conduct a demonstration program to insure mortgages and loans in accordance with this subsection during fiscal years 1984 and 1985. The aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured under this subsection and section 1715z&ndash;17 of this title in any fiscal year may not exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Multifamily housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may insure, under any provision of this subchapter relating to multifamily housing projects, mortgages and loans with provisions of varying rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in project income, to the extent the Secretary determines such mortgages or loans (A) have promise for expanding housing opportunities or meet special needs; (B) can be developed to include any safeguards for mortgagors, tenants, or purchasers that may be necessary to offset special risks of such mortgages; and (C) have a potential for acceptance in the private market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the principal obligation of a mortgage or loan insured pursuant to this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may not exceed initially the percentage of the initial appraised value or replacement cost of the property involved that is required by the provision of this subchapter under which such property is insured; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) thereafter (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) may not at any time be scheduled to exceed 100 percent of the projected value of such property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the projected value of a property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the initial appraised value of such property at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Inapplicability of State constitution, etc., provision limiting interest or requiring minimum amortization of principal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage or loan insured pursuant to this section which contains or sets forth any graduated mortgage provisions (including but not limited to provisions for adding deferred interest to principal) which are authorized under this section and applicable regulations, or which have been insured on the basis of their being so authorized, shall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, or rule or public policy (1) limiting the amount of interest which may be charged, taken, received, or reserved, or the manner of calculating such interest (including but not limited to prohibitions against the charging of interest on interest), if such constitution, statute, court decree, common law, or rule would not apply to the mortgage or loan in the absence of such graduated payment mortgage provisions, or (2) requiring a minimum amortization of principal under the mortgage or loan.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) One- to four-family residence; eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, subject to such special conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, may insure under any provision of this subchapter that authorizes such insurance, a mortgage covering a property upon which there is located a one- to four-family residence, without regard to any limitation in this chapter relating to marketability of title or any other limitation in this chapter that the Secretary determines is contrary to promoting the availability of such insurance on Indian reservations if the mortgage (1) is executed by an Indian tribe and the property is located on trust or otherwise restricted land; or (2) is executed by a member of an Indian tribe who will use the property as a principal residence and the property is on trust or otherwise restricted land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction advances; percentage limitation on amount of principal obligation; pledge of income from tribal resources or assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, with respect to mortgages covering a property upon which there is located a one- to four-family residence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may insure and make commitments to insure under this subchapter pursuant to this section advances made during construction where the Secretary determines that the proposed construction is otherwise acceptable and meets an applicable tribal or national model building code, and that no feasible financing alternative is available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the applicable percentage limitation on the amount of the principal obligation of a mortgage based on the appraised value or replacement cost, as appropriate, of a one- to four-family owner-occupied residence contained in this subchapter shall apply in the case of all mortgages insured pursuant to this section without regard to whether the residences are owner-occupied where the residences are owned by the tribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) the Secretary may require an Indian tribe, only as a condition of insurance made under this subchapter pursuant to this section, to pledge income from tribal resources or income from tribal assets not subject to a restriction by the Secretary of the Interior or pledge grants under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] or any other Federal grant program administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to be used to reimburse the Secretary for any mortgage insurance claims paid in connection with residences insured pursuant to this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an individual Indian mortgagor, the Secretary may require a pledge of his or her share of distributed income from tribal resources or income from tribal assets, excluding any Federal grants received by the tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lack of tribal or trust fund income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not refuse to insure a mortgage under this section to an individual home purchaser because there is no distributed tribal or trust fund income attributable to that purchaser.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Availability of tribal eviction procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before making any commitment to insure a mortgage under this section with respect to property located on trust or otherwise restricted land, the Secretary shall require a showing by the tribe that it has adopted eviction procedures to be used in the event of a default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assumption of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage insured under this section may be assumed, subject to credit approval by the lender and the consent of the tribe to an assumption of the existing lease or the grant of a new lease, without an adjustment of the interest rate. Any other sale of a property subject to a mortgage insured under this section may be made only if a new lease is granted, except that a sale following a foreclosure may be accompanied by an assumption of the lease with the consent of the tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Insurance of mortgage as obligation of General Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the insurance of a mortgage using the <!-- PDFPage:686 -->authority contained in this section shall be the obligation of the General Insurance Fund established in section 1735c of this title. The mortgagee shall be eligible to receive the benefits of insurance as provided in section 1710 of this title with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section, except that (1) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund; and (2) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to the section under which the mortgage is insured.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Availability of status and payment history of loans; entitlement to benefit of insurance; reinstatement of loan upon cure of default; garnishment proceedings; foreclosure proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall make information regarding the status and payment history of loans insured under this section available to local credit bureaus and prospective creditors. Prior to accepting assignment of a mortgage, the Secretary shall require mortgagees to submit documentation that mortgagors have been counseled in a face-to-face interview, informed of the provisions of this subsection or other available assistance, and provided with the names and addresses of officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to whom further communications shall be addressed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the requirement for conveyance of title under section 1710 of this title, a mortgagee under this section shall be entitled to receive the benefit of insurance under this section in the case of a mortgage which is more than 90 days in default upon conveyance of the lease agreement and the mortgage documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that any default is cured, the Secretary shall seek to reinstate the loan with the mortgagee or another mortgagee. For purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary may provide appropriate financial incentives to reinstate the loan commensurate with sound management of the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary determines that a mortgagor is not making a good-faith effort to cure a default, and that trust fund or tribal income is available under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall commence proceedings for the garnishment of the mortgagor's distributed share of tribal or trust fund income in order to collect loan payments that are past due. Proceedings under this paragraph may be instituted in a tribal court, court of competent jurisdiction designated by the tribe, or Federal district court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Secretary determines such action is necessary to protect the General Insurance Fund from undue loss, the Secretary may initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to any mortgage acquired under this subsection. Such proceeding may take place in a tribal court, a court of competent jurisdiction, or Federal district court. Any such court shall have jurisdiction to convey to the Secretary the remaining life of a lease on the real property and to order eviction of the delinquent mortgagor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Premium charge for insurance; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the administration of this section, the Secretary shall establish a premium charge for insurance that will be sufficient to cover the full costs of the mortgage insurance program under this section, except that such charge may not exceed 3 percent per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage outstanding at any time. Not later than September 30, 1984, the Secretary shall determine and report to the Congress on the feasibility of eliminating any excess amount of the premium under this section over the premium under section 1709 of this title. In the event such premiums are not sufficient to cover the full costs of the mortgage insurance program under this section, the Secretary shall make recommendations to the Congress about changes to the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Indian tribe&rdquo; and &ldquo;trust or otherwise restricted land&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;Indian tribe&rdquo; means any Indian or Alaska native tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians or Alaska natives recognized as eligible for the services provided to Indians or Alaska natives by the Secretary of the Interior because of its status as such an entity, or that was an eligible recipient under chapter 67 of title 31, prior to the repeal of such chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;trust or otherwise restricted land&rdquo; means (A) that area of land, as defined by the Secretary of the Interior, over which an Indian tribe is recognized by the United States as having governmental jurisdiction; (B) land held in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation; or (C) land acquired by Alaska natives under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] or any other land acquired by Alaska natives pursuant to statute by virtue of their unique status as Alaska natives.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide access to sources of private financing to Indian families, Indian housing authorities, and Indian tribes, who otherwise could not acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of Indian lands or as a result of a lack of access to private financial markets, the Secretary may guarantee not to exceed 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest due on any loan eligible under subsection (b) of this section made to an Indian family, Indian housing authority, or Indian tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans guaranteed pursuant to this section shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible borrowers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loans shall be made only to borrowers who are Indian families, Indian housing authorities, or Indian tribes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall be used to construct, acquire, or rehabilitate 1- to 4-family dwellings that are standard housing and are located on trust land or land located in an Indian or Alaska Native area that is under the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe for which an Indian housing plan has been submitted and approved pursuant to sections 102 and 103 of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 [25 U.S.C. 4112, 4113] that provides for the use of loan guarantees under this section to provide affordable homeownership housing in such areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan may be secured by any collateral authorized under existing Federal law or applicable State or tribal law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Lenders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall be made only by a lender approved by and meeting qualifications established by the Secretary, except that loans otherwise insured or guaranteed by an agency of the Federal Government or made by an organization of Indians from amounts borrowed from the United States shall not be eligible for guarantee under this section. The following lenders are deemed to be approved under this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Any mortgagee approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for participation in the single family mortgage insurance program under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any lender whose housing loans under chapter 37 of title 38 are automatically guaranteed pursuant to section 1802(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-13a_1_target" name="1715z-13a_1">1</a></sup> of such title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Any lender approved by the Secretary of Agriculture to make guaranteed loans for single family housing under the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any other lender that is supervised, approved, regulated, or insured by any agency of the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be made for a term not exceeding 30 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bear interest (exclusive of the guarantee fee under section 404&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-13a_2_target" name="1715z-13a_2">2</a></sup> and service charges, if any) at a rate agreed upon by the borrower and the lender and determined by the Secretary to be reasonable, which may not exceed the rate generally charged in the area (as determined by the Secretary) for home mortgage loans not guaranteed or insured by any agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) involve a principal obligation not exceeding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 97.75 percent of the appraised value of the property as of the date the loan is accepted for guarantee (or 98.75 percent if the value of the property is $50,000 or less); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount approved by the Secretary under this section; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) involve a payment on account of the property (i) in cash or its equivalent, or (ii) through the value of any improvements to the property made through the skilled or unskilled labor of the borrower, as the Secretary shall provide.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certificate of guarantee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the Secretary approves any loan for guarantee under this section, the lender shall submit the application for the loan to the Secretary for examination. If the Secretary approves the loan for guarantee, the Secretary shall issue a certificate under this paragraph as evidence of the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard for approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a loan for guarantee under this section and issue a certificate <!-- PDFPage:688 -->under this paragraph only if the Secretary determines there is a reasonable prospect of repayment of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certificate of guarantee issued under this paragraph by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guarantee under the provisions of this section and the amount of such guarantee. Such evidence shall be incontestable in the hands of the bearer and the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts agreed to be paid by the Secretary as security for such obligations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Fraud and misrepresentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection may not be construed to preclude the Secretary from establishing defenses against the original lender based on fraud or material misrepresentation or to bar the Secretary from establishing by regulations in effect on the date of issuance or disbursement, whichever is earlier, partial defenses to the amount payable on the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall fix and collect a guarantee fee for the guarantee of loans under this section, which may not exceed the amount equal to 1 percent of the principal obligation of the loan. The fee shall be paid by the lender at time of issuance of the guarantee and shall be adequate, in the determination of the Secretary, to cover expenses and probable losses. The Secretary shall deposit any fees collected under this subsection in the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Fund established under subsection (i) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liability under guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The liability under a guarantee provided under this section shall decrease or increase on a pro rata basis according to any decrease or increase in the amount of the unpaid obligation under the provisions of the loan agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer and assumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any loan guaranteed under this section, including the security given for the loan, may be sold or assigned by the lender to any financial institution subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the Federal Government or of any State or the District of Columbia.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disqualification of lenders and civil money penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any lender or holder of a guarantee certificate under subsection (c) of this section has failed to maintain adequate accounting records, to adequately service loans guaranteed under this section, to exercise proper credit or underwriting judgment, or has engaged in practices otherwise detrimental to the interest of a borrower or the United States, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) refuse, either temporarily or permanently, to guarantee any further loans made by such lender or holder;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bar such lender or holder from acquiring additional loans guaranteed under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) require that such lender or holder assume not less than 10 percent of any loss on further loans made or held by the lender or holder that are guaranteed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil money penalties for intentional violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any lender or holder of a guarantee certificate under subsection (c) of this section has intentionally failed to maintain adequate accounting records, to adequately service loans guaranteed under this section, or to exercise proper credit or underwriting judgment, the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty on such lender or holder in the manner and amount provided under section 536 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1735f&ndash;14] with respect to mortgagees and lenders under such Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment on loans made in good faith</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary may not refuse to pay pursuant to a valid guarantee on loans of a lender or holder barred under this subsection if the loans were previously made in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Payment under guarantee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Lender options</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the event of default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall provide written notice of the default to the Secretary. Upon providing such notice, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall be entitled to payment under the guarantee (subject to the provisions of this section) and may proceed to obtain payment in one of the following manners:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The holder of the certificate may initiate foreclosure proceedings (after providing written notice of such action to the Secretary) and upon a final order by the court authorizing foreclosure and submission to the Secretary of a claim for payment under the guarantee, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the certificate the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined pursuant to subsection (e) of this section) plus reasonable fees and expenses as approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee and the lender holder shall assign the obligation and security to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) No foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Without seeking foreclosure (or in any case in which a foreclosure proceeding initiated under clause (i) continues for a period in excess of 1 year), the holder of the guarantee may submit to the Secretary a request to assign the obligation and security interest to the Secretary in return for payment of the claim under the guarantee. The Secretary may accept assignment of the loan if the Secretary determines that <!-- PDFPage:689 -->the assignment is in the best interests of the United States. Upon assignment, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the guarantee the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined under subsection (e) of this section). The Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee and the holder shall assign the obligation and security to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before any payment under a guarantee is made under subparagraph (A), the holder of the guarantee shall exhaust all reasonable possibilities of collection. Upon payment, in whole or in part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States. The Secretary shall then take such action to collect as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations on liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the event of a default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section involving a security interest in restricted Indian land, the mortgagee or the Secretary shall only pursue liquidation after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the tribe, or the Indian housing authority serving the tribe or tribes. If the mortgagee or the Secretary subsequently proceeds to liquidate the account, the mortgagee or the Secretary shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the property except to one of the entities described in the preceding sentence.</p>

Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall correspond to a specified national interest rate index approved in regulations by the Secretary, information on which is readily accessible to mortgagors from generally available published sources. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall (1) be made on an annual basis; (2) be limited, with respect to any single interest rate increase, to no more than 1 percent on the outstanding loan balance; and (3) be limited to a maximum increase of 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate over the term of the mortgage.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of mortgagee's share of net appreciated value; term of mortgage; repayment; &ldquo;net appreciated value&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgagee's share of a property's net appreciated value shall be payable upon maturity or upon payment in full of the loan or sale or transfer (as defined by the Secretary) of the property, whichever occurs first. The term of the mortgage shall not be less than 15 years, and shall be repayable in equal monthly installments of principal and fixed interest during the mortgage term in an amount which would be sufficient to retire a debt with the same principal and fixed interest rate over a period not exceeding 30 years. In the case of a mortgage which will not be completely amortized during the mortgage term, the principal obligation of the mortgage may not exceed 85 percent of the estimated value of the property or project. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;net appreciated value&rdquo; means the amount by which the sales price of the property (less the mortgagor's selling costs) exceeds the actual project cost after completion, as approved by the Secretary. If there has been no sale or transfer at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable, the sales price for purposes of this section shall be determined by means of an appraisal conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the Secretary and provided for in the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Entitlement of mortgagee upon default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of insurance in accordance with section 1713 of this title, but such insurance benefits shall not include the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Maximum percentage of net appreciated value; disclosure requirements</h4>

The Secretary shall also establish disclosure requirements applicable to mortgagees making mortgage loans pursuant to this section, to assure that mortgagors are informed of the characteristics of such mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Inapplicability of State constitution, statute, etc., limiting or prohibiting increases in outstanding loan balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Mortgages insured pursuant to this section which contain provisions for sharing appreciation or which otherwise require or permit increases in the outstanding loan balance which are authorized under this section or under applicable regulations shall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, rule, or public policy limiting or prohibiting increases in the outstanding loan balance after execution of the mortgage.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purchase and sale of insured and conventional mortgages; transactions in loans and advances of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purposes set forth in section 1716 of this title and subject to the limitations and restrictions of this subchapter, each of the bodies corporate named in subsection (a)(2) of this section is authorized pursuant to commitments or otherwise, to purchase, service, sell, or otherwise deal in any mortgages which are insured under this chapter or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.], or which are insured or guaranteed under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 or chapter 37 of title 38; and to purchase, service, sell, or otherwise deal in any loans made or guaranteed under part B of title VI of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 291j&ndash;1 et seq.]; and the corporation is authorized to lend on the security of any such mortgages and to purchase, sell, or otherwise deal in any securities guaranteed by the Association under section 1721(g) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That (1) the Association may not purchase any mortgage at a price exceeding 100 per centum of the unpaid principal amount thereof at the time of purchase, with adjustments for interest and any comparable items; (2) the Association may not purchase any mortgage, except a mortgage insured under title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.], if it is offered by, or covers property held by, a State, territorial, or municipal instrumentality; and (3) the Association may not purchase any mortgage under section 1720&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1717_2_target" name="1717_2">2</a></sup> of this title, except a mortgage insured under section 1715k of this title or subchapter VIII of this chapter or section 1709(k) of this title, or under subchapter IX&ndash;A&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1717_2_target" name="1717_2">2</a></sup> of this chapter with respect to a new community approved under section 1749cc&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1717_2_target" name="1717_2">2</a></sup> of this title, or insured under section 1715e of this title and covering property located in an urban renewal area, or a mortgage covering property located in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii, if the original principal obligation thereof exceeds or exceeded $55,000 in the case of property upon which is located a dwelling designed principally for a one-family residence; or $60,000 in the case of a two- or three-family residence; or $68,750 in the case of a four-family residence; or, in the case of a property containing more than four dwelling units, $38,000 per dwelling unit (or such higher amount not in excess of $45,000 per dwelling unit as the Secretary may by regulation specify in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require) for that part of the property attributable to dwelling use. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (3) of the preceding sentence, the Association may purchase a mortgage under section 1720&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1717_2_target" name="1717_2">2</a></sup> of this title with an original principal obligation which exceeds the otherwise applicable maximum amount per dwelling unit if the mortgage is insured under section 1713(c)(3), 1715e(b)(2), 1715k(d)(3)(B)(iii), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3)(ii), 1715<em>l</em>(d)(4)(ii), 1715v(c)(2), 1715y(e)(3), or 1715z&ndash;1 of this title. For the purposes of this subchapter, the terms &ldquo;mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;home mortgages&rdquo; shall be inclusive of any mortgages or other loans insured under any of the provisions of this chapter or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes set forth in section 1716(a) of this title, the corporation is authorized, pursuant to commitments or otherwise, to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, or otherwise deal in mortgages which are not insured or guaranteed as provided in paragraph (1) (such mortgages referred to hereinafter as &ldquo;conventional mortgages&rdquo;). No such purchase of a conventional mortgage secured by a property comprising one- to four-family dwelling units <!-- PDFPage:703 -->shall be made if the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage at the time of purchase exceeds 80 per centum of the value of the property securing the mortgage, unless (A) the seller retains a participation of not less than 10 per centum in the mortgage; (B) for such period and under such circumstances as the corporation may require, the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage upon demand of the corporation in the event that the mortgage is in default; or (C) that portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage which is in excess of such 80 per centum is guaranteed or insured by a qualified insurer as determined by the corporation. The corporation shall not issue a commitment to purchase a conventional mortgage prior to the date the mortgage is originated, if such mortgage is eligible for purchase under the preceding sentence only by reason of compliance with the requirements of clause (A) of such sentence. The corporation may purchase a conventional mortgage which was originated more than one year prior to the purchase date only if the seller is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, or any other seller currently engaged in mortgage lending or investing activities. For the purpose of this section, the term &ldquo;conventional mortgages&rdquo; shall include a mortgage, lien, or other security interest on the stock or membership certificate issued to a tenant-stockholder or resident-member of a cooperative housing corporation, as defined in section 216 of title 26, and on the proprietary lease, occupancy agreement, or right of tenancy in the dwelling unit of the tenant-stockholder or resident-member in such cooperative housing corporation. The corporation shall establish limitations governing the maximum original principal obligation of conventional mortgages that are purchased by it; in any case in which the corporation purchases a participation interest in such a mortgage, the limitation shall be calculated with respect to the total original principal obligation of the mortgage and not merely with respect to the interest purchased by the corporation. Such limitations shall not exceed $93,750 for a mortgage secured by a single-family residence, $120,000 for a mortgage secured by a two-family residence, $145,000 for a mortgage secured by a three-family residence, and $180,000 for a mortgage secured by a four-family residence, except that such maximum limitations shall be adjusted effective January 1 of each year beginning with 1981. Each such adjustment shall be made by adding to each such amount (as it may have been previously adjusted) a percentage thereof equal to the percentage increase during the twelve-month period ending with the previous October in the national average one-family house price in the monthly survey of all major lenders conducted by the Federal Housing Finance Board. With respect to mortgages secured by property comprising five or more family dwelling units, such limitations shall not exceed 125 per centum of the dollar amounts set forth in section 1713(c)(3) of this title, except that such limitations may be increased by the corporation (taking into account construction costs) to not to exceed 240 per centum of such dollar amounts in any geographical area for which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines under such section that cost levels require any increase in the dollar amount limitations under such section. The foregoing limitations may be increased by not to exceed 50 per centum with respect to properties located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in loans or advances of credit for the purchase and installation of home improvements, including energy conserving improvements or solar energy systems described in the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title and residential energy conservation measures as described in section 210(11) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 8211(11)]&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1717_3_target" name="1717_3">3</a></sup> and financed by a public utility in accordance with the requirements of title II of such Act [42 U.S.C. 8211 et seq.]. To be eligible for purchase, any such loan or advance of credit (other than a loan or advance made with respect to energy conserving improvements or solar energy systems or residential energy conservation measures) not insured under subchapter I of this chapter shall be secured by a lien against the property to be improved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in loans or advances of credit secured by mortgages or other liens against manufactured homes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in (i) conventional mortgages that are secured by a subordinate lien against a one- to four-family residence that is the principal residence of the mortgagor; and (ii) conventional mortgages that are secured by a subordinate lien against a property comprising five or more family dwelling units. If the corporation, pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4), shall have purchased, serviced, sold, or otherwise dealt with any other outstanding mortgage secured by the same residence, the aggregate original amount of such other mortgage and the mortgage authorized to be purchased, serviced, sold, or otherwise dealt with under this paragraph shall not exceed the applicable limitation determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation shall establish limitations governing the maximum original principal obligation of conventional mortgages described in subparagraph (A). In any case in which the corporation purchases a participation interest in such a mortgage, the limitation shall be calculated with respect to the total original principal obligation of such mortgage described in subparagraph (A) and not merely with respect to the interest purchased by the corporation. Such limitations shall not exceed (i) with respect to mortgages described in subparagraph (A)(i), 50 per centum of the single-family residence mortgage limitation determined under paragraph (2); and (ii) with respect to mortgages described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the applicable limitation determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) No subordinate mortgage against a one- to four-family residence shall be purchased by the <!-- PDFPage:704 -->corporation if the total outstanding indebtedness secured by the property as a result of such mortgage exceeds 80 per centum of the value of such property unless (i) that portion of such total outstanding indebtedness that exceeds such 80 per centum is guaranteed or insured by a qualified insurer as determined by the corporation; (ii) the seller retains a participation of not less than 10 per centum in the mortgage; or (iii) for such period and under such circumstances as the corporation may require, the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage upon demand of the corporation in the event that the mortgage is in default. The corporation shall not issue a commitment to purchase a subordinate mortgage prior to the date the mortgage is originated, if such mortgage is eligible for purchase under the preceding sentence only by reason of compliance with the requirements of clause (ii) of such sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The corporation may not implement any new program (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title) before obtaining the approval of the Secretary under section 4542 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administration of trusts; obligations of departments and agencies of the United States; exemption of interest income from taxation; authorization of appropriations for differential reimbursements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of any other law, the Association is authorized under section 1721 of this title to create, accept, execute, and otherwise administer in all respects such trusts, receiverships, conservatorships, liquidating or other agencies, or other fiduciary and representative undertakings and activities, hereinafter in this subsection called &ldquo;trusts&rdquo;, as might be appropriate for financing purposes; and in relation thereto the Association may acquire, hold and manage, dispose of, and otherwise deal in any mortgages or other types of obligations in which any department or agency of the United States listed in paragraph (2) of this subsection may have a financial interest. The Association may join in any such undertakings and activities, hereinafter in this subsection called &ldquo;trusts&rdquo;; notwithstanding that it is also serving in a fiduciary or representative capacity; and is authorized to guarantee any participations or other instruments, whether evidence of property rights or debt, issued for such financing purposes. Participations or other instruments issued by the Association pursuant to this subsection shall to the same extent as securities which are direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States be deemed to be exempt securities within the meaning of laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amounts of any mortgages and their obligations acquired by the Association under section 1721 of this title, pursuant to this subsection, shall not be included in the total amounts set forth in section 1721(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to the limitations provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, one or more trusts may be established as provided in this subsection by each of the following departments or agencies:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The head of each such department or agency, hereinafter in this subsection called the &ldquo;trustor,&rdquo; is authorized to set aside a part or all of any obligations held by the trustor and subject them to a trust or trusts and, incident thereto, shall guarantee to the trustee timely payment thereof. The trust instrument may provide for the issuance and sale of beneficial interests or participations, by the trustee, in such obligations or in the right to receive interest and principal collections therefrom; and may provide for the substitution or withdrawal of such obligations, or for the substitution of cash for obligations. The trust or trusts shall be exempt from all taxation. The trust instrument may also contain other appropriate provisions in keeping with the purposes of this subsection. The Association shall be named and shall act as trustee of any such trusts and, for the purposes thereof, the title to such obligations shall be deemed to have passed to the Association in trust. The trust instrument shall provide that custody, control, and administration of the obligations shall remain in the trustor subjecting the obligations to the trust, subject to transfer to the trustee in event of default or probable default, as determined by the trustee, in the payment of principal and interest of the beneficial interests or participations. Collections from obligations subject to the trust shall be dealt with as provided in the instrument creating the trust. The trust instrument shall provide that the trustee will promptly pay to the trustor the full net proceeds of any sale of beneficial interests or participations to the extent they are based upon such obligations or collections. Such proceeds shall be dealt with as otherwise provided by law for sales or repayment of such obligations. The effect of both past and future sales of any issue of beneficial interests or participations shall be the same, to the extent of the principal of such issue, as the direct sale with recourse of the obligations subject to the trust. Any trustor creating a trust or trusts hereunder is authorized to purchase, through the facilities of the trustee, outstanding beneficial interests or participations to the extent of the amount of the trustor's responsibility to the trustee on beneficial interests or participations outstanding, and to pay the trustor's proper share of the costs and expenses incurred by the Association as trustee pursuant to the trust instrument.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:705 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) When any trustor guarantees to the trustee the timely payment of obligations the trustor subjects to a trust pursuant to this subsection, and it becomes necessary for such trustor to meet his responsibilities under such guaranty, the trustor is authorized to fulfill such guaranty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Beneficial interests or participations shall not be issued for the account of any trustor in an aggregate principal amount greater than is authorized with respect to such trustor in an appropriation Act. Any such authorization shall remain available only for the fiscal year for which it is granted and for the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Association, as trustee, is authorized to issue and sell beneficial interests or participations under this subsection, notwithstanding that there may be an insufficiency in aggregate receipts from obligations subject to the related trust to provide for the payment by the trustee (on a timely basis out of current receipts or otherwise) of all interest or principal on such interests or participations (after provision for all costs and expenses incurred by the trustee, fairly prorated among trustors). There are authorized to be appropriated without fiscal year limitation such sums as may be necessary to enable any trustor to pay the trustee such insufficiency as the trustee may require on account of outstanding beneficial interests or participations authorized to be issued pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. Such trustor shall make timely payments to the trustee from such appropriations, subject to and in accord with the trust instrument. In the event that the insufficiency required by the trustee is on account of principal maturities of outstanding beneficial interests or participations authorized to be issued pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection, or pursuant hereto, the trustee is authorized to elect to issue additional beneficial interests or participations for refinancing purposes in lieu of requiring any trustor or trustors to make payments to the trustee from appropriated funds or other sources. Each such issue of beneficial interests or participations shall be in an amount determined by the trustee but not in excess of the aggregate amount which the trustee would otherwise require the trustor or trustors to pay from appropriated funds or other sources, and may be issued without regard to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection. All refinancing issues of beneficial interests or participations shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the authority contained in the appropriation Act or Acts under which the beneficial interests or participations were originally issued.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Common stock; preferred stock; transferability of shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation shall have common stock, without par value, which shall be vested with all voting rights, each share being entitled to one vote with rights of cumulative voting at all elections of directors. The corporation may eliminate such rights of cumulative voting by a resolution adopted by its board of directors and approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock voting in person or by proxy at the annual meeting, or other special meeting, at which such resolution is considered. The corporation may have preferred stock on such terms and conditions as the board of directors shall prescribe. The free transferability of the stock at all times to any person, firm, corporation, or other entity shall not be restricted except that, as to the corporation, it shall be transferable only on the books of the corporation. The corporation may issue shares of common stock in return for appropriate payments into capital or capital and surplus.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fees and charges; annual transfer of earnings to general surplus account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may impose charges or fees, which may be regarded as elements of pricing, with the objective that all costs and expenses of the operations of the corporation should be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-supporting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All earnings from the operations of the corporation shall annually be transferred to the general surplus account of the corporation. At any time, funds of the general surplus account may, in the discretion of the board of directors, be transferred to reserves.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Capital distributions from general surplus account; minimum capitalization levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the corporation may make such capital distributions (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title) as may be declared by the board of directors. All capital distributions shall be charged against the general surplus account of the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation may not make any capital distribution that would decrease the total capital of the corporation (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title) to an amount less than the risk-based capital level for the corporation established under section 4611 of this title or that would decrease the core capital of the corporation (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title) to an amount less than the minimum capital level for the corporation established under section 4612 of this title, without prior written approval of the distribution by the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Institutions eligible to purchase stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any institution, including a national bank or State member bank of the Federal Reserve System or any member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, trust company, or other banking organization, organized under any law of the United States, including the laws relating to the District of Columbia, shall be authorized to purchase shares of common stock of the corporation and to hold or dispose of such stock, subject to the provisions of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Special Assistance Funds of Association for Financing Low-Cost Homes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1006 of Pub. L. 89&ndash;754, title X, Nov. 3, 1966, 80 Stat. 1285, provided that the Congress found that the sharp decline in new home construction over the past year threatened to undercut the present high level of prosperity and employment as such declines had in the past; that the substantial reduction which had taken place had its greatest impact on families of modest income who were seeking to achieve the goal of homeownership; that this decline in homebuilding was due primarily to the shortage of mortgage financing on terms which moderate income families could afford; and that national policy objectives in the field of housing and community development were thereby being thwarted. The Congress therefore expressed its intent that the special assistance funds made available to the Federal National Mortgage Association for the financing of new low-cost homes by the Act of September 10, 1966 (Public Law 89&ndash;556) [amending sections 1718, 1719, and 1720 of this title], should be released immediately to halt the continuing decline in the construction of new homes for families of moderate incomes.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1719. Secondary market operations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purchase and sale of mortgages; secondary market operations; advance of funds or origination of loans; settlement or extinguishment of borrower's rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To carry out the purposes set forth in paragraph (a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1719_1_target" name="1719_1">1</a></sup> of section 1716 of this title, the operations of the corporation under this section shall be confined, so far as practicable, to mortgages which are deemed by the corporation to be of such quality, type, and class as to meet, generally, the purchase standards imposed by private institutional mortgage investors. In the interest of assuring sound operation, the prices to be paid by the corporation for mortgages purchased in its secondary market operations under this section, should be established, from time to time, within the range of market prices for the particular class of mortgages involved, as determined by the corporation. The volume of the corporation's purchases and sales, and the establishment of the purchase prices, sale prices, and charges or fees, in its secondary market operations under this section, should be determined by the corporation from time to time, and such determinations should be consistent with the objectives that such purchases and sales should be effected only at such prices and on such terms as will reasonably prevent excessive use of the corporation's facilities, and that the operations of the corporation under this section should be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-supporting. Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the corporation from purchasing, and making commitments to purchase, any mortgage with respect to which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has entered into a contract with the corporation to make interest subsidy payments under section 1715z&ndash;8 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The volume of the corporation's lending activities and the establishment of its loan ratios, interest rates, maturities, and charges or fees, in its secondary market operations under this section, should be determined by the corporation from time to time; and such determinations, in conjunction with determinations made under paragraph (1), should be consistent with the objectives that the lending activities should be conducted on such terms as will reasonably prevent excessive use of the corporation's facilities, and that the operations of the corporation under this section should be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-supporting. The corporation shall not be permitted to use its lending authority (A) to advance funds to a mortgage seller on an interim basis, using mortgage loans as collateral, pending the sale of the mortgages in the secondary market; or (B) to originate mortgage loans. Notwithstanding any Federal, State, or other law to the contrary, the corporation is empowered, in connection with any loan under this section, whether before or after any default, to provide by contract with the borrower for the settlement or extinguishment, upon default, of any redemption, equitable, legal, or other right, title, or interest of the borrower in any mortgage or mortgages that constitute the security for the loan; and with respect to any such loan, in the event of default and pursuant otherwise to the terms of the contract, the mortgages that constitute such security shall become the absolute property of the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Obligations of the Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the corporation is authorized to issue, upon the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and have outstanding at any one time obligations having such maturities and bearing such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the corporation with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to be redeemable at the option of the corporation before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated in such obligations. The corporation shall insert appropriate language in all of its obligations issued under this subsection clearly indicating that such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof other than the corporation. The corporation is authorized to purchase in the open market any of its <!-- PDFPage:713 -->obligations outstanding under this subsection at any time and at any price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purchase of obligations by Treasury; conditions and restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized in the Secretary's discretion to purchase any obligations issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, as now or hereafter in force, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are extended to include such purchases. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this subsection if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of the Secretary's then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this subsection to an amount greater than $2,250,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the making of such purchase. The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as the Secretary shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by the Secretary under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this subsection shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgage-backed securities; issuance; maturities; rates of interest; exempt securities; adequacy of mortgages to permit principal and interest payments; statement in securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide a greater degree of liquidity to the mortgage investment market and an additional means of financing its operations under this section, the corporation is authorized to set aside any mortgages held by it under this section, and, upon approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to issue and sell securities based upon the mortgages so set aside. Securities issued under this subsection may be in the form of debt obligations or trust certificates of beneficial interest, or both. Securities issued under this subsection shall have such maturities and bear such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the corporation with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Securities issued by the corporation under this subsection shall, to the same extent as securities which are direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, be deemed to be exempt securities within the meaning of laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mortgages set aside pursuant to this subsection shall at all times be adequate to enable the corporation to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities issued and sold pursuant to this subsection. The corporation shall insert appropriate language in all of the securities issued under this subsection clearly indicating that such securities, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof other than the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Subordinated or convertible obligations; issuance; maturities; rate of interest; redemption; exempt securities; debt or obligation of United States; purchases in open market</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the corporation is authorized to issue, upon the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, obligations which are subordinated to any or all other obligations of the corporation, including subsequent obligations. The obligations issued under this subsection shall have such maturities and bear such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the corporation with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and may be made redeemable at the option of the corporation before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated in such obligations. Any of such obligations may be made convertible into shares of common stock in such manner, at such price or prices, and at such time or times as may be stipulated therein. Obligations issued by the corporation under this subsection shall, to the same extent as securities which are direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States, be deemed to be exempt securities within the meaning of laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The corporation shall insert appropriate language in all of its obligations issued under this subsection clearly indicating that such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof other than the corporation. The corporation is authorized to purchase in the open market any of its obligations outstanding under this subsection at any time and at any price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on assessment or collection of fee or charge by United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except for fees paid pursuant to section 1723a(g) of this title and assessments pursuant to section 4516 of this title, no fee or charge may be assessed or collected by the United States (including any executive department, agency, or independent establishment of the United States) on or with regard to the purchase, acquisition, sale, pledge, issuance, guarantee, or redemption of any mortgage, asset, obligation, trust certificate of beneficial interest, or other security by the corporation.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of obligations to expedite substitution of private financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section and to assure that, to the maximum extent, and as rapidly as possible, private financing will be substituted for Treasury borrowings otherwise required to carry mortgages held under the aforesaid separate accountability, the Association is authorized to issue, upon the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and have outstanding at any one time obligations having such maturities and bearing such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the Association with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to be redeemable at the option of the Association before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated in such obligations; but in no event shall any such obligations be issued if, at the time of such proposed issuance, and as a consequence thereof, the resulting aggregate amount of its outstanding obligations under this subsection would exceed the amount of the Association's ownership under the aforesaid separate accountability, free from any liens or encumbrances, of cash, mortgages, and obligations of the United States or guaranteed thereby, or obligations, participations, or other instruments which are lawful investments for fiduciary, trust or public <!-- PDFPage:716 -->funds. The proceeds of any private financing effected under this subsection shall be paid to the Secretary of the Treasury in reduction of the indebtedness of the Association to the Secretary of the Treasury under the aforesaid separate accountability. The Association shall insert appropriate language in all of its obligations issued under this subsection clearly indicating that such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof other than the Association. The Association is authorized to purchase in the open market any of its obligations outstanding under this subsection at any time and at any price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cutoff date as controlling purchases; total amount of mortgages and commitments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgage shall be purchased by the Association in its operations under this section except pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of a contract or commitment to purchase the same made prior to the cutoff date provided for in section 1718(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1721_1_target" name="1721_1">1</a></sup> of this title, which contract or commitment became a part of the aforesaid separate accountability, and the total amount of mortgages and commitments held by the Association under this section shall not, in any event, exceed $3,350,000,000: <em>Provided</em>, That such maximum amount shall be progressively reduced by the amount of cash realizations on account of principal of mortgages held under the aforesaid separate accountability and by cancellation of any commitments to purchase mortgages thereunder, as reflected by the books of the Association, with the objective that the entire aforesaid maximum amount shall be eliminated with the orderly liquidation of all mortgages held under the aforesaid separate accountability: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Association from granting such usual and customary increases in the amounts of outstanding commitments (resulting from increased costs or otherwise) as have theretofore been covered by like increases in commitments granted by the agencies of the Federal Government insuring or guaranteeing the mortgages. There shall be excluded from the total amounts set forth in this subsection the amounts of any mortgages which, subsequent to May 31, 1954, are transferred by law to the Association and held under the aforesaid separate accountability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Issuance of obligations sufficient to carry out functions; character; purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Association may issue to the Secretary of the Treasury its obligations in an amount outstanding at any one time sufficient to enable the Association to carry out its functions under this section, such obligations to mature not more than five years from their respective dates of issue, to be redeemable at the option of the Association before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated in such obligations. Each such obligation shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the issuance of the obligation of the Association. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase any obligations of the Association to be issued under this section, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are extended to include any purchases of the Association's obligations hereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Acquisition of mortgages offered by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Association is authorized, under the aforesaid separate accountability, to make commitments to purchase, and to purchase, service, or sell any obligations offered to it by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, or any mortgages covering residential property offered to it by any Federal instrumentality, or the head thereof.

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Association is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of principal of and interest on such trust certificates or other securities as shall (i) be issued by the corporation under section 1719(d) of this title, or by any other issuer approved for the purposes of this subsection by the Association, and (ii) be based on and backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages which are insured under this chapter or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.], or which are insured or guaranteed under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 or chapter 37 of title 38, or which are guaranteed under title XIII of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 300e et seq.];&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1721_3_target" name="1721_3">3</a></sup> or guaranteed under section 1715z&ndash;13a of this title. The Association shall collect from the issuer a reasonable fee for any guaranty under this subsection and shall make such charges as it may deter<!-- PDFPage:717 -->mine to be reasonable for the analysis of any trust or other security arrangement proposed by the issuer. In the event the issuer is unable to make any payment of principal of or interest on any security guaranteed under this subsection, the Association shall make such payment as and when due in cash, and thereupon shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment. In any case in which (I) Federal law requires the reduction of the interest rate on any mortgage backing a security guaranteed under this subsection, (II) the mortgagor under the mortgage is a person in the military service, and (III) the issuer of such security fails to receive from the mortgagor the full amount of interest payment due, the Association may make payments of interest on the security in amounts not exceeding the difference between the amount payable under the interest rate on the mortgage and the amount of interest actually paid by the mortgagor. The Association is hereby empowered, in connection with any guaranty under this subsection, whether before or after any default, to provide by contract with the issuer for the extinguishment, upon default by the issuer, of any redemption, equitable, legal, or other right, title, or interest of the issuer in any mortgage or mortgages constituting the trust or pool against which the guaranteed securities are issued; and with respect to any issue of guaranteed securities, in the event of default and pursuant otherwise to the terms of the contract, the mortgages that constitute such trust or pool shall become the absolute property of the Association subject only to the unsatisfied rights of the holders of the securities based on and backed by such trust or pool. No State or local law, and no Federal law (except Federal law enacted expressly in limitation of this subsection after October 8, 1980), shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Association of (A) its power to contract with the issuer on the terms stated in the preceding sentence, (B) its rights to enforce any such contract with the issuer, or (C) its ownership rights, as provided in the preceding sentence, in the mortgages constituting the trust or pool against which the guaranteed securities are issued. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guaranty under this subsection. There shall be excluded from the total amounts set forth in subsection (c) of this section the amounts of any mortgages acquired by the Association as a result of its operations under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject only to the absence of qualified requests for guarantees, to the authority provided in this subsection, and to the extent of or in such amounts as any funding limitation approved in appropriation Acts, the Association shall enter into commitments to issue guarantees under this subsection in an aggregate amount of $110,000,000,000 during fiscal year 1996. There are authorized to be appropriated to cover the costs (as such term is defined in section 661a of title 2) of guarantees issued under this chapter by the Association such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) No fee or charge in excess of 6 basis points may be assessed or collected by the United States (including any executive department, agency, or independent establishment of the United States) on or with regard to any guaranty of the timely payment of principal or interest on securities or notes based on or backed by mortgages that are secured by 1- to 4-family dwellings and (i) insured by the Federal Housing Administration under subchapter II of this chapter; or (ii) insured or guaranteed under the Serviceman's Readjustment Act of 1944, chapter 37 of title 38, or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The fees charged for the guaranty of securities or on notes based on or backed by mortgages not referred to in subparagraph (A), as authorized by other provisions of law, shall be set by the Association at a level not more than necessary to create reserves sufficient to meet anticipated claims based upon actuarial analysis, and for no other purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Fees or charges for the issuance of commitments or miscellaneous administrative fees of the Association shall not be on a competitive auction basis and shall remain at the level set for such fees or charges as of September 1, 1985, except that such fees or charges may be increased if reasonably related to the cost of administering the program, and for no other purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Not less than 90 days before increasing any fee or charge under subparagraph (B) or (C), the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a certification that such increase is solely for the purpose specified in such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) through (D), fees charged for the guarantee of, or commitment to guarantee, multiclass securities backed by a trust or pool of securities or notes guaranteed by the Association under this subsection, and other related fees shall be charged by the Association in an amount the Association deems appropriate. The Association shall take such action as may be necessary to reasonably assure that such portion of the benefit, resulting from the Association's multiclass securities program, as the Association determines is appropriate accrues to mortgagors who execute eligible mortgages after August 10, 1993.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Association shall provide for the initial implementation of the program for which fees are charged under the first sentence of clause (i) by notice published in the Federal Register. The notice shall be effective upon publication and shall provide an opportunity for public comment. Not later than 12 months after publication of the notice, the Association shall issue regulations for such program based on the notice, comments received, and the experience of the Association in carrying out the program during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Association shall consult with persons or entities in such manner as the Association deems appropriate to ensure the efficient commencement and operation of the multiclass securities program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) No State or local law, and no Federal law (except Federal law enacted expressly in limitation of this clause after August 10, 1993) shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Association of its power to contract with persons or entities, and its rights to enforce such contracts, for the <!-- PDFPage:718 -->purpose of ensuring the efficient commencement and continued operation of the multiclass securities program.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Violations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall provide for the Secretary to make the determination to impose the penalty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall provide for the imposition of a penalty only after an issuer or a custodian has been given notice of, and opportunity for, a hearing on the record; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may provide for review by the Secretary of any determination or order, or interlocutory ruling, arising from a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of a notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of a penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Intent of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that it has been its intent since the enactment of this chapter that housing built with the aid of mortgages insured under this chapter is to be used principally for residential use; and that this intent excludes the use of such housing for transient or hotel purposes while such insurance on the mortgage remains outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions to prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no new, existing, or rehabilitated multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage is insured under this chapter shall be operated for transient or hotel purposes unless (1) on or before May 28, 1954, the Secretary has agreed in writing to the rental of all or a portion of the accommodations in the project for transient or hotel purposes (in which case no accommodations in excess of the number so agreed to by the Secretary shall be rented on such basis), or (2) the project covered by the insured mortgage is located in an area which the Secretary determines to be a resort area, and the Secretary finds that prior to May 28, 1954, a portion of the accommodations in the project had been made available for rent for transient or hotel purposes (in which case no accommodations in excess of the number which had been made available for such use shall be rented on such basis).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification as to use as requisite for insurance; exceptions to prohibition against insuring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no mortgage with respect to multifamily housing shall be insured under this chapter (except pursuant to a commitment to insure issued prior to August 2, 1954), and (except as to housing coming within the provisions of clause <!-- PDFPage:733 -->(1) or clause (2) of subsection (b) of this section) no mortgage with respect to multifamily housing shall be insured for an additional term, unless (1) the mortgagor certifies under oath that while such insurance remains outstanding he will not rent, or permit the rental of, such housing or any part thereof for transient or hotel purposes, and (2) the Secretary has entered into such contract with, or purchased such stock of, the mortgagor as the Secretary deems necessary to enable him to prevent or terminate any use of such property or project for transient or hotel purposes while the mortgage insurance remains outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this section by all appropriate means at his disposal, as to all existing multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage was insured under this chapter prior to August 2, 1954, as well as to all multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage is hereafter insured under this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That no criminal penalty shall, by reason of enactment of this section, be applicable to the rental or operation of any such existing multifamily housing in violation of any provision of subsection (b) of this section at any time prior to August 2, 1954.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, (1) the term &ldquo;rental for transient or hotel purposes&rdquo; shall have such meaning as prescribed by the Secretary but rental for any period less than thirty days shall in any event constitute rental for such purposes, and (2) the term &ldquo;multifamily housing&rdquo; shall mean (i) a property held by a mortgagor upon which there are located five or more single family dwellings, or upon which there is located a two-, three-, or four-family dwelling, or (ii) a property or project covered by mortgage insured or to be insured under section 1713 of this title, under section 1715e of this title with respect to any property or project of a corporation or trust of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) thereof, under section 1715k of this title if the mortgage is within the provisions of paragraph (3) (B) of subsection (d) thereof, under section 1715<em>l</em> of this title if the mortgage is within the provisions of paragraph (3) of subsection (d) thereof, under section 1743, 1748b, or 1750g of this title, or (iii) a project with respect to which an insurance contract pursuant to subchapter VII of this chapter is outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Investigation after notice of violation; cease order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Promptly after receipt of written notice that any portion of any building is being rented or operated in violation of any provision of this section or of any rule or regulation lawfully issued thereunder, the Secretary shall investigate the existence of the facts alleged in the written notice and shall order such violation, if found to exist, to cease forthwith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prosecution by Attorney General for continued violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If such violation does not cease in accordance with such order, the Secretary shall forward the complaint to the Attorney General of the United States for prosecution of such civil or criminal action, if any, which the Attorney General may find to be involved in such violation.</p>

The Secretary shall be responsible for determining the comparability of the State and local codes to such model codes and for selecting for compliance purposes an appropriate nationally recognized model building code where no such model code has been duly adopted or where the Secretary determines the adopted code is not comparable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;distressed mortgagor&rdquo; means an individual who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was employed by the Federal Government at, or was assigned as a serviceman to, a military base or other Federal installation and whose employment or service at such base or installation was terminated subsequent to November 1, 1964, as the result of the closing (in whole or in part) of such base or installation; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:754 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is the owner-occupant of a dwelling situated at or near such base or installation and upon which there is a mortgage securing a loan which is in default because of the inability of such individual to make payments due under such mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application for, issuance and expiration of certificate of moratorium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any distressed mortgagor, for the purpose of avoiding foreclosure of his mortgage, may apply to the appropriate Federal mortgage agency for a determination that suspension of his obligation to make payments due under such mortgage during a temporary period is necessary in order to avoid such foreclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon receipt of an application made under this subsection by a distressed mortgagor, the Federal mortgage agency shall issue to such mortgagor a certificate of moratorium if it determines, after consultation with the interested mortgagee, that such action is necessary to avoid foreclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Prior to the issuance to any distressed mortgagor of a certificate of moratorium under paragraph (2), the Federal mortgage agency, the mortgagor, and the mortgagee shall enter into a binding agreement under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the mortgagor will be required to make payments to such agency, after the expiration of such certificate, in an aggregate amount equal to the amount paid by such agency on behalf of such mortgagor as provided in subsection (c) of this section, together with interest thereon at a rate not to exceed the rate provided in the mortgage; the manner and time in which such payments shall be made to be determined by the Federal mortgage agency having due regard for the purposes sought to be achieved by this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Federal mortgage agency will be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee to the extent of payments made pursuant to such certificate, which rights, however, shall be subject to the prior right of the mortgagee to receive the full amount payable under the mortgage.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any certificate of moratorium issued under this subsection shall expire on whichever of the following dates is the earliest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) two years from the date on which such certificate was issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) thirty days after the date on which the mortgagor gives notice in writing to the Federal mortgage agency that he is able to resume his obligation to make payments due under his mortgage; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) thirty days after the date on which the Federal mortgage agency determines that the mortgagor to whom such certificate was issued has ceased to be a distressed mortgagor as defined in subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to mortgagee of assumption of mortgagor's obligation by agency; amount of payments; suspension of payments by mortgagor; prohibition against further action to enforce or collect payments; liability of mortgagor upon expiration of certificate; notice of expiration of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever a Federal mortgage agency issues a certificate of moratorium to any distressed mortgagor with respect to any mortgage, it shall transmit to the mortgagee a copy of such certificate, together with a notice stating that, while such certificate is in effect, such agency will assume the obligation of such mortgagor to make payments due under the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payments made by any Federal mortgage agency pursuant to a certificate of moratorium issued under this section with respect to the mortgage of any distressed mortgagor may include, in addition to the payments referred to in paragraph (1), an amount equal to the unpaid payments under such mortgage prior to the issuance of such certificate, plus a reasonable allowance for foreclosure costs actually paid by the mortgagee if a foreclosure action was dismissed as a result of the issuance of a moratorium certificate. Payments by the Federal mortgage agency may also include payments of taxes and insurance premiums on the mortgaged property as deemed necessary when these items are not provided for through payments to a tax and insurance account held by the interested mortgagee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) While any certificate of moratorium issued under this section is in effect with respect to the mortgage of any distressed mortgagor, no further payments due under the mortgage shall be required of such mortgagor, and no action (legal or otherwise) shall be taken or maintained by the mortgagee to enforce or collect such payments. Upon the expiration of such certificate, the mortgagor shall again be liable for the payment of all amounts due under the mortgage in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each Federal mortgage agency shall give prompt notice in writing to the interested mortgagor and mortgagee of the expiration of any certificate of moratorium issued by it under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal mortgage agencies are authorized to issue such individual and joint regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section and to insure the uniform administration thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fund for extending financial assistance to distressed mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be in the Treasury (1) a fund which shall be available to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the purpose of extending financial assistance in behalf of distressed mortgagors as provided in subsection (c) of this section, and for paying administrative expenses incurred in connection with such assistance, and (2) a fund which shall be available to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the same purpose, except administrative expenses. The capital of each such fund shall consist of such sums as may, from time to time, be appropriated thereto, and any sums so appropriated shall remain available until expended. Receipts arising from the programs of assistance under subsection (c) of this section shall be credited to the funds from which such assistance was extended. Moneys in either of such funds not needed for current operations, as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as the case may be, shall be invested in bonds or other obli<!-- PDFPage:755 -->gations of the United States, or paid into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage of housing which now exists and to increase the supply of housing accommodations available to veterans of World War II at prices within their reasonable ability to pay, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure as hereinafter provided any mortgage which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <em>Provided</em>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter shall not exceed $6,150,000,000 except that with the approval of the President such aggregate amount may be increased to not to exceed $6,650,000,000: <em>Provided further</em>, That no mortgage shall be insured under this section after April 30, 1948, except (A) pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before April 30, 1948, or (B) a mortgage given to refinance an existing mortgage insured under this section and which does not exceed the original principal amount and unexpired term of such existing mortgage, and no mortgage shall be insured under section 1743 of this title after March 1, 1950, except (i) pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before March 1, 1950, or (ii) a mortgage given to refinance an existing mortgage insured under section 1743 of this title and which does not exceed the original principal amount and unexpired term of such existing mortgage: <em>Provided further</em>, That no mortgage shall be insured under section 1743 of this title unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for the property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certifications to be filed with the Secretary; and violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500: <em>And provided further</em>, That the Secretary shall, in his discretion, have power to require the availability for rental purposes of properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter, in such instances and for such periods of time as he may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the first proviso of this subsection, mortgages may be insured under sections 1744 and 1746 of this title if the aggregate amounts of principal obligations of mortgages insured under said sections plus the aggregate amount of principal obligations of mortgages insured under section 1745 of this title do not exceed the limitation contained in said section 1745 upon the aggregate amount of principal obligations of mortgages insured pursuant to said section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the second proviso of this subsection, mortgages otherwise eligible for insurance under section 1743 of this title may be hereafter insured thereunder if the application for such insurance was received by the Department of Housing and Urban Development on or before March 1, 1950, and for such purpose the aggregate amount of principal obligations authorized to be insured under section 1743 of this title is increased by not to exceed $500,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the value (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance), except that as to applications re<!-- PDFPage:757 -->ceived by the Secretary on or before March 31, 1948, the mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the necessary current cost (including the land and such initial service charges and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve); of a property, urban, suburban, or rural, upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for residential use for not more than four families in the aggregate, which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction. The principal obligation of such mortgage shall in no event, however, exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $5,400 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) $7,500 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) $9,500 if such dwelling is designed for a three-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) $12,000 if such dwelling is designed for a four-family residence:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em"><em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may, if he finds that at any time or in any particular geographical area it is not feasible, within such limitations of maximum mortgage amounts, to construct dwellings without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, or livability, prescribe by regulation or otherwise higher maximum mortgage amounts not to exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $8,100 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) $12,500 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) $15,750 if such dwelling is designed for a three-family residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) $18,000 if such dwelling is designed for a four-family residence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed twenty-five years from the date of the insurance of the mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as herein provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges; payments; acceptance for insurance; preferences; adjustments and refunds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 11/2 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge and such other charges as the Secretary may require, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this subchapter unless the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk in view of the shortage of housing referred to in this section. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured under this subchapter until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as in his judgment are necessary to secure to veterans of World War II, and their immediate families, and to hardship cases as defined by the Secretary, preference or priority of opportunity to purchase or rent properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conveyance and assignment by mortgagee after foreclosure; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under section 1738 of this title shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property, in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Secretary, or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the <!-- PDFPage:759 -->Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment hereinafter provided, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage and a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure, the amount of all payments which have been made by the mortgagee for taxes, ground rents, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage, special assessments which are noted on the application for insurance or which become liens after the insurance of the mortgage, insurance of the mortgaged property, and any mortgage insurance premiums and by deducting from such total amount any amount received on account of the mortgage after either of such dates, and any amount received as rent or other income from the property, less reasonable expenses incurred in handling the property, after either of such dates: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to mortgages which are foreclosed before there shall have been paid on account of the principal obligation of the mortgage a sum equal to 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage was accepted for insurance, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary, on account of the cost of foreclosure (or of acquiring the property by other means) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings and not in excess of $75; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not in excess of two-thirds of such cost, whichever is the greater: <em>Provided further</em>, That with respect to any debentures issued on or after September 2, 1964, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e) of this section), include in debentures, in addition to amounts otherwise allowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 532 and 536 of the Appendix to title 50 apply and which are insured under section 1738 of this title and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of insurance premiums by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consent to release of mortgagee or property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagor shall not be released from such liability in any case until the Secretary is satisfied that the mortgaged property has been sold to a purchaser satisfactory to the Secretary, and that such purchaser has paid on account of the purchase price, in cash or its equivalent, at least 10 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the value as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Debentures; form and denomination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the value of the mortgage determined as herein provided and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $350, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The debenture issued under this section to any mortgagee shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default, except that debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964, shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the mortgage was accepted for insurance, but not to exceed 3 per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages accepted for insurance under this section on or after May 26, 1942, shall mature ten years after the date there<!-- PDFPage:760 -->of. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages accepted for insurance under this section prior to May 26, 1942, shall mature three years after the 1st day of July following the maturity date of the mortgage on the property in exchange for which the debentures were issued: <em>Provided</em>, That any mortgagee entitled to receive such debentures may elect to receive in lieu thereof debentures which shall mature ten years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, and shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event that the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures issued under this subchapter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certificate of claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, at the time of the conveyance to the Secretary of the property covered by the mortgage, the mortgagor had redeemed the property and paid in full all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. The amount to which the holder of any such certificate shall be entitled shall be determined as provided in subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Division of excess proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, after deducting (in such manner and amount as the Secretary shall determine to be equitable and in accordance with sound accounting practice) the expenses incurred by the Secretary, the net amount realized from any property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and the claims assigned therewith exceed the face value of the debentures issued and the cash paid in exchange for such property plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be paid to the mortgagor of such property: <em>Provided</em>, That on and after September 2, 1964, any excess remaining after payment to the holder of the full amount of the certificate of claim shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized, with the consent of the mortgagee or mortgagor, as the case may be, to effect the settlement of certificates of claim and refunds at any time after the sale or transfer of title to the property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and without awaiting the final liquidation of such property for the purpose of determining the net amount to be realized therefrom: <em>Provided</em>, That the settlement authority created by the Housing Amendments of 1955 shall be terminated with respect to any certificate of claim outstanding as of September 2, 1964.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With the consent of the holder thereof, the Secretary is authorized to settle, without awaiting the final liquidation of the Secretary's interest in the property, any certificate of claim issued pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, with respect to which a settlement had not been effected prior to September 2, 1964, by making payment in cash to the holder thereof of such amount, not exceeding the face amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest increment thereon, as the Secretary may consider appropriate: <em>Provided</em>, That in any case where the certificate of claim is settled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, any amounts realized after September 2, 1964, in the liquidation of the Secretary's interest in the property, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power to deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit, in his discretion, any properties conveyed to him in exchange for debentures and certificates of claim as provided in this subchapter; and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against mortgagors assigned by mortgagees to the Secretary as provided in this subchapter, except that no suit or action shall be commenced by the Secretary against any such mortgagor on account of any claim so as<!-- PDFPage:761 -->signed with respect to mortgages insured under section 1738 of this title unless such suit or action is commenced within six months after the assignment of such claim to the Secretary, or within six months after the last payment was made to the Secretary with respect to the claim so assigned, whichever is later: <em>Provided</em>, That section 5 of title 41 shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyances, deeds of release, assignments, and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Mortgagor's or mortgagee's interest in property or claim conveyed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgagee or mortgagor shall have and no certificate of claim shall be construed to give to any mortgagee or mortgagor, any right or interest in any property conveyed to the Secretary or in any claim assigned to him; nor shall the Secretary owe any duty to any mortgagee or mortgagor with respect to the handling or disposal of any such property or the collection of any such claim.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Additional authorization; advances during construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to mortgages insured under section 1738 of this title, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages as defined in section 1736 of this title (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgaged property shall be held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Preference or priority of opportunity in the occupancy of the mortgaged property for veterans of World War II and their immediate families, and for hardship cases as defined by the Secretary, shall be provided under such regulations and procedures as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to exceed $5,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the necessary current cost of the completed property or project, including the land; the proposed physical improvements; utilities within the boundaries of the property or project; architects&rsquo; fees; taxes and interest accruing during construction; and other miscellaneous charges incidental to construction and approved by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That such mortgage shall not in any event exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the cost of the completed physical improvements on the property or project, exclusive of off-site public utilities and streets, and organization and legal expenses: <em>And provided further</em>, That the principal obligation of the mortgage shall not, in any event, exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the replacement cost of the property or project on the basis of the costs prevailing on December 31, 1947, for properties or projects of comparable quality in the locality where such property or project is to be located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed $8,100 per family unit for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payment within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 41/2 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payments; default; insurance benefits for mortgagee; value of mortgage; foreclosure of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the <!-- PDFPage:763 -->terms of a mortgage insured under this section shall be considered a default under such mortgage, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagors or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transaction. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment provided for in section 1739(c) of this title, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage, and a certificate of claim as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of default, the amount the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default; less the sum of (i) an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the unpaid amount of such principal obligation on the date of default; (ii) any amount received on account of the mortgage after such date; and (iii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property after such date: <em>Provided</em>, That the mortgagee in the event of a default under the mortgage may, at its option and in accordance with regulations of, and in a period to be determined by the Secretary, proceed to foreclose on and obtain possession of or otherwise acquire such property from the mortgagor after default, and receive the benefits of the insurance as herein provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims that may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in this subsection, except that in such event the 1 per centum deduction, set out in (i) hereof, shall not apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certificates of claim; amount</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1744. Insurance of loans for manufacture of houses</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Relief of housing shortage; advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage of housing which now exists and to promote the production of housing for veterans of World War II at moderate prices or rentals within their reasonable ability to pay, through the application of modern industrial processes, the Secretary is authorized to insure loans to finance the manufacture of housing (including advances on such loans) when such loans are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans for the manufacture of houses shall be eligible for insurance under this section if at the time of such insurance, the Secretary determines they meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The manufacturer shall establish that binding purchase contracts have been executed satisfactory to the Secretary providing for the purchase and delivery of the houses to be manufactured, which contracts shall provide for the payment of the purchase price at such time as may be agreed to by the parties thereto, but, in no event, shall the purchase price be payable on a date in excess of thirty days after the date of delivery of such houses, unless not less than 20 per centum of such purchase price is paid on or before the date of delivery and the lender has accepted and discounted or has agreed to accept and discount, pursuant to subsection (i) of this section a promissory note or notes, executed by the purchaser, representing the unpaid portion of such purchase price, in which event such unpaid portion of the purchase price may be payable on a date not in excess of one hundred and eighty days from the date of delivery of such houses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such houses to be manufactured shall meet such requirements of sound quality, durability, livability, and safety as may be prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The borrower shall establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that he has or will have adequate plant facilities, sufficient capital funds, taking into account the loan applied for, and the experience necessary, to achieve the required production schedule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The loan shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the necessary current cost, exclusive of profit, of manufacturing the houses, which are the subject of such purchase contracts assigned to secure the loan, less any sums paid by the purchaser under said purchase contracts prior to the assignment thereof. The loan shall be secured by an assignment of the aforesaid purchase contracts and of all sums payable thereunder on or after the date of such assignment, with the right in the assignee to proceed against such security in case of default as provided in the assignment, which assignment shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the Secretary; and the Secretary may require such other agreements and undertakings to further secure the loan as he may determine, including the right, in case of default or at any time necessary to protect the lender, to compel delivery to the lender of any houses then owned and in the possession of the borrower. The loan shall have a maturity not in excess of one year from the date of the note, except that any such loan may be refinanced and extended in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe for an additional term not to exceed one year, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Release of security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the property assigned or delivered as security for the loan, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the security documents may provide for such release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments; default; insurance benefits for mortgagee; prerequisites; value of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the borrower to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the <!-- PDFPage:765 -->terms of a loan under this section, or the failure to perform any other covenant or obligation contained in any assignment, agreement, or undertaking executed by the borrower in connection with such loan, shall be considered as a default under this section, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance hereinafter provided upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary within a period and in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interest arising with respect to the loan so in default; (2) all claims of the lender against the borrower or others arising out of the loan transaction; (3) any cash or property held by the lender, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the borrower and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the loan; and (4) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the loan transaction. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery, the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment provided for in section 1739(c) of this title, issue to the lender debentures having a face value equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Debentures; date of issuance; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of section 1739(d) of this title except that such debentures shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in subsection (d) of this section and shall bear interest from such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Applicability of other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of sections 1713(k) and 1738(a) of this title shall be applicable to loans insured under this section, except that as applied to such loans (1) the reference in section 1713(k) of this title to &ldquo;subsection (g)&rdquo; shall be construed to refer to &ldquo;subsection (d)&rdquo; of this section; (2) the references in section 1713(k) of this title to insured mortgages shall be construed to refer to the assignment or other security for loans insured under this section; and (3) the references in section 1738(a) of this title to a mortgage or mortgages shall be construed to include a loan or loans under this section. The provisions of section 1738(d) of this title shall also be applicable to loans insured under this section and the reference in section 1738(d) of this title to a mortgage shall be construed to include a loan or loans with respect to which a contract of insurance is issued pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disposal of evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security; collection or compromise of obligations and rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall have the power to assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of, any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by him in connection with the payment of insurance heretofore or hereafter granted under this section, and to collect or compromise all obligations assigned to or held by him and all legal or equitable rights accruing to him in connection with the payment of such insurance until such time as such obligations may be referred to the Attorney General for suit or collection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Premium charges; amount; manner of payment; application fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall fix a premium charge for the insurance granted under this section, but such premium charge shall not exceed an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the original principal of such loan, and such premium charge shall be payable in advance by the financial institution and shall be paid at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary. In addition to the premium charge herein provided for, the Secretary is authorized to charge and collect such amounts as he may deem reasonable for examining and processing applications for the insurance of loans under this section, including such additional inspections as the Secretary may deem necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Insurance for accepting and discounting promissory notes; contract provisions; default in payments; remedies; debentures; interest; premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to the insurance of the principal loan to finance the manufacture of housing, as provided in this section, and in order to provide short-term financing in the sale of houses to be delivered pursuant to the purchase contract or contracts assigned as security for such principal loan, the Secretary is authorized, under such terms and conditions and subject to such limitations as he may prescribe, to insure the lender against any losses it may sustain resulting from the acceptance and discount of a promissory note or notes executed by a purchaser of any such houses representing an unpaid portion of the purchase price of any such houses. No such promissory note or notes accepted and discounted by the lender pursuant to this subsection shall involve a principal obligation in excess of 80 per centum of the purchase price of the manufactured house or houses; have a maturity in excess of one hundred and eighty days from the date of the note or bear interest in excess of 4 per centum per annum; nor may the principal amount of such promissory notes, with respect to any individual principal loan, outstanding and unpaid at any one time, exceed in the aggregate an amount prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to include in any contract of insurance executed by him with respect to the insurance of a loan to finance the manufacture of houses, provisions to effectuate the insurance against any such losses under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The failure of the purchaser to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of any note or notes executed by the purchaser and accepted and discounted by the lender under the provisions of this subsection, shall be considered as a default under this subsection, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance, as provided in subsection (d) of this section except that debentures issued pursuant to this subsection shall have a face value equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus interest at the rate of 4 per centum per annum from the date of default to the <!-- PDFPage:766 -->date the application is filed for the insurance benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Debentures issued with respect to the insurance granted under this subsection shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of section 1739(d) of this title except that such debentures shall be dated as of the date application is filed for the insurance benefits and shall bear interest from such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance granted under this subsection, in addition to the premium charge authorized under subsection (h) of this section. Such premium charge shall not exceed an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the original principal of such promissory note or notes and shall be paid at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Additional authorization; encouragement of cost-reduction techniques; advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to mortgages insured under other sections of this subchapter, and in order to assist and encourage the application of cost-reduction techniques through large-scale modernized site construction of housing and the erection of houses produced by modern industrial processes, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have been made to and be held by a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cover property, held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary, upon which there is to be constructed or erected dwelling units for not less than twenty-five families consisting of a group of single-family dwellings approved by the Secretary for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction: <em>Provided</em>, That during the course of construction there may be located upon the mortgaged property a plant for the fabrication or storage of such dwellings or sections or parts thereof, and the Secretary may consent to the removal or release of such plant from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may approve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to exceed 85 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the value of the completed property or project, exclusive of any plant of the character described in paragraph (2) of this subsection located thereon, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed a sum computed on the individual dwellings comprising the total project as follows: $5,950 or 85 per centum of the valuation, whichever is the lower <!-- PDFPage:768 -->amount, with respect to each single-family dwelling: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary finds that it is not feasible, within the dollar amount limitation in this clause on the principal obligation of the mortgage, to construct dwellings containing three or four bedrooms without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability, he may increase such dollar amount limitation by not exceeding $850 for each additional bedroom (as defined by the Secretary) in excess of two contained in each such dwelling if he finds that such dwelling meets sound standards of design and livability as a three-bedroom unit or a four-bedroom unit, as the case may be, but the amount computed under this clause for each such dwelling shall not exceed, in any event, $7,650.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the insurance of advances during construction, the Secretary is authorized to approve advances by the mortgagee to cover the cost of materials delivered upon the mortgaged property and labor performed in the fabrication or erection thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) as not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may prescribe by regulation a higher maximum rate of interest, not exceeding 41/2 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time, if he finds that the mortgage market demands it. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release, and the mortgage may provide that, upon the completion of the construction of the project, such mortgage may be replaced by individual mortgages covering each individual dwelling in the project. Each such individual mortgage may be insured under this section with the mortgagor being either the builder who constructed the dwellings or the owner and occupant of the dwelling at the time, and where the mortgagor is the owner and occupant, may involve a principal obligation in such amount and have such maturity and interest rate as a mortgage eligible for insurance under section 1709(b)(2)(D) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preferences in occupancy for veterans and hardship cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Preference or priority of opportunity in the occupancy of the mortgaged property for veterans of World War II and their immediate families and for hardship cases as defined by the Secretary shall be provided under such regulations and procedures as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability of other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of section 1743 of this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section covering a project described in subsection (b) of this section, and the provisions of subsections (a) to (f), and (h) of section 1739 of this title shall be applicable to the individual mortgages insured pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section&nbsp; covering&nbsp; individual&nbsp; dwellings&nbsp; in&nbsp; the project.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Aggregate amount of insurance; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage and urgent need for family housing which now exists at or in areas adjacent to military installations because of uncertainty as to the permanency of such installations and to increase the supply of necessary family housing accommodations for personnel at such installations, the Secretary is authorized, upon application of the mortgagee, to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for so insuring such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <em>Provided</em>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter (except mortgages insured pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in effect prior to August 11, 1955) shall not exceed $2,300,000,000: <em>And provided further</em>, That the limitation in section 1715h of this title shall not apply to this subchapter: <em>And provided further</em>, That no more mortgages shall be insured under this section after October 1, 1962, except pursuant to a commitment to insure before such date, and not more than twenty-eight thousand family housing units shall be contracted for after June 30, 1959, pursuant to any mortgage insured under this section after such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this subchapter a mortgage shall meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgaged property shall be held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to capital structure, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in, any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgaged property shall be designed for use for residential purposes by personnel of the armed services and situated at or near a military installation, and the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified that there is no intention, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, to substantially curtail the personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation, and (i) shall have determined that for reasons of safety, security, or other essential military requirements, it is necessary that the personnel involved reside in public quarters: <em>Provided, however</em>, That for the pur<!-- PDFPage:776 -->poses of this subsection housing covered by a mortgage insured, or for which a commitment to insure has been issued, under this section prior to August 11, 1955, may be considered the same as available quarters, and (ii) with the approval of the Secretary, shall have determined that adequate housing is not available for such personnel at reasonable rentals within reasonable commuting distance of the installation and that the mortgaged property will not, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, substantially curtail occupancy in existing housing covered by mortgages insured under this chapter. The housing accommodations shall comply with such standards and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe to establish the acceptability of such property for mortgage insurance, except that the certification of the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall (for purposes of mortgage insurance under this subchapter) be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the existence of the need for such housing. However, if the Secretary does not concur in the housing needs as certified by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund against loss with respect to the mortgage covering such housing. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the cost of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the cost of the land, the physical improvements, and utilities within the boundaries of the property or project);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit for such part of such property or project (including ranges, refrigerators, shades, screens, and fixtures) as may be attributable to dwelling use: <em>Provided</em>, That the replacement cost of the property or project as determined by the Secretary, including the estimated value of any usable utilities within the boundaries of the property or project where owned by the United States and not provided for out of the proceeds of the mortgage, shall not exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit: <em>Provided further</em>, That should the financing of housing to be constructed pursuant to a single invitation for bids be accomplished by two or more mortgages, the principal obligation of any single mortgage may exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit if the sum of the principal obligations of all mortgages for such housing does not exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit: <em>And provided further</em>, That subject to the limitations of this paragraph no family unit included in any mortgaged property shall be contracted for after June 8, 1960 if the cost of such unit exceeds $19,800; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed the bid of the eligible bidder with respect to the property or project under section 1594 of title 42.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary shall prescribe, but not to exceed thirty years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) as not to exceed 41/2 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release. The property or project may include such nondwelling facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 11/2 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge and such other charges as the Secretary may require, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. The Secretary may reduce the payment of premiums provided for herein.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Default by mortgagor; rights of mortgagee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this subchapter shall be considered a default under such <!-- PDFPage:777 -->mortgage, and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interest arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transaction. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment provided for in subsection (e) of this section, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage, and a certificate of claim as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of default, the amount the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default; less the sum of (i) any amount received on account of the mortgage after such date; and (ii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property after such date.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Debentures; execution; signature; negotiability; interest rate; tax exemption; guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary, by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, and shall bear interest from such date at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715<em>o</em> of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Claim certificates</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Laws applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of section 1713(k) and (<em>l</em>) of this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this subchapter and to property acquired by the Secretary hereunder, except that as applied to such mortgages and property, the reference in section 1713(k) of this title to subsection (g) shall be construed to refer to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Secretary's additional powers to insure certain mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also have power to insure under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter any mortgage executed in connection with the sale by him of any property acquired under this subchapter without regard to any limit as to eligibility, time or aggregate amount contained in this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Conclusiveness and validity of insurance contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:778 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Certification as to overtime wages paid to laborers and mechanics</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless the principal contractor or contractors engaged in the construction of the project involved file a certificate or certificates (at such times, in the course of construction or otherwise, as the Secretary may prescribe) certifying that the laborers and mechanics employed in the construction of such project have been paid not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for employment in excess of eight hours in any one day or in excess of forty hours in any one week.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter and in addition to mortgages insured under section 1748b of this title, the Secretary may insure any mortgage under this section which meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 1709(b) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That a mortgage insured under this section shall have been executed by a mortgagor who at the time of insurance is the owner of the property and either occupies the property or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of a change in his employment by the Armed Forces or a contractor thereof and to whom the Secretary of Defense or his designee has issued a certificate indicating that such person requires housing and is at the date of the certificate a civilian employee at a research or development installation of one of the military departments of the United States or a contractor thereof and is considered by such military department to be an essential, nontemporary employee at such date. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the employment status of the mortgagor and of the mortgagor's need for housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of housing need to Secretary; guaranty from loss; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified to the Secretary that the housing is necessary to provide adequate housing for such civilians employed in connection with such a research or development installation and that there is no present intention to substantially curtail the number of such civilian personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation. Such certification shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the need for such housing but if the Secretary determines that insurance of mortgages on such housing is not an acceptable risk, he may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall relieve the Secretary of Defense from any obligation to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to a mortgage assumed by a person ineligible to receive a certificate under subsection (a) of this section, if the original mortgagor is issued another certificate with respect to a mortgage insured under this section on property which the Secretary determines is not an acceptable risk.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Economic soundness of property</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may insure and make commitments to insure any mortgage under this section which meets the eligibility requirements hereinafter set forth.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgage shall be insured under this section unless (1) the housing which is covered by the insured mortgage is necessary in the interest of national security in order to provide adequate housing for (A) military personnel and essential civilian personnel serving or employed in connection with any installation of one of the armed services of the United States, or (B) essential personnel employed or assigned to duty at or in connection with any research or development installation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or of the Atomic Energy Commission, (2) there is no present intention to curtail substantially the number of such personnel assigned or to be assigned to the installation, (3) adequate housing is not available for such personnel at reasonable rentals within reasonable commuting distances of such installation, and (4) the mortgaged property will not so far as can be reasonably foreseen substantially curtail occupancy in any existing housing in the vicinity of the installation which is covered by mortgages insured under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Economical soundness of property or project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may accept any mortgage for insurance under this section without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter that the property or project be economically sound.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rental conditions; preferences and priorities in the sale or rental of dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require each project covered by a mortgage insured under this section to be held for rental for a period of not less than five years after the project or dwelling is made available for initial occupancy or until he finds that the housing may be released from such rental condition. The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as in his judgment are necessary to secure reasonable preference or priority in the sale or rental of dwellings covered by a mortgage insured under this section for military personnel and essential civilian employees of the armed services, employees of contractors for the armed services, and persons described in clause (1)(B) of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Property held by mortgagor approved by Secretary; acquisition of stock or interest; redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of providing multifamily rental housing projects or housing projects consisting of individual single-family dwellings for sale, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover property held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. Any such mortgagor shall possess powers necessary therefor and incidental thereto and shall until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under such insurance be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation to such extent and in such manner as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in, any such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Mortgage limitations for multifamily rental property or project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage on any multifamily rental property or project shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed, for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use, $9,000 per family unit without a bedroom, $12,500 per family unit with one bedroom, $15,000 per family unit with two bedrooms, and $18,500 per family unit with three or more bedrooms, and not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project when the proposed physical improvements are completed. The Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the foregoing dollar amount limitations contained in this paragraph by not to exceed 45 per centum in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mortgage limitation for property or project constructed for eventual sale of single-family dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage on any property or project constructed for eventual sale of single-family dwellings shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed a sum computed on the basis of a separate mortgage for each single-family dwelling (irrespective of whether such dwelling has a party wall or is otherwise physically connected with another dwelling or dwellings) comprising the property or project equal to the total of each of the maximum principal obligations of such mortgages which would meet the requirements of section 1709(b)(2) of this title if the mortgagor were the owner and occupant who had made the required payment on account of the property prescribed in such paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Amortization; interest; release of part of mortgaged property from lien; replacement of certain mortgages by individual mortgages; commercial and community facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage insured under this section shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe but not to exceed the maximum <!-- PDFPage:784 -->term applicable to mortgages under section 1713 of this title and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee, except that individual mortgages of the character described in subsection (g) of this section covering the individual dwellings in the project may have a term not in excess of the maximum term applicable to mortgages insured under section 1709 of this title or the unexpired term of the project mortgage at the time of the release of the mortgaged property from such project mortgage, whichever is the greater, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release, and a mortgage of the character described in subsection (g) of this section may provide that, at any time after the release of the project from the rental period prescribed by subsection (d) of this section, such mortgage may be replaced, in whole or in part, by individual mortgages covering each individual dwelling in the project in amounts not to exceed the unpaid balance of the blanket mortgage allocable to the individual property. Each such individual mortgage may be insured under this section. Property covered by a mortgage insured under this section may include eight or more family units and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Limitation on aggregate number of dwelling units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate number of dwelling units (including all units in multifamily projects or individual dwellings) covered by outstanding commitments to insure and mortgages insured under this section shall at no time exceed five thousand dwelling units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Applicability of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (<em>l</em>), and (n) of section 1713 of this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section except individual mortgages of the character described in subsection (g) of this section covering the individual dwellings in the project, and as to such individual mortgages the provisions of subsections (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (j), and (k) of section 1710 of this title shall be applicable: <em>Provided</em>, That wherever the words &ldquo;Fund&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund&rdquo; appear in section 1710 of this title, such reference shall refer to the General Insurance Fund with respect to mortgages insured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Aggregate amount of mortgages insured; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of sections 1748, 1748a, 1748b(c), 1748b(i), 1748b(j), 1748c(a), 1748c(b), and 1748f of this title and the provisions of section 1748b(a) of this title relating to the aggregate amount of all mortgages insured under this subchapter shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility; validity of contract incontestable</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Undertaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each mortgage insured under this subchapter shall contain an undertaking (in accordance with regulations prescribed under this subchapter and in force at the time the mortgage is approved for insurance) to the effect that, except as authorized by the Secretary and the mortgagee, the property will be used as a group practice facility or medical practice facility until the mortgage has been paid in full or the contract of insurance otherwise terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Recordkeeping; reports; examination and audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgage shall be insured under this subchapter unless the mortgagor and the mortgagee certify (1) that they will keep such records relating to the mortgage transaction and indebtedness, to the construction of the facility covered by the mortgage, and to the use of such facility as a group practice facility or medical practice facility as are prescribed by the Secretary at the time of such certification, (2) that they will make such reports as may from time to time be required by the Secretary pertaining to such matters, and (3) that the Secretary shall have access to and the right to examine and audit such records.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall fix premium charges for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter, but such charges shall not be more than 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. In addition to the premium charge, the Secretary is authorized to charge and collect such amounts as he may deem reasonable for the analysis of a proposed project and the appraisal and inspection of the property and improvements. Where the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge. This charge shall be in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until the maturity date. Where such prepayment occurs, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. Premium charges fixed under this section shall be payable by the mortgagee either in cash, or in debentures which are the obligation of the General Insurance Fund at par plus accrued interest, at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1 of Pub. L. 94&ndash;13 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds that (1) under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Public Law 90&ndash;448, approved August 1, 1968), as amended [this subchapter], the powers of the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to enter into new reinsurance contracts with respect to the Federal riot reinsurance program and into new direct insurance contracts with respect to the Federal crime insurance program will terminate on April 30, 1975, except to the extent necessary (a) to continue policies of direct insurance and reinsurance, until April 30, 1978, (b) to handle claims and those arising under the policies still in force on the termination date of the program, and (c) to complete the liquidation and termination of the reinsurance and direct insurance programs; (2) continuation of the Federal riot reinsurance program is essential both to the operation of the system of State FAIR plans, which provide access for many people to basic property insurance not otherwise available in urban areas, and to the continued existence of such FAIR plans inasmuch as many State laws condition the very existence of such FAIR plans upon the continued existence of the Federal riot reinsurance program; (3) continuation of the Federal crime insurance program, which provides access for many homeowners, tenants, and small busi<!-- PDFPage:794 -->nessmen to burglary, robbery, and similar coverages, in States where an insurance coverage availability problem exists, is likewise essential; (4) withdrawal at this time of the Federal support which these programs give to the insurance buying public and the insurers would be particularly ill timed and inadvisable in view of the (a) threatening major shortage of voluntary insurance facilities to which the consumer can turn to fulfill his insurance purchase needs and (b) the potential for insurer insolvencies inherent in times of economic stress; and (5) the impending tightening of the availability of insurance coverage in the insurance market will only intensify due to the present economic conditions confronting insurers, which affect the capital adequacies of insurers due to severe declines in the values of insurers&rsquo; securities portfolios, thus impacting on their ability to increase their underwritings in a growing insurance market.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to extend the duration of the national insurance development program so as to maintain the Federal riot reinsurance program which reinsures the general property insurance business against the catastrophic peril of riot and, thus, makes this insurance available, together with its review and compliance function which assures that the intent of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Public Law 90&ndash;448, approved August 1, 1968) as amended [this subchapter] is carried out, as well as the Federal crime insurance program which provides basic crime insurance coverages in the States where it is needed, both of which programs aid the insurance purchasing consumer when, from time to time and especially in times such as these, insurers engage in conscious policies of market constriction which lead to serious inner-city insurance availability problems of the kind the national insurance development program has been created to ameliorate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1102 of Pub. L. 90&ndash;448, as amended by Pub. L. 91&ndash;609, title VI, &sect;601, Dec. 31, 1970, 84 Stat. 1788, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds that (1) the vitality of many American cities is being threatened by the deterioration of their inner city areas; responsible owners of well-maintained residential, business, and other properties in many of these areas are unable to obtain adequate property insurance coverage against fire, crime, and other perils; the lack of such insurance coverage accelerates the deterioration of these areas by discouraging private investment and restricting the availability of credit to repair and improve property therein; and this deterioration poses a serious threat to the national economy; (2) recent riots and other civil commotion in many American cities have brought about abnormally high losses to the private property insurance industry for which adequate reinsurance cannot be obtained at reasonable cost, and the risk of such losses will make most lines of property insurance even more difficult to obtain; (3) the capacity of the private property insurance industry to provide adequate insurance is threatened, and the continuity of such property insurance protection is essential to the extension of credit in these areas; and (4) the national interest demands urgent action by the Congress to assure that essential lines of property insurance, including lines providing protection against riot and civil commotion damage will be available to property owners at reasonable cost.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The purposes of this title [this subchapter] are, therefore, to (1) encourage and assist the various State insurance authorities and the property insurance industry to develop and carry out statewide programs which will make necessary property insurance coverage against the fire, crime, and other perils more readily available for residential, business, and other properties meeting reasonable underwriting standards; (2) provide a Federal program of reinsurance against abnormally high property insurance losses resulting from riots and other civil commotion, placing appropriate financial responsibility upon the States to share in such losses; and (3) provide direct insurance through the facilities of the Federal Government in the case of properties for which statewide programs and the Federal reinsurance program either do not make crime insurance available or offer such insurance to property owners only at prohibitive cost.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cooperation by insurers with State insurance authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each insurer reinsured under this subchapter shall cooperate with the State insurance authority in each State in which it is to acquire such reinsurance in establishing and carrying out statewide plans to assure fair access to insurance requirements (FAIR plans).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval and administration of plans; provisions of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such plans must be approved by, and administered under the supervision of, the State insurance authority, or be authorized or required by State law, and shall be designed to make essential property insurance more readily available in, but not necessarily limited to, urban areas. Such plans may vary in detail from State to State because of local conditions, but all plans shall contain provisions that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no risk shall be written at surcharged rates or be denied insurance coverage for essential property insurance unless there has first been an inspection of the risk, without cost to the owner, by an inspection facility and a determination by the insurer, based on information in the inspection report and other sources, that the risk does not meet reasonable underwriting standards at the applicable premium rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inspections under the plan may be requested by the property owner or his representative, the insurer, or the insurance agent, broker or other producer, and such requests need not be made in writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the absence of a building owner or his representative during an inspection shall not preclude a tenant seeking insurance from obtaining an inspection under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) following the inspection, a copy of the inspection report shall be promptly sent by the inspection facility to the insurer or insurers, or to an all-industry placement facility referred to under section 1749bbb&ndash;4 of this title, as may be designated by the person requesting the inspection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) after the inspection report is received by an insurer, it shall promptly determine if the risk meets reasonable underwriting standards at the applicable premium rate, and shall promptly return to the inspection facility the inspection report and provide an action report setting forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the amount of coverage it agrees to write; and if the insurer agrees to write the coverage with a surcharge (if such a surcharge is authorized by the State insurance authority), the improvements necessary before it will provide coverage at an unsurcharged premium rate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount of coverage it agrees to write if certain improvements specified in the action report are made; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the specific reasons it declines to write coverage;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) if the insurer declines the risk, or agrees to write the coverage sought on condition that the property will be improved, it shall also promptly send a copy of both the inspection and action reports to the property owner and the State insurance authority, and at the time the insurer sends such reports to the property owner, it shall also explain his right, under applicable State laws, to appeal the decision of the insurer to the State insurance authority, setting forth the procedures to be followed for such appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) all policies written pursuant to the plan shall be promptly written after inspection or reinspection and shall be separately coded so that appropriate records may be compiled for purposes of performing loss prevention and other studies of the operation of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the inspection facility shall submit to the State insurance authority and to the Director periodic reports setting forth information, by individual insurers, including the number of risks inspected under the plan, the number of risks accepted, the number of risks conditionally accepted and reinspections made, the number of risks declined, and such other information as the State insurance authority may request;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) notice will be given to any policyholder a reasonable time prior to the cancellation or nonrenewal of any risk eligible under the plan (except in case of nonpayment of premium or evidence of incendiarism), to allow ample time for an application for new coverage to be made and a new policy to be written under the plan, and the insurer shall, in writing, explain to the policyholder the procedures for obtaining an inspection under the plan in the notice of cancellation or nonrenewal; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:797 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) a continuing public education program will be undertaken by the participating insurers, agents, and brokers to assure that the plan receives adequate public attention.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Membership of board of directors, board, etc., for each plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At least one-third of the voting members of every board of directors, board of governors, advisory committee, and other governing or advisory board or committee for each plan described in subsection (b) of this section shall be individuals who are not employed by, or otherwise affiliated with, insurers, insurance agents, brokers, producers, or other entities of the insurance industry.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Limitations; termination of certain commitments; requirements; discrimination against children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This subchapter is designed to supplement systems of mortgage insurance under other provisions of this chapter in order to assist in providing adequate housing in areas which the President, pursuant to section 1591 of title 42, shall have determined to be critical defense housing areas. The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this section or section 1750g of this title as hereinafter provided any mortgage which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <em>Provided</em>, That the property covered by the mortgage is in an area which the President, pursuant to section 1591 of title 42, shall have determined to be a critical defense housing area, and that the total number of dwelling units in properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter in any such area does not exceed the number authorized by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from time to time as needed in such area for defense purposes and to be insured pursuant to this subchapter: <em>Provided further</em>, That in the event the Secretary has issued a commitment to insure a mortgage under this section, which commitment was in force and effect on June 1, 1953, and the Secretary determines that, because of changes in defense requirements, there is reasonable doubt that such housing is needed for defense purposes and that it is probable that the mortgage would become immediately in default and claim made for payment under the mortgage insurance contract if the unit or units are completed and the mortgage insured, the Secretary is authorized, in the interest of conserving the General Insurance Fund, to pay (in cash from the General Insurance Fund) to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor such amount as the Secretary shall determine to be necessary to reimburse the mortgagor the amounts paid or to be paid by the mortgagor on account of labor performed and materials in place, less the Secretary's estimate of the reasonable salvage value of such materials, plus an allowance for development costs equal to 4 per centum of the principal amount of the mortgage specified in such commitment, and no payments shall be made pursuant to this proviso unless a claim therefor is filed not later than six months from date of the determination of lack of need and the claim is in such form and contains such supporting information, documents, and data as the Secretary may require: <em>Provided further</em>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter shall not exceed such sum as may be authorized by the President from time to time for the purposes of this subchapter pursuant to his authority under section 1715h&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1750b_1_target" name="1750b_1">1</a></sup> of this title: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary shall have power to require properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter to be held for rental for such periods of time and at such rentals or other charges as he may prescribe; and, with respect to such properties being held for rental, (1) to require that the property be held by a mortgagor approved by him, and (2) to prescribe such requirements as he deems to be reasonable governing the method of operation and prohibiting or restricting sales of such properties or interests therein or agreements relating to such sales: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary shall require each dwelling covered by a mortgage insured under this section, for which a commitment to insure is issued after August 2, 1954, to be held for rental for a period of not less than three years after the dwelling is made available for initial occupancy: <em>And provided further</em>, That no mortgage shall be insured under this subchapter unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for any property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certification to be filed with the Secretary. Violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:806 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the appraised value (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance) of a property, urban, suburban, or rural, upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for residential use for not more than two families in the aggregate, which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction, the construction of which is begun after September 1, 1951. The principal obligation of such mortgage shall not, however, exceed $8,100 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or $15,000 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence except that the Secretary may by regulation increase these amounts to not to exceed $9,000 and $16,000, respectively, in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary finds that it is not feasible within the aforesaid dollar amount limitations to construct dwellings containing three or four bedrooms per family unit without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability, he may increase such dollar amount limitations by not exceeding $1,080 for each additional bedroom (as defined by the Secretary) in excess of two contained in such family unit if he finds that such unit meets sound standards of livability as a three-bedroom or a four-bedroom unit as the case may be;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed thirty years from the date of the insurance of the mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 41/2 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as herein provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges; payments; needs of national defense as prerequisite; adjustments and refunds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 11/2 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this subchapter&nbsp; unless&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; finds&nbsp; that&nbsp; the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk in view of the needs of national defense. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage has continued to be insured under this subchapter until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. Upon application of the mortgagee with the consent of the mortgagor of a mortgage for which a commitment to insure has been issued pursuant to section 1709 of this title covering property on which the construction of the dwellings thereon was begun prior to the enactment of this subchapter and the determination of prevailing wages in the locality in accordance with section 1715c of this title, the Secretary is authorized, notwithstanding such beginning of construction, to convert such commitment to a commitment under section 1750g of this title; any charges or fees paid to the Secretary with respect to such insurance under section 1709 of this title shall be credited to charges or fees due the Secretary with respect to such insurance under section 1750g of this title; and the determination of prevailing wages in the locality for purposes of section 1715c of this title may be made by the Secretary of Labor at any time prior to the insurance under section 1750g of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That such mortgage, or the mortgage covering the same property executed in substitution therefor, is otherwise eligible for insurance under section 1750g of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:807 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preference or priority in purchasing or renting properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or any other Act, except provisions of law enacted hereafter expressly referring to this subsection (d), the Secretary is further authorized to prescribe such procedures as are necessary to secure to persons engaged or to be engaged in national defense activities preference or priority of opportunity to purchase or rent properties, or interests therein, covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conveyance and assignment by mortgagee after foreclosure; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under section 1750b of this title shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property, in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Secretary, or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment hereinafter provided, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage and a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure, the amount of all payments which have been made by the mortgagee for taxes, ground rents, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage, special assessments which are noted on the application for insurance or which become liens after the insurance of the mortgage, insurance of the mortgaged property, and any mortgage insurance premiums and by deducting from such total amount any amount received on account of the mortgage after either of such dates and any amount received as rent or other income from the property, less reasonable expenses incurred in handling the property, after either of such dates: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to mortgages which are foreclosed before there shall have been paid on account of the principal obligation of the mortgage a sum equal to 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage was accepted for insurance, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary, on account of the cost of foreclosure (or of acquiring the property by other means) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings and not in excess of $75; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not in excess of two-thirds of such cost, whichever is the greater: <em>Provided further</em>, That with respect to any debentures issued on or after September 2, 1964, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e) of this section), include in debentures, in addition to amounts otherwise al<!-- PDFPage:808 -->lowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 532 and 536 of the Appendix to title 50, apply and which are insured under section 1750b of this title, and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of insurance premiums by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consent to release of mortgagee or property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Debentures; form and denomination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the amount of debentures to which the mortgagee is entitled under this section or section 1750g of this title and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $350, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The debentures issued under this section to any mortgagee shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default, except that debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the mortgage was accepted for insurance, but not to exceed 3 per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year. Such debentures shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, or gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, and shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event that the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures issued under this subchapter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certificate of claim; division of excess proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee under this section shall be for an amount determined in accordance with, and shall contain provisions and shall be paid in accordance with, the provisions of section 1710(e) and section 1710(f) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power to deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit, in his discretion, any properties conveyed to him in exchange for debentures and certificates of claim as provided in this section; and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against mortgagors assigned by mortgagees to the Secretary as provided in this subchapter: <em>Provided</em>, That section 5 of title 41 shall not be construed to apply to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyances, deeds of release, assignments, and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:809 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mortgagor's or mortgagee's interest in property or claim conveyed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgagee or mortgagor shall have, and no certification of claim shall be construed to give to any mortgagee or mortgagor, any right or interest in any property conveyed to the Secretary or in any claim assigned to him; nor shall the Secretary owe any duty to any mortgagee or mortgagor with respect to the handling or disposal of any such property or the collection of any such claim.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In addition to mortgages insured under section 1750b of this title, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages as defined in section 1750 of this title (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided.</p>

The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in <!-- PDFPage:810 -->any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed $8,100 per family unit (or $7,200 per family unit if the number of rooms in such property or project does not equal or exceed four per family unit) for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may by regulation increase such dollar amount limitations by not exceeding $900 in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgagor shall enter into the agreement required by section 1715r of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 41/2 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Default; debentures; cash adjustment; certificate of claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgagee shall be entitled to receive debentures in connection with mortgages insured under this section in the amount and under the conditions specified in subsection (g) of section 1713 of this title, and the references in said subsection (g) to the cash adjustment provided for in subsection (j) of section 1713 and to the certificate of claim provided for in subsection (h) of section 1713 shall be deemed to refer respectively to the cash adjustment provided for in subsection (c) of section 1750c of this title and to the certificate of claim provided for in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
