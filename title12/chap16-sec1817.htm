<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reports of condition; access to reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each insured State nonmember bank (except a District bank) and each foreign bank having an insured branch which is not a Federal branch shall make to the Corporation reports of condition which shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Board of Directors may require. Such reports shall be made to the Corporation on the dates selected as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection and the deposit liabilities shall be reported therein in accordance with and pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection. The Board of Directors may call for additional reports of condition on dates to be fixed by it and may call for such other reports as the Board may from time to time require. Any such bank which (A) maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to make or publish any report required under this paragraph, within the period of time specified by the Corporation, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, or (B) inadvertently transmits or publishes any report which is minimally late, shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $2,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Such bank shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent and that a report was inadvertently transmitted or published late. Any such bank which fails to make or publish any report required under this paragraph, within the period of time specified by the Corporation, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, in a manner not described in the 2nd preceding sentence shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $20,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any such bank knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any information or report described in such sentence submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, the Corporation may assess a penalty of not more than $1,000,000 or 1 percent of total assets of such bank, whichever is less, per day for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Any penalty imposed under any of the 4 preceding sentences shall be assessed and collected by the Corporation in the manner provided in subparagraphs (E), (F), (G), and (I) of section 1818(i)(2) of this title (for penalties imposed under such section) and any such assessment (including the determination of the amount of the penalty) shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Any such bank against which any penalty is assessed under this subsection shall be afforded an agency hearing if such bank submits a request for such hearing within 20 days <!-- PDFPage:944 -->after the issuance of the notice of assessment. Section 1818(h) of this title shall apply to any proceeding under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Corporation and, with respect to any State depository institution, any appropriate State bank supervisor for such institution, shall have access to reports of examination made by, and reports of condition made to, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Housing Finance Board, any Federal home loan bank, or any Federal Reserve bank and to all revisions of reports of condition made to any of them, and they shall promptly advise the Corporation of any revisions or changes in respect to deposit liabilities made or required to be made in any report of condition. The Corporation may accept any report made by or to any commission, board, or authority having supervision of a depository institution, and may furnish to the Comptroller of the Currency, the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1817_1_target" name="1817_1">1</a></sup> Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1817_1_target" name="1817_1">1</a></sup> Federal Housing Finance Board, any&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1817_1_target" name="1817_1">1</a></sup> Federal home loan bank, to any Federal Reserve bank, and to any such commission, board, or authority, reports of examinations made on behalf of, and reports of condition made to, the Corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) <cap-smallcap>Additional reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board of Directors may from time to time require any insured depository institution to file such additional reports as the Corporation, after agreement with the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, as appropriate, may deem advisable for insurance purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each insured depository institution shall make to the appropriate Federal banking agency 4 reports of condition annually upon dates which shall be selected by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. The dates selected shall be the same for all insured depository institutions, except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any depository institution, the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. Two dates shall be selected within the semiannual period of January to June inclusive, and the reports on such dates shall be the basis for the certified statement to be filed in July pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and two dates shall be selected within the semiannual period of July to December inclusive, and the reports on such dates shall be the basis for the certified statement to be filed in January pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The deposit liabilities shall be reported in said reports of conditions in accordance with and pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection, and such other information shall be reported therein as may be required by the respective agencies. Each said report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, a vice president, the cashier or the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors or trustees of the reporting depository institution to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. The correctness of said report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of at least two directors or trustees of the reporting depository institution other than the officer making such declaration, with a declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct. At the time of making said reports of condition each insured depository institution shall furnish to the Corporation a copy thereof containing such signed declaration and attestations. Nothing herein shall preclude any of the foregoing agencies from requiring the banks or savings associations under its jurisdiction to make additional reports of condition at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the reports of condition required to be made by paragraph (3) of this subsection, each insured depository institution shall report the total amount of the liability of the depository institution for deposits in the main office and in any branch located in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, any Territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Virgin Islands, according to the definition of the term &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; in and pursuant to subsection (<em>l</em>) of section 1813 of this title without any deduction for indebtedness of depositors or creditors or any deduction for cash items in the process of collection drawn on others than the reporting depository institution: <em>Provided</em>, That the depository institution in reporting such deposits may (i) subtract from the deposit balance due to any depository institution the deposit balance due from the same depository institution (other than trust funds deposited by either depository institution) and any cash items in the process of collection due from or due to such depository institutions shall be included in determining such net balance, except that balances of time deposits of any depository institution and any balances standing to the credit of private depository institutions, of depository institutions in foreign countries, of foreign branches of other American depository institutions, and of American branches of foreign banks shall be reported gross without any such subtraction, and (ii) exclude any deposits received in any office of the depository institution for deposit in any other office of the depository institution: <em>And provided further</em>, That outstanding drafts (including advices and authorizations to charge depository institution's balance in another depository institution) drawn in the regular course of business by the reporting depository institution on depository institutions need not be reported as deposit liabilities. The amount of trust funds held in the depository institution's own trust department, which the reporting depository institution keeps segregated and apart from its general assets and does not use in the conduct of its business, shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be separately stated in such reports. Deposits which are accumulated for the payment of personal loans and are assigned or pledged to assure payment of loans at maturity shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be deducted from the <!-- PDFPage:945 -->loans for which such deposits are assigned or pledged to assure repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The deposits to be reported on such reports of condition shall be segregated between (i) time and savings deposits and (ii) demand deposits. For this purpose, the time and savings deposits shall consist of time certificates of deposit, time deposits-open account, and savings deposits; and demand deposits shall consist of all deposits other than time and savings deposits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Lifeline account deposits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the reports of condition required to be reported under this subsection, the deposits in lifeline accounts (as defined in section 1834(a)(3)(C) of this title) shall be reported separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Board of Directors, after consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, may by regulation define the terms &ldquo;cash items&rdquo; and &ldquo;process of collection&rdquo;, and shall classify deposits as &ldquo;time&rdquo;, &ldquo;savings&rdquo;, and &ldquo;demand&rdquo; deposits, for the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In respect of any report required or authorized to be supplied or published pursuant to this subsection or any other provision of law, the Board of Directors or the Comptroller of the Currency, as the case may be, may differentiate between domestic banks and foreign banks to such extent as, in their judgment, may be reasonably required to avoid hardship and can be done without substantial compromise of insurance risk or supervisory and regulatory effectiveness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) <cap-smallcap>Data collections</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to or in connection with any other report required under this subsection, the Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each insured depository institution maintains; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Corporation receives on a regular basis from such institution,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">information on the total amount of all insured deposits, preferred deposits, and uninsured deposits at the institution. In prescribing reporting and other requirements for the collection of actual and accurate information pursuant to this paragraph, the Corporation shall minimize the regulatory burden imposed upon insured depository institutions that are well capitalized (as defined in section 1831<em>o</em> of this title) while taking into account the benefit of the information to the Corporation, including the use of the information to enable the Corporation to more accurately determine the total amount of insured deposits in each insured depository institution for purposes of compliance with this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) A Federal banking agency may not, by regulation or otherwise, designate, or require an insured institution or an affiliate to designate, a corporation as highly leveraged or a transaction with a corporation as a highly leveraged transaction solely because such corporation is or has been a debtor or bankrupt under title 11, if, after confirmation of a plan of reorganization, such corporation would not otherwise be highly leveraged.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Bank Enterprise Act requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation shall design the risk-based assessment system so that, insofar as the system bases assessments, directly or indirectly, on deposits, the portion of the deposits of any insured depository institution which are attributable to lifeline accounts established in accordance with the Bank Enterprise Act of 1991 shall be subject to assessment at a rate determined in accordance with such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to provide sufficient assessment income to repay obligations issued to and other amounts borrowed from Bank Insurance Fund members under section 1824(d) of this title; or</p>
