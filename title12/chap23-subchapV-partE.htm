<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this section, the term &ldquo;government-guaranteed&rdquo;, when applied to a loan or an investment, means a loan, credit, or investment, or portion of a loan, credit, or investment, that is guaranteed&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount in Fund exceeding secure base amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the secure base amount, the Corporation shall reduce the premium due from each insured System bank, as determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section, by a percentage determined by the Corporation so that the aggregate of the premiums payable by all System banks is sufficient to ensure that the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund after such premiums are paid is not less than the secure base amount at such time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of subsections (a) and (c), the principal outstanding on all loans made by an insured System bank, and the amount outstanding on all investments made by an insured System bank, shall be determined based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) all loans or investments made by any production credit association, or any other association making direct loans under authority provided under section 2279b of this title, that is able to make such loans or investments because such association is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) all loans or investments made by any bank, company, institution, corporation, union, or association described in section 2015(b)(1)(B) of this title, that is able to make such loans or investments because such entity is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Use of funds in Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the sum of the operating expenses of the Corporation and the insurance obligations of the Corporation for a calendar year exceeds the sum of operating expenses and insurance obligations determined under paragraph (3) for the calendar year, the Corporation shall cover the expenses and obligations by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reducing each Allocated Insurance Reserves Account by the same proportion; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Authority to eliminate or reduce payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation may eliminate or reduce payments during a calendar year under subparagraph (A) if the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that the payments, or other circumstances that might require use of the Farm Credit Insurance Fund, could cause the amount in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund during the calendar year to be less than the secure base amount.</p>
