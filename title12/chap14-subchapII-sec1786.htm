<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Termination of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any insured credit union other than a Federal credit union may, upon not less than ninety days&rsquo; written notice to the Board and upon the affirmative vote of a majority of its members within one year prior to the giving of such notice, terminate its status as an insured credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any insured credit union, other than a Federal credit union, which has obtained a new cer<!-- PDFPage:844 -->tificate of insurance from a corporation authorized and duly licensed to insure member accounts may upon not less than ninety days&rsquo; written notice to the Board convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That at the time of giving notice to the Board the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not being invoked against the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unsound condition of credit union; notice to correct condition; hearing; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union is engaging or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of such credit union, or is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured credit union, or is violating or has violated an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the credit union, or is violating or has violated any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board shall serve upon the credit union a statement with respect to such practices or conditions or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof. In the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board shall send a copy of such statement to the commission, board, or authority, if any, having supervision of such credit union. Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty days after service of such statement, or within such shorter period of not less than twenty days after such service as the Board shall require in any case where it determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union could be unduly jeopardized by further delay in the correction of such practices or conditions or violations, or as the commission, board, or authority having supervision of such credit union, if any, shall require in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the credit union not less than thirty days&rsquo; written notice of its intention to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured credit union. Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe and unsound practices or conditions or violations and shall fix a time and place for a hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of the credit union. Unless the credit union shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured credit union. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or violation specified in the notice has been established and has not been corrected within the time above-prescribed in which to make such correction, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union an order terminating its status as an insured credit union on a date subsequent to the date of such finding and subsequent to the expiration of the time specified in the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any credit union whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to members of termination of insured status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of the termination of a credit union's status as an insured credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the credit union shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its members whose accounts are insured that it has ceased to be an insured credit union. It may include in such notice a statement of the fact that member accounts insured on the effective date of such termination, to the extent not withdrawn, remain insured for one year from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured credit union. In the event of failure to give the notice as herein provided to members whose accounts are insured, the Board is authorized to give reasonable notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Continuation of insurance for one year; approval of conversion of status; procedure subsequent to approval; reduction of premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After the termination of the insured status of any credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, insurance of its member accounts to the extent that they were insured on the effective date of such termination, less any amounts thereafter withdrawn which reduce the accounts below the amount covered by insurance on the effective date of such termination, shall continue for a period of one year, but no shares issued by the credit union or deposits made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Board. The credit union shall continue to maintain its deposit with and pay premiums to the Board during such period as in the case of an insured credit union and the Board shall have the right to examine such credit union from time to time during the period during which such insurance continues. Such credit union shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured credit union for the period of one year from the date of such termination. In the event that such credit union shall be closed for liquidation within such period of one year, the Board shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such credit union as in the case of an insured credit union. Notwithstanding the above, when an insured credit union's insured status is terminated and the credit union subsequently obtains comparable insurance coverage from another source, insurance of its accounts by the fund may cease immediately upon the effective date of such comparable coverage by mutual consent of the credit union and the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No credit union shall convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section until the proposition for such conversion has been approved by a majority of all the directors of the credit union, and by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who <!-- PDFPage:845 -->vote on the proposition in a vote in which at least 20 per centum of the total membership of the credit union participates. Following approval by the directors, written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the membership vote shall be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the records of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. The membership shall be given the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. If the proposition is approved by the membership, prompt and reasonable notice of insurance conversion shall be given to all members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event of a conversion of a credit union from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section, premium charges payable under section 1782(c) of this title shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the number of calendar months for which the converting credit union will no longer be insured under this chapter. As long as a converting credit union remains insured under this chapter it shall remain subject to all of the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Opinion of Board as to unsound condition of credit union; notice of charges; hearing; order to cease and desist; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union, credit union which has insured accounts, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such credit union, or is violating or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the credit union or any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the credit union or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Board shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the credit union or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the credit union or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from violations or practices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection and subsection (f) of this section which requires an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party to take affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice with respect to which such order is issued includes the authority to require such insured credit union or such party to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such credit union or such party was unjustly enriched in connection with such violation or practice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the violation or practice involved a reckless disregard for the law or any applicable regulations or prior order of the Board;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) restrict the growth of the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) rescind agreements or contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) dispose of any loan or asset involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) employ qualified officers or employees (who may be subject to approval by the Board at the direction of such Board); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) take such other action as the Board determines to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Authority to limit activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection or subsection (f) of this section includes the authority to place limitations on the activities or functions of an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Temporary cease and desist order; injunctive procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Board shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the credit union or any institution-affiliated party pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of the credit union, or is likely to weaken the condition of the credit union or otherwise prejudice the interests of its insured members prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, the Board may issue a temporary order requiring the credit union or <!-- PDFPage:846 -->such party to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (e)(3)(B) of this section. Such order shall become effective upon service upon the credit union or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the credit union or such party, until the effective date of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within ten days after the credit union concerned or any institution-affiliated party has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the credit union or such party may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the credit union is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the credit union or such party under paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Incomplete or inaccurate records.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Temporary order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a notice of charges served under subsection (e)(1) of this section specifies, on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, that an insured credit union's books and records are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Board is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of that insured credit union or the details or purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that insured credit union, the Board may issue a temporary order requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the proceedings under subsection (e)(1) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Effective period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any temporary order issued under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall become effective upon service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and enforceable until the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under subsection (e)(1) of this section in connection with the notice of charges; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the date the Board determines, by examination or otherwise, that the insured credit union's books and records are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the credit union.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary cease-and-desist order, the Board may apply to the United States district court, or the United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which the principal office of the credit union is located for an injunction to enforce such order, and, if the court shall determine that there has been such violation or threatened violation or failure to obey, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Removal and prohibition authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>Authority to issue order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Board determines that&mdash;</p>
