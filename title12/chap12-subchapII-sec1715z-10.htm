<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria; principal obligation limitation; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter mortgages and loans with provisions of varying rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in family income or with monthly payments and outstanding balances adjusted by a percentage change in a selected price index to the extent he determines such mortgages or loans (1) have promise for expanding housing opportunities or meet special needs, (2) can be developed to include any safeguards for mortgagors or purchasers that may be necessary to offset special risks of such mortgages, and (3) have a potential for acceptance in the private market. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the principal obligation (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) of a mortgage insured pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 97 per centum of the appraised value of the property covered by the mortgage as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, or if the mortgagor is a veteran and the mortgage is to be insured in accordance with the provisions of section 1709 of this title, such higher percentage of appraised value as is provided for purposes of determining the maximum mortgage amount eligible for insurance under section 1709(b)(2) of this title in the case of veterans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inapplicability of principal obligation limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage or loan which meets the requirements of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and which has provisions for varying rates of amortization if the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the mortgagor could not reasonably afford to purchase the dwelling unit by means of a mortgage insured under subsection (a) of this section or any other mortgage insurance program under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan initially does not exceed the percentage of the initial appraised value of the property specified in section 1709(b) of this title as of the date the mortgage or loan is accepted for insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan thereafter (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) will not at any time be scheduled to exceed 97 per centum, or, if the mortgagor is a veteran, such higher percentage as is provided under section 1709(b)(2) of this title for veterans, of the projected value of the property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the principal obligation of the mortgage thereafter will not exceed 113 per centum of the initial appraised value of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Mortgage insurance under this subsection shall be limited to mortgages executed by mortgagors <!-- PDFPage:673 -->who, as determined by the Secretary, have not owned dwelling units within the preceding three years. For the purpose of this subsection, the projected value of the property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the initial appraised value of the property at a rate not in excess of 21/2 per centum per annum. The number of mortgages which are insured in accordance with this subsection in any fiscal year may not exceed (A) that number of mortgages the aggregate initial principal obligation of which equals 10 per centum of the aggregate amount of the initial principal obligation of all mortgages secured by properties improved by one- to four-family residences which are insured under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year, or (B) 50,000 mortgages, whichever is greater. No loan or mortgage may be insured under this subsection after February 5, 1988, except pursuant to a commitment to insure entered into on or before February 5, 1988.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mortgages with monthly adjustments based on selected price index; priority; regulations; number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage or loan that meets the requirements of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and that has provisions permitting adjustment of monthly payments and outstanding principal according to changes or percentages of changes in a selected price index if the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan initially does not exceed the percentage of the initial appraised value of the property specified in section 1709(b) of this title as of the date the mortgage or loan is accepted for insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the monthly payments and principal obligation of the mortgage or loan thereafter will not at any time be increased at a rate greater than the percentage change in the price index stipulated in the initial mortgage or loan contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall give a priority to mortgages executed by mortgagors who, as determined by the Secretary, have not owned dwelling units within the preceding 3 years. The Secretary shall, not later than March 31, 1984, prescribe regulations establishing guidelines governing mortgages and loans described in this subsection and shall, to the extent practicable, conduct a demonstration program to insure mortgages and loans in accordance with this subsection during fiscal years 1984 and 1985. The aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured under this subsection and section 1715z&ndash;17 of this title in any fiscal year may not exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Multifamily housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may insure, under any provision of this subchapter relating to multifamily housing projects, mortgages and loans with provisions of varying rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in project income, to the extent the Secretary determines such mortgages or loans (A) have promise for expanding housing opportunities or meet special needs; (B) can be developed to include any safeguards for mortgagors, tenants, or purchasers that may be necessary to offset special risks of such mortgages; and (C) have a potential for acceptance in the private market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the principal obligation of a mortgage or loan insured pursuant to this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may not exceed initially the percentage of the initial appraised value or replacement cost of the property involved that is required by the provision of this subchapter under which such property is insured; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) thereafter (including all interest to be deferred and added to principal) may not at any time be scheduled to exceed 100 percent of the projected value of such property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the projected value of a property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the initial appraised value of such property at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Inapplicability of State constitution, etc., provision limiting interest or requiring minimum amortization of principal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage or loan insured pursuant to this section which contains or sets forth any graduated mortgage provisions (including but not limited to provisions for adding deferred interest to principal) which are authorized under this section and applicable regulations, or which have been insured on the basis of their being so authorized, shall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, or rule or public policy (1) limiting the amount of interest which may be charged, taken, received, or reserved, or the manner of calculating such interest (including but not limited to prohibitions against the charging of interest on interest), if such constitution, statute, court decree, common law, or rule would not apply to the mortgage or loan in the absence of such graduated payment mortgage provisions, or (2) requiring a minimum amortization of principal under the mortgage or loan.</p>
