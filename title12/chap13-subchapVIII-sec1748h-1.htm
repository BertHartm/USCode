<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements; certificate of need for housing and employment status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter and in addition to mortgages insured under section 1748b of this title, the Secretary may insure any mortgage under this section which meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 1709(b) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That a mortgage insured under this section shall have been executed by a mortgagor who at the time of insurance is the owner of the property and either occupies the property or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of a change in his employment by the Armed Forces or a contractor thereof and to whom the Secretary of Defense or his designee has issued a certificate indicating that such person requires housing and is at the date of the certificate a civilian employee at a research or development installation of one of the military departments of the United States or a contractor thereof and is considered by such military department to be an essential, nontemporary employee at such date. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the employment status of the mortgagor and of the mortgagor's need for housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of housing need to Secretary; guaranty from loss; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified to the Secretary that the housing is necessary to provide adequate housing for such civilians employed in connection with such a research or development installation and that there is no present intention to substantially curtail the number of such civilian personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation. Such certification shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the need for such housing but if the Secretary determines that insurance of mortgages on such housing is not an acceptable risk, he may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall relieve the Secretary of Defense from any obligation to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to a mortgage assumed by a person ineligible to receive a certificate under subsection (a) of this section, if the original mortgagor is issued another certificate with respect to a mortgage insured under this section on property which the Secretary determines is not an acceptable risk. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Economic soundness of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may accept any mortgage for insurance under this section without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter, that the project or property be economically sound or an acceptable risk.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of insurance; meaning of terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (j), and (k) of section 1710 of this title shall apply to mortgages insured under this section except that as applicable to those mortgages: (1) all references to the &ldquo;Fund&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund&rdquo; shall refer to the &ldquo;General Insurance Fund&rdquo; and (2) all references to section 1709 of this title shall refer to this section.</p>
