<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reports of condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each insured credit union shall make reports of condition to the Board upon dates which shall be selected by it. Such reports of condition shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Board may require. The reporting dates selected for reports of condition shall be the same for all insured credit unions except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any credit union the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. The <!-- PDFPage:867 -->total amount of the member accounts of each insured credit union as of each reporting date shall be reported in such reports of condition in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board. Each report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, by a vice president, by the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors of the reporting credit union to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of such officer's knowledge and belief. Unless such requirement is waived by the Board, the correctness of each report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of three of the officers of the reporting credit union with the declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board may call for such other reports as it may from time to time require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Board may require reports of condition to be published in such manner, not inconsistent with any applicable law, as it may direct. Any insured credit union which maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, or inadvertently transmits or publishes any report which is minimally late, shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $2,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. The insured credit union shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent and that a report was inadvertently transmitted or published late. Any insured credit union which fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, in a manner not described in the 2nd preceding sentence shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $20,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any insured credit union knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any information or report described in such sentence submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, the Board may assess a penalty of not more than $1,000,000 or 1 percent of total assets of such credit union, whichever is less, per day for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Any penalty imposed under any of the 4 preceding sentences shall be assessed and collected by the Board in the manner provided in section 1786(k)(2) of this title (for penalties imposed under such section) and any such assessment (including the determination of the amount of the penalty) shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Any insured credit union against which any penalty is assessed under this subsection shall be afforded an agency hearing if such insured credit union submits a request for such hearing within 20 days after the issuance of the notice of assessment. Section 1786(j) of this title shall apply to any proceeding under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Board may accept any report of condition made to any commission, board, or authority having supervision of a State-chartered credit union and may furnish to any such commission, board, or authority reports of condition made to the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Reports required under subchapter I of this chapter shall be so prepared that they can be used for share insurance purposes. To the maximum extent feasible, the Board shall use for insurance purposes reports submitted to State regulatory agencies by State-chartered credit unions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Audit requirement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the end of the 120-day period beginning on August 9, 1989, and notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, the Board shall prescribe, by regulation, audit standards which require an outside, independent audit of any insured credit union by a certified public accountant for any fiscal year (of such credit union)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for which such credit union has not conducted an annual supervisory committee audit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for which such credit union has not received a complete and satisfactory supervisory committee audit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) during which such credit union has experienced persistent and serious recordkeeping deficiencies, as determined by the Board.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Unsafe or unsound practice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board may treat the failure of any insured credit union to obtain an outside, independent audit for any fiscal year for which such audit is required under subparagraph (A) or (D) as an unsafe or unsound practice within the meaning of section 1786(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Accounting principles.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with the Board by each insured credit union shall be uniform and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Board determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Board determines that the application of any generally accepted accounting principle to any insured credit union is not appropriate, the Board may prescribe an accounting principle for application to the credit union that is no less stringent than generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>De minimus exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subparagraph shall not apply to any insured credit union, the total assets of which are less than $10,000,000, unless prescribed by the Board or an appropriate State credit union supervisor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Voluntary audits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a Federal credit union that is not required to conduct an audit under clause (i), and that has total assets of more than $10,000,000 conducts such an audit for any purpose, using an independent auditor who is compensated for his or her audit services with respect to that audit, the audit shall be performed consistent with the accountancy laws of the appropriate State or jurisdiction, including licensing requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Report to independent auditor.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each insured credit union which has engaged the services of an independent auditor to audit such depository institution within the past 2 years shall transmit to such auditor a copy of the most recent report of condition made by such credit union (pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law) and a copy of the most recent report of examination received by such credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Additional information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to the copies of the reports required to be provided to an auditor under subparagraph (A), each insured credit union shall provide such auditor with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a copy of any supervisory memorandum of understanding with such credit union and any written agreement between the Board or a State regulatory agency and the credit union which is in effect during the period covered by the audit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a report of any action initiated or taken by the Board during such period under subsection (e), (f), (g), (i), (<em>l</em>), or (q) of section 1786 of this title, or any similar action taken by a State regulatory agency under State law, or any other civil money penalty assessed by the Board under this chapter, with respect to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Statement required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each calendar year, in the case of an insured credit union with total assets of not more than $50,000,000, and for each semi-annual period in the case of an insured credit union with total assets of $50,000,000 or more, an insured credit union shall file with the Board, at such time as the Board prescribes, a certified statement showing the total amount of insured shares in the credit union at the close of the relevant period and both the amount of its deposit or adjustment of deposit and the amount of the insurance charge due to the Fund for that period, both as computed under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation; use of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby created in the Treasury of the United States a National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund which shall be used by the Board as a revolving fund for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter. Money in the fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, without fiscal year limitation, for making payments of insurance under section 1787 of this title, for providing assistance and making expenditures under section 1788 of this title in connection with the liquidation or threatened liquidation of insured credit unions, and for such administrative and other expenses incurred in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter as it may determine to be proper.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:873 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposit of deposits and premium charges, fees and penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All deposits and premium charges for insurance paid pursuant to the provisions of section 1782 of this title and all fees for examinations and all penalties collected by the Board under any provision of this subchapter shall be deposited in the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The Board shall report annually to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives with respect to the operating level of the fund. Such report shall also include the results of an independent audit of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Investment authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to invest and reinvest such portions of the fund as the Board may determine are not needed for current operations in any interest-bearing securities of the United States or in any securities guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States or in bonds or other obligations which are lawful investments for fiduciary, trust, and public funds of the United States, and the income therefrom shall constitute a part of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loans to fund, limitation and terms; interest accrual; determination of interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the judgment of the Board, a loan to the fund is required at any time for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall make the loan, but loans under this paragraph shall not exceed in the aggregate $100,000,000 outstanding at any one time. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and in subsection (e) of this section, each loan under this paragraph shall be made on such terms as may be fixed by agreement between the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Interest shall accrue to the Treasury on the amount of any outstanding loans made to the fund pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection on the basis of the average daily amount of such outstanding loans determined at the close of each fiscal year with respect to such year, and the Board shall pay the interest so accruing into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts annually from the fund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine the applicable interest rate in advance by calculating the average yield to maturity (on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations during the month of September of the preceding fiscal year) on outstanding marketable public debt obligations of the United States having a maturity date of five or less years from the first day of such month of September and by adjusting such yield to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of making loans under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to include such loans. All loans and repayments under this section shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Excess funds credited against loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">So long as any loans to the fund are outstanding, the Board shall from time to time, not less often than annually, determine whether the balance in the fund is in excess of the amount which, in its judgment, is needed to meet the requirements of the fund and shall pay such excess to the Secretary of the Treasury, to be credited against the loans to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization for fund to borrow from Central Liquidity Facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authority to borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury provided in subsection (d) of this section, if in the judgment of the Board, a loan to the fund is required at any time for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter, the fund is authorized to borrow from the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Examiners and claim agents; powers; report by examiner; jurisdiction of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall appoint examiners who shall have power, on its behalf, to examine any insured credit union, any credit union making application for insurance of its member accounts, or any closed insured credit union whenever in the judgment of the Board an examination is <!-- PDFPage:874 -->necessary to determine the condition of any such credit union for insurance purposes. Each examiner shall have power to make a thorough examination of all of the affairs of the credit union and shall make a full and detailed report of the condition of the credit union to the Board.

Such courts shall have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance with any such subpena.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Power of Board; jurisdiction of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with examinations of insured credit unions, or with other types of investigations to determine compliance with applicable law and regulations, the Board, or its designated representatives, shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to examine and to take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter in respect of the affairs of any such credit union, and to issue subpenas and subpenas duces tecum and to exercise such others&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1784_1_target" name="1784_1">1</a></sup> powers as are set forth in section 1786(p) of this title and, for the enforcement thereof, to apply to the United States district court for the judicial district or the United States Court in any territory in which the principal office of the credit union is located or in which the witness resides or carries on business.

Such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Board, or before a person designated by it, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or carries on business or wherever he may be found. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, or other papers in obedience to a subpena issued under the authority of this subchapter on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to penalty or forfeiture, but no individual shall be prosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Inapplicability of chapter upon conversion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon completion of a conversion described in subparagraph (A), the credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions of this chapter.</p>

The rules required by this clause shall provide that charter conversion by an insured credit union shall be subject to regulation that is no more or less restrictive than that applicable to charter conversions by other financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Oversight of member vote</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The member vote concerning charter conversion under this paragraph shall be administered by the Administration, and shall be verified by the Federal or State regulatory agency that would have jurisdiction over the institution after the conversion.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Termination of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any insured credit union other than a Federal credit union may, upon not less than ninety days&rsquo; written notice to the Board and upon the affirmative vote of a majority of its members within one year prior to the giving of such notice, terminate its status as an insured credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any insured credit union, other than a Federal credit union, which has obtained a new certificate of insurance from a corporation authorized and duly licensed to insure member accounts may upon not less than ninety days&rsquo; written notice to the Board convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That at the time of giving notice to the Board the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not being invoked against the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unsound condition of credit union; notice to correct condition; hearing; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union is engaging or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of such credit union, or is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured credit union, or is violating or has violated an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of <!-- PDFPage:879 -->any application or other request by the credit union, or is violating or has violated any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board shall serve upon the credit union a statement with respect to such practices or conditions or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof. In the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board shall send a copy of such statement to the commission, board, or authority, if any, having supervision of such credit union. Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty days after service of such statement, or within such shorter period of not less than twenty days after such service as the Board shall require in any case where it determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union could be unduly jeopardized by further delay in the correction of such practices or conditions or violations, or as the commission, board, or authority having supervision of such credit union, if any, shall require in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the credit union not less than thirty days&rsquo; written notice of its intention to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured credit union. Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe and unsound practices or conditions or violations and shall fix a time and place for a hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of the credit union. Unless the credit union shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured credit union. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or violation specified in the notice has been established and has not been corrected within the time above-prescribed in which to make such correction, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union an order terminating its status as an insured credit union on a date subsequent to the date of such finding and subsequent to the expiration of the time specified in the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any credit union whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to members of termination of insured status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of the termination of a credit union's status as an insured credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the credit union shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its members whose accounts are insured that it has ceased to be an insured credit union. It may include in such notice a statement of the fact that member accounts insured on the effective date of such termination, to the extent not withdrawn, remain insured for one year from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured credit union. In the event of failure to give the notice as herein provided to members whose accounts are insured, the Board is authorized to give reasonable notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Continuation of insurance for one year; approval of conversion of status; procedure subsequent to approval; reduction of premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After the termination of the insured status of any credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, insurance of its member accounts to the extent that they were insured on the effective date of such termination, less any amounts thereafter withdrawn which reduce the accounts below the amount covered by insurance on the effective date of such termination, shall continue for a period of one year, but no shares issued by the credit union or deposits made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Board. The credit union shall continue to maintain its deposit with and pay premiums to the Board during such period as in the case of an insured credit union and the Board shall have the right to examine such credit union from time to time during the period during which such insurance continues. Such credit union shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured credit union for the period of one year from the date of such termination. In the event that such credit union shall be closed for liquidation within such period of one year, the Board shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such credit union as in the case of an insured credit union. Notwithstanding the above, when an insured credit union's insured status is terminated and the credit union subsequently obtains comparable insurance coverage from another source, insurance of its accounts by the fund may cease immediately upon the effective date of such comparable coverage by mutual consent of the credit union and the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No credit union shall convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section until the proposition for such conversion has been approved by a majority of all the directors of the credit union, and by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who vote on the proposition in a vote in which at least 20 per centum of the total membership of the credit union participates. Following approval by the directors, written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the membership vote shall be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the records of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. The membership shall be given the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. If the proposition is approved by the membership, prompt and reasonable notice of insurance conversion shall be given to all members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event of a conversion of a credit union from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section, premium charges payable <!-- PDFPage:880 -->under section 1782(c) of this title shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the number of calendar months for which the converting credit union will no longer be insured under this chapter.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Opinion of Board as to unsound condition of credit union; notice of charges; hearing; order to cease and desist; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union, credit union which has insured accounts, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such credit union, or is violating or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the credit union or any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the credit union or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Board shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the credit union or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the credit union or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.</p>

Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (e)(3)(B) of this section.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans; purchase of assets; accounts; agreements affecting interest of Board in any asset acquired by it</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to reopen a closed insured credit union or in order to prevent the closing of an insured credit union which the Board has determined is in danger of closing or in order to assist in the voluntary liquidation of a solvent credit union, the Board, in its discretion, is authorized to make loans to, or purchase the assets of, or establish accounts in such insured credit union upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe. Except with respect to the voluntary liquidation of a solvent credit union, such loans shall be made and such accounts shall be established only when, in the opinion of the Board, such action is necessary to protect the fund or the interests of the members of the credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever in the judgment of the Board such action will reduce the risk or avert a threatened loss to the fund and will facilitate a merger or consolidation of an insured credit union with another insured credit union, or will facilitate the sale of the assets of an open or closed insured credit union to and assumption of its liability by another person, the Board may, upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, make loans secured in whole or in part by assets of an open or closed insured credit union, which loans may be in subordination to the rights of members and creditors of such credit union, or the Board may purchase any of such assets or may guarantee any person against loss by reason of its assuming the liabilities and purchasing the assets of an open or closed insured credit union. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means any credit union, individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the right, title, or interest of the Board, in any asset acquired by it under this subsection, either as security for a loan or by purchase, shall be valid against the Board unless such agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be in writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall have been executed by the credit union and the person or persons claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the credit union;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall have been approved by the board of directors of the credit union, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of such board; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall have been continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the protection of the Fund, the Board, without regard to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) deal with, complete, reconstruct, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts for the management of, sell for cash or credit, or lease, in its discretion, any real property acquired or held by it under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of, any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by it under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Section 5 of title 41 shall not apply to any purchase or contract for services or supplies made or entered into by the Board under this section if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000, or to any contract for hazard insurance on any real property acquired or held by it under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Employees of credit unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No insured credit union may discharge or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee (or any person acting pursuant to the request of the employee) provided information to the Board or the Attorney General regarding any possible violation of any law or regulation by the credit union or any director, officer, or employee of the credit union.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay compensatory damages, or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Resolving problems to protect Fund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is to resolve the problems of insured credit unions at the least possible long-term loss to the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prompt corrective action required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall carry out the purpose of this section by taking prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured credit unions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Insured credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action for insured credit unions that is&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:912 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) consistent with this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) comparable to section 1831<em>o</em> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cooperative character of credit unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall design the system required under subparagraph (A) to take into account that credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) do not issue capital stock;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) must rely on retained earnings to build net worth; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) have boards of directors that consist primarily of volunteers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) New credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to regulations under paragraph (1), the Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action that shall apply to new credit unions in lieu of this section and the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Criteria for alternative system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall design the system prescribed under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to carry out the purpose of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to recognize that credit unions (as cooperatives that do not issue capital stock) initially have no net worth, and give new credit unions reasonable time to accumulate net worth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to create adequate incentives for new credit unions to become adequately capitalized by the time that they either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) have been in operation for more than 10 years; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) have more than $10,000,000 in total assets;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to impose appropriate restrictions and requirements on new credit unions that do not make sufficient progress toward becoming adequately capitalized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) to prevent evasion of the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Net worth categories</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Well capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &ldquo;well capitalized&rdquo; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 7 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adequately capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &ldquo;adequately capitalized&rdquo; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 6 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &ldquo;undercapitalized&rdquo; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it fails to meet any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Significantly undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &ldquo;significantly undercapitalized&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if it has a net worth ratio of less than 4 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it has a net worth ratio of less than 5 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under subsection (f) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan accepted by the Board.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Critically undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &ldquo;critically undercapitalized&rdquo; if it has a net worth ratio of less than 2 percent (or such higher net worth ratio, not to exceed 3 percent, as the Board may specify by regulation).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjusting net worth levels</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, for purposes of section 1831<em>o</em>(c) of this title, the Federal banking agencies increase or decrease the required minimum level for the leverage limit (as those terms are used in section 1831<em>o</em> of this title), the Board may, by regulation, and subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, correspondingly increase or decrease 1 or more of the net worth ratios specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in an amount that is equal to not more than the difference between the required minimum level most recently established by the Federal banking agencies and 4 percent of total assets (with respect to institutions regulated by those agencies).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may increase or decrease net worth ratios under subparagraph (A) only if the Board&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determines, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies, that the reason for the increase or decrease in the required minimum level for the leverage limit also justifies the adjustment in net worth ratios; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determines that the resulting net worth ratios are sufficient to carry out the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Transition period required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board increases any net worth ratio under this paragraph, the Board shall give insured credit unions a reasonable period of time to meet the increased ratio.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Risk-based net worth requirement for complex credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations required under subsection (b)(1) of this section shall include a risk-based <!-- PDFPage:913 -->net worth requirement for insured credit unions that are complex, as defined by the Board based on the portfolios of assets and liabilities of credit unions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall design the risk-based net worth requirement to take account of any material risks against which the net worth ratio required for an insured credit union to be adequately capitalized may not provide adequate protection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Earnings-retention requirement applicable to credit unions that are not well capitalized</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An insured credit union that is not well capitalized shall annually set aside as net worth an amount equal to not less than 0.4 percent of its total assets.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Board's authority to decrease earnings-retention requirement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may, by order, decrease the 0.4 percent requirement in paragraph (1) with respect to a credit union to the extent that the Board determines that the decrease&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) would further the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Periodic review required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall periodically review any order issued under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Net worth restoration plan required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan to the Board within the time allowed under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Assistance to small credit unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board (or the staff of the Board) shall, upon timely request by an insured credit union with total assets of less than $10,000,000, and subject to such regulations or guidelines as the Board may prescribe, assist that credit union in preparing a net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deadlines for submission and review of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall, by regulation, establish deadlines for submission of net worth restoration plans under this subsection that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide insured credit unions with reasonable time to submit net worth restoration plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require the Board to act on net worth restoration plans expeditiously.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to submit acceptable plan within time allowed</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Failure to submit any plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an insured credit union fails to submit a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) promptly notify the credit union of that failure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Submission of unacceptable plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an insured credit union submits a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), and the Board determines that the plan is not acceptable, the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) promptly notify the credit union of why the plan is not acceptable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a revised plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Accepting plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may accept a net worth restoration plan only if the Board determines that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the net worth of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Restrictions on undercapitalized credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Restriction on asset growth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall not generally permit its average total assets to increase, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board has accepted the net worth restoration plan of the credit union for that action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any increase in total assets is consistent with the net worth restoration plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the net worth ratio of the credit union increases at a rate that is consistent with the net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Restriction on member business loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1757a(a) of this title, an insured credit union that is undercapitalized may not make any increase in the total amount of member business loans (as defined in section 1757a(c) of this title) outstanding at that credit union at any one time, until such time as the credit union becomes adequately capitalized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) More stringent treatment based on other supervisory criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the exercise of authority by the Board under regulations comparable to section 1831<em>o</em>(g) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Board may not reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category, or treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category, for reasons not pertaining to the safety and soundness of that credit union; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Board may not delegate its authority to reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category or to treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Action required regarding critically undercapitalized credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall, not later than 90 days after the date on which an insured credit union becomes critically undercapitalized&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) appoint a conservator or liquidating agent for the credit union; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:914 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take such other action as the Board determines would better achieve the purpose of this section, after documenting why the action would better achieve that purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Periodic redeterminations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any determination by the Board under paragraph (1)(B) to take any action with respect to an insured credit union in lieu of appointing a conservator or liquidating agent shall cease to be effective not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the determination is made, and a conservator or liquidating agent shall be appointed for that credit union under paragraph (1)(A), unless the Board makes a new determination under paragraph (1)(B) before the end of the effective period of the prior determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appointment of liquidating agent required if other action fails to restore net worth</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Board shall appoint a liquidating agent for an insured credit union if the credit union is critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning 18 months after the date on which the credit union became critically undercapitalized.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board may continue to take such other action as the Board determines to be appropriate in lieu of appointment of a liquidating agent if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Board determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the insured credit union has been in substantial compliance with an approved net worth restoration plan that requires consistent improvement in the net worth of the credit union since the date of the approval of the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the insured credit union has positive net income or has an upward trend in earnings that the Board projects as sustainable; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Board certifies that the credit union is viable and not expected to fail.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Nondelegation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Board may not delegate the authority of the Board under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may delegate the authority of the Board under this subsection with respect to an insured credit union that has less than $5,000,000 in total assets, if the Board permits the credit union to appeal any adverse action to the Board.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Review required when Fund incurs material loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining whether the Fund has incurred a material loss with respect to an insured credit union (such that the inspector general of the Board must make a report), a loss is material if it exceeds the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $10,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount equal to 10 percent of the total assets of the credit union at the time at which the Board initiated assistance under section 1788 of this title or was appointed liquidating agent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Appeals process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Material supervisory determinations, including decisions to require prompt corrective action, made pursuant to this section by Administration officials other than the Board may be appealed to the Board pursuant to the independent appellate process required by section 4806 of this title (or, if the Board so specifies, pursuant to separate procedures prescribed by regulation).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Consultation and cooperation with State credit union supervisors</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In implementing this section, the Board shall consult and seek to work cooperatively with State officials having jurisdiction over State-chartered insured credit unions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Evaluating net worth restoration plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating any net worth restoration plan submitted by a State-chartered insured credit union, the Board shall seek the views of the State official having jurisdiction over the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deciding whether to appoint conservator or liquidating agent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to any decision by the Board on whether to appoint a conservator or liquidating agent for a State-chartered insured credit union&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board shall&mdash;</p>
