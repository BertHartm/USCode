<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conveyance, sale, and assignment by mortgagee; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure; direct conveyances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under section 1709 of this title shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by the Secretary, or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. The Secretary is also authorized, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, to make the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided available to the mortgagee, notwithstanding any provision of this section requiring conveyance of title to the property to the Secretary, (1)(A) upon sale of the insured property at foreclosure, where such sale is for at least the fair market value of the property (with appropriate adjustments), as determined by the Secretary, or (B) upon the sale of the insured property by the mortgagor after default, if (i) the sale has been approved by the Secretary, (ii) the mortgagee receives an amount at least equal to the fair market value of the property (with appropriate adjustments), as determined by the Secretary, and (iii) the mortgagor has received appropriate homeownership counseling, as determined by the Secretary; and (2) upon the assignment to the Secretary of all claims referred to in clause (2) of the preceding sentence. The payment of benefits under the preceding sentence may be made for any mortgage insured pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or after November 30, 1983 (on or after November 7, 1988, with respect to the payment of benefits under clause (1)(B) of the preceding sentence), and, with the approval of the mortgagee, for any mortgage insured pursuant to a commitment issued before that date. As a condition of the receipt of such benefits, the mortgagee shall maintain or assure the maintenance of the mortgaged property (in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulation provide) during the period beginning on the taking of the possession or other acquisition of the mortgaged property by the mortgagee and ending on conveyance to the Secretary or other disposition of the mortgaged property in accordance with this section, and funds expended by the mortgagee in meeting such obligation shall be included, to the extent provided in this subsection or in subsection (k) of this section, in debentures or other insurance payment pursuant to this section. Upon the conveyance and assignment referred to in the first sentence of this section or the sale and assignment referred to in the second sentence of this subsection, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee debentures having a par value equal to the value of the mortgage and (subject to subsection (e)(2) of this section) a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure the amount of all payments which have been made by the mortgagee for taxes, ground rents, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage, special assessments which are noted <!-- PDFPage:546 -->on the application for insurance or which become liens after the insurance of the mortgage, charges for the administration, operation, maintenance and repair of community-owned property or the maintenance and repair of the mortgaged property, the obligation for which arises out of a covenant filed for record and approved by the Secretary prior to the insurance of the mortgage, insurance on the mortgaged property, and any mortgage insurance premiums, and any tax imposed by the United States upon any deed or other instrument by which said property was acquired by the mortgagee and transferred or conveyed to the Secretary and by deducting from such total amount any amount received on account of the mortgage after either of such dates, any amount received as rent or other income from the property, less reasonable expenses incurred in handling the property, after either of such dates, and, in the case of insurance benefits paid in accordance with the second sentence of this section, any amount received upon the sale of the property: <em>Provided</em>, That with respect to mortgages which are accepted for insurance under section 203(b)(2)(B) of this Act, and which are foreclosed before there shall have been paid on account of the principal obligation of the mortgage a sum equal to 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage was accepted for insurance, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary, on account of foreclosure costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount not in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, but in no event in excess of $75: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to mortgages which are accepted for insurance under section 203(b)(2)(D) of this Act or under the second proviso of section 1713(c)(2) of this title, or under section 1715e of this title, or with respect to any mortgage accepted for insurance under section 1709 of this title on or after August 2, 1954, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary on account of the cost of foreclosure (or of acquiring the property by other means) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount, not in excess of two-thirds of such cost or $75 whichever is the greater: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to a mortgage accepted for insurance pursuant to a commitment issued on or after September 2, 1964, the Secretary may include in debentures or in the cash payment an amount not to exceed the foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to a mortgage accepted for insurance pursuant to a commitment issued prior to September 2, 1964, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e) of this section), include in debentures or in the cash payment, in addition to amounts otherwise allowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 532 and 536 of the Appendix to title 50 apply, and which are insured under section 1709 of this title, and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter: <em>And provided further</em>, That where the claim is paid in cash there shall be included in the cash payment an amount equivalent to the compensation for loss of debenture interest that would be included in computing debentures if such claim were being paid in debentures: <em>And provided further</em>, That with respect to any mortgage covering a one-, two-, three-, or four-family residence insured under this chapter, if the Secretary finds, after notice of default, that the default was due to circumstances beyond the control of the mortgagor, he may, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, (1) approve the request of the mortgagee for an extension of the time for the curing of the default and of the time for commencing foreclosure proceedings or for otherwise acquiring title to the mortgaged property to such time as the Secretary may determine is necessary and desirable to enable the mortgagor to complete the mortgage payments, including an extension of time beyond the stated maturity of the mortgage, and in the event of a subsequent foreclosure or acquisition of the property by other means the Secretary is authorized to include in the debentures an amount equal to any unpaid mortgage interest, or (2) approve a modification of the terms of the mortgage for the purpose of changing the amortization provisions by recasting, over the remaining term of the mortgage or over such longer period as may be approved by the Secretary, the total unpaid amount then due, as determined by the Secretary, with the modification to become effective currently or to become effective upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of the period for curing the default; and the principal amount of the mortgage, as modified, shall be considered to be the &ldquo;original principal obligation of the mortgage&rdquo; as that term is used in this chapter for the purpose of computing the total face value of the debentures to be issued or the cash payment to be made by the Secretary to a mortgagee: <em>And provided further</em>, That, notwithstanding any requirement contained in this chapter that debentures may be issued only upon acquisition of title and possession by the mortgagee and its subsequent conveyance and transfer to the Secretary, and for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary conveyance expense in connection with payment of insurance benefits under the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized, subject to such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to permit the mortgagee to tender to the Secretary a satisfactory conveyance of title and transfer of possession direct from <!-- PDFPage:547 -->the mortgagor or other appropriate grantor and to pay the insurance benefits to the mortgagee which it would otherwise be entitled to if such conveyance had been made to the mortgagee and from the mortgagee to the Secretary: <em>And provided further</em>, That the Secretary may pay insurance benefits to the mortgagee to recompense the mortgagee for its actions to provide an alternative to the foreclosure of a mortgage that is in default, which actions may include special forebearance, loan modification, and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, all upon terms and conditions as the mortgagee shall determine in the mortgagee's sole discretion, within guidelines provided by the Secretary, but which may not include assignment of a mortgage to the Secretary: <em>And provided further</em>, That for purposes of the preceding proviso, no action authorized by the Secretary and no action taken, nor any failure to act, by the Secretary or the mortgagee shall be subject to judicial review..<sup><a href="#1710_1_target" name="1710_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consent to release of mortgagor or property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Debentures; form and amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be in such form and amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be subject to such terms and conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may be in book entry or certificated registered form, or such other form as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may prescribe in regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Debentures; issuance; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The debentures issued under this section to any mortagee&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1710_2_target" name="1710_2">2</a></sup> with respect to mortgages insured under section 1709 of this title shall be issued in the name of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund as obligor and shall be negotiable, and, if in book entry form, transferable, in the manner described by the Secretary in regulations. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default: <em>Provided</em>, That debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715<em>o</em> of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages insured under section 1709 or section 1713 of this title prior to February 3, 1938 shall be subject only to such Federal, State, and local taxes as the mortgages in exchange for which they are issued would be subject to in the hands of the holder of the debentures and shall be a liability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, but such debentures shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; but any mortgagee entitled to receive any such debentures may elect to receive in lieu thereof a cash adjustment and debentures issued as hereinafter provided and bearing the current rate of interest. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by the mortgages insured after February 3, 1938, shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority; and such debentures shall be paid out of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event that the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures issued under this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Certificate of claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, at the time of the conveyance to the Secretary of the property covered by the mortgage, the mortgagor had redeemed the property and paid in full all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. The amount to which the holder of any such certificate shall be entitled shall be determined as provided in subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A certificate of claim shall not be issued and the provisions of paragraph (1) of this sub<!-- PDFPage:548 -->section shall not be applicable in the case of a mortgage accepted for insurance pursuant to a commitment issued on or after September 2, 1964.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Division of excess proceeds; settlement of certificates of claims and refunds to mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, after deducting (in such manner and amount as the Secretary shall determine to be equitable and in accordance with sound accounting practice) the expenses incurred by the Secretary, the net amount realized from any property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and the claims assigned therewith exceed the face value of the debentures issued and the cash paid in exchange for such property plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be paid to the mortgagor of such property if the mortgage was insured under section 1709 of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That on and after September 2, 1964, any excess remaining after payment to the holder of the full amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest increment thereon, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to commitments for insurance issued after August 11, 1955, and, with the consent of the mortgagee or mortgagor, as the case may be, with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to commitments issued prior to such date, to effect the settlement of certificates of claim and refunds to mortgagors at any time after the sale or transfer of title to the property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and without awaiting the final liquidation of such property for the purpose of determining the net amount to be realized therefrom: <em>Provided</em>, That the settlement authority created by the Housing Amendments of 1955 shall be terminated with respect to any certificates of claim outstanding as of September 2, 1964.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With the consent of the holder thereof, the Secretary is authorized, without awaiting the final liquidation of the Secretary's interest in the property, to settle any certificate of claim issued pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, with respect to which settlement had not been effected prior to September 2, 1964, by making payment in cash to the holder thereof of such amount not exceeding the face amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest thereon, as the Secretary may consider appropriate: <em>Provided</em>, That in any case where the certificate of claim is settled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, any amounts realized after September 2, 1964, in the liquidation of the Secretary's interest in the property, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power to deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, or sell for cash or credit, in his discretion, any properties conveyed to him in exchange for debentures and certificates of claim as provided in this section; and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against mortgagors assigned by mortgagees to the Secretary as provided in this section: <em>Provided</em>, That section 5 of title 41 shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The Secretary shall, by regulation, carry out a program of sales of such properties and shall develop and implement appropriate credit terms and standards to be used in carrying out the program. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real or personal property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint: <em>And provided further</em>, That a conveyance or transfer of title to real or personal property or an interest therein to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, his successors and assigns, without identifying the Secretary therein, shall be deemed a proper conveyance or transfer to the same extent and of like effect as if the Secretary were personally named in such conveyance or transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Mortgagor's or mortgagee's interest in property or claim conveyed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgagee or mortgagor shall have, and no certificate of claim shall be construed to give to any mortgagee or mortgagor, any right or interest in any property conveyed to the Secretary or in any claim assigned to him; nor shall the Secretary owe any duty to any mortgagee or mortgagor with respect to the handling or disposal of any such property or the collection of any such claim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1710_3_target" name="1710_3">3</a></sup> Foreclosure; payment and cessation of obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that any mortgagee under a mortgage insured under section 1709 of this title <!-- PDFPage:549 -->(other than a mortgagee receiving insurance benefits under clause (1)(A) of the second sentence of subsection (a) of this section) forecloses on the mortgaged property but does not convey such property to the Secretary in accordance with this section, and the Secretary is given written notice thereof, or in the event that the mortgagor pays the obligation under the mortgage in full prior to the maturity thereof, and the mortgagee pays any adjusted premium charge required under the provisions of section 1709(c) of this title, and the Secretary is given written notice by the mortgagee of the payment of such obligation, the obligation to pay any subsequent premium charge for insurance shall cease, and all rights of the mortgagee and the mortgagor under this section shall terminate as of the date of such notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Debentures; inclusion of payments and taxes; termination of obligation to pay premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of section 1739 or 1750c of this title and with respect to any debentures issued in exchange for properties conveyed to and accepted by the Secretary after September 23, 1959 in accordance with such sections, the Secretary may (1) include in debentures reasonable payments made by the mortgagee with the approval of the Secretary for the purpose of protecting, operating, or preserving the property, and taxes imposed upon any deed or any other instrument by which the property was acquired by the mortgagee and transferred or conveyed to the Secretary; (2) include in debentures as a portion of foreclosure costs (to the extent that foreclosure costs may be included in such debentures by any other provision of this chapter) payments made by the mortgagee for the cost of acquiring the property and conveying and evidencing title to the property to the Secretary; and (3) terminate the mortgagee's obligation to pay mortgage insurance premiums upon receipt of an application for debentures filed by the mortgagee, or in the event the contract of insurance is terminated pursuant to section 1715t of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Nullification of right of redemption of single family mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Secretary or a contract mortgagee (pursuant to its contract with the Secretary) forecloses on a Secretary-held single family mortgage in any Federal or State court or pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage, the purchaser at the foreclosure sale shall be entitled to receive a conveyance of title to, and possession of, the property, subject to the interests senior to the interests of the Secretary or the contract mortgagee, as the case may be. Notwithstanding any State law to the contrary, there shall be no right of redemption (including in all instances any right to possession based upon any right of redemption) in the mortgagor or any other person subsequent to the foreclosure sale in connection with a Secretary-held single family mortgage. The appropriate State official or the trustee, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver a deed or other appropriate instrument conveying title to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, consistent with applicable procedures in the jurisdiction and without regard to any such right of redemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The following actions shall be taken in order to verify title in the purchaser at the foreclosure sale:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of a judicial foreclosure in any Federal or State court, there shall be included in the petition and in the judgment of foreclosure a statement that the foreclosure is in accordance with this subsection and that there is no right of redemption in the mortgagor or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;Secretary-held single family mortgage&rdquo; means a single-family mortgage held by the Secretary or by a contract mortgagee at the time of initiation of foreclosure that&mdash;</p>
