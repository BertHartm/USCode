The aggregate number of mortgages insured under this section in any administrative region of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in any fiscal year may not exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter in such region during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) One- to four-family dwellings; requirements for private mortgage insurance companies</h4>

Pursuant to a contract under this section, a private mortgage insurance company shall endorse loans for insurance and take such other actions on behalf of the Secretary and in the Secretary's name as the Secretary may authorize.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgages offered for inclusion by Secretary</h4>
