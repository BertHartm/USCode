The system shall be implemented before the end of the 1-year period beginning on July 30, 2008.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Registration requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In connection with the registration of any loan originator under this subsection, the appropriate Federal banking agency and the Farm Credit Administration shall, at a minimum, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and <!-- PDFPage:1699 -->Registry information concerning the employees's&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5106_1_target" name="5106_1">1</a></sup> identity, including&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Unique identifier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal banking agencies, through the Financial Institutions Examination Council, and the Farm Credit Administration shall coordinate with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to establish protocols for assigning a unique identifier to each registered loan originator that will facilitate electronic tracking and uniform identification of, and public access to, the employment history of and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To facilitate the transfer of information required by subsection (a)(2), the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry shall coordinate with the Federal banking agencies, through the Financial Institutions Examination Council, and the Farm Credit Administration concerning the development and operation, by such System and Registry, of the registration functionality and data requirements for loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consideration of factors and procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing the registration procedures under subsection (a) and the protocols for assigning a unique identifier to a registered loan originator, the Federal banking agencies shall make such de minimis exceptions as may be appropriate to paragraphs (1)(A) and (2) of section 5103(a) of this title, shall make reasonable efforts to utilize existing information to minimize the burden of registering loan originators, and shall consider methods for automating the process to the greatest extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>
