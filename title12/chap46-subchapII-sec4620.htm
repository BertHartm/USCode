<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations by Director</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A conservator shall be subject to any rules, regulations, and orders issued from time to time by the Director and, except as otherwise specifically provided in such rules, regulations, or orders or in section 4621 of this title, shall have the same rights and privileges and be subject to the same duties, restrictions, penalties, conditions, and limitations applicable to directors, officers, or employees of the enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement of contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A conservator may enforce any contract described in paragraph (2), notwithstanding any provision of the contract providing for the termination, default, acceleration, or other exercise of rights upon, or solely by reason of, the insolvency of the enterprise or the appointment of a conservator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Enforceable contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any contract that is within a class of contracts shall be enforceable under paragraph (1) if the Director&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that the continued enforceability of such class of contracts is necessary to achieve the purpose of the conservatorship; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) specifically provides for the enforceability of such class of contracts in a regulation or order, issued for the purpose of this subsection, which describes such class.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection and any regulation or order issued under this subsection shall apply only to contracts entered into, modified, extended, or renewed after the effective date of the regulation or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Stays</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 45 days after appointment pursuant to section 4616, 4617, or 4619 of this title, or 45 days after receipt of actual notice of an action or proceeding that is pending at the time of appointment, a conservator may request that any judicial action or proceeding to which the conservator or the enterprise is or may become a party be stayed for a period not exceeding 45 days after the request. Upon petition, the court shall grant such stay as to all parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Federal agency as conservator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which the conservator appointed for an enterprise is a Federal agency or an officer or employee of the Federal Government, the conservator may make a request for a stay under paragraph (1) only with the prior consent of the Attorney General and subject to the direction and control of the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of creditors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A conservator and professional employees (other than Federal employees) appointed to represent or assist the conservator may be compensated for activities conducted as conservator. Compensation may not be provided in amounts greater than the compensation paid to employees of the Federal Government for similar services, except that the Director may provide for compensation at higher rates (but not in excess of rates prevailing in the private sector), if the Director determines that compensation at higher rates is necessary in order to recruit and retain competent personnel.</p>
