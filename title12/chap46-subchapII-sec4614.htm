<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Adequately capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enterprise shall be classified as adequately capitalized if the enterprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) maintains an amount of total capital that is equal to or exceeds the risk-based capital level established for the enterprise under section 4611 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) maintains an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the minimum capital level established for the enterprise under section 4612 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enterprise shall be classified as undercapitalized if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the enterprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not maintain an amount of total capital that is equal to or exceeds the risk-based capital level established for the enterprise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) maintains an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the minimum capital level established for the enterprise; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the enterprise is otherwise classified as undercapitalized under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Significantly undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enterprise shall be classified as significantly undercapitalized if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the enterprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not maintain an amount of total capital that is equal to or exceeds the risk-based capital level established for the enterprise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not maintain an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the minimum capital level established for the enterprise; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Critically undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enterprise shall be classified as critically undercapitalized if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discretionary classification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If at any time the Director determines in writing that an enterprise is engaging in conduct not approved by the Director that could result in a rapid depletion of core capital or that the value of the property subject to mortgages held or securitized by the enterprise has decreased <!-- PDFPage:1555 -->significantly, the Director may classify the enterprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as undercapitalized, if the enterprise is otherwise classified as adequately capitalized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as significantly undercapitalized, if the enterprise is otherwise classified as undercapitalized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) as critically undercapitalized, if the enterprise is otherwise classified as significantly undercapitalized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Quarterly determination</h4>
