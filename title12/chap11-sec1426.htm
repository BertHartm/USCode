<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Capital standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 18 months after November 12, 1999, the Finance Board shall issue regulations prescribing uniform capital standards applicable to each Federal home loan bank, which shall require each such bank to meet&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the leverage requirement specified in paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the risk-based capital requirements, in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Leverage requirement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The leverage requirement shall require each Federal home loan bank to maintain a minimum amount of total capital based on the total assets of the bank and shall be 5 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of stock and retained earnings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining compliance with the minimum leverage ratio established under subparagraph (A), the paid-in value of the outstanding Class B stock and the amount of retained earnings shall be multiplied by 1.5, <!-- PDFPage:263 -->and such higher amounts shall be deemed to be capital for purposes of meeting the 5 percent minimum leverage ratio, except that a Federal home loan bank's total capital (determined without taking into account any such multiplier) shall not be less than 4 percent of the total assets of the bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Risk-based capital standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each Federal home loan bank shall maintain permanent capital in an amount that is sufficient, as determined in accordance with the regulations of the Finance Board, to meet&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the credit risk to which the Federal home loan bank is subject; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the market risk, including interest rate risk, to which the Federal home loan bank is subject, based on a stress test established by the Finance Board that rigorously tests for changes in market variables, including changes in interest rates, rate volatility, and changes in the shape of the yield curve.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consideration of other risk-based standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the risk-based standard under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Finance Board shall take due consideration of any risk-based capital test established pursuant to section 1361 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4611) for the enterprises (as defined in that Act [12 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.]), with such modifications as the Finance Board determines to be appropriate to reflect differences in operations between the Federal home loan banks and those enterprises.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other regulatory requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued by the Finance Board under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) permit each Federal home loan bank to issue, with such rights, terms, and preferences, not inconsistent with this chapter and the regulations issued hereunder, as the board of directors of that bank may approve, any 1 or more of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Class A stock, which shall be redeemable in cash and at par 6 months following submission by a member of a written notice of its intent to redeem such shares; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Class B stock, which shall be redeemable in cash and at par 5 years following submission by a member of a written notice of its intent to redeem such shares;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide that the stock of a Federal home loan bank may be issued to and held by only members of the bank, and that a bank may not issue any stock other than as provided in this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) prescribe the manner in which stock of a Federal home loan bank may be sold, transferred, redeemed, or repurchased; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) provide the manner of disposition of outstanding stock held by, and the liquidation of any claims of the Federal home loan bank against, an institution that ceases to be a member of the bank, through merger or otherwise, or that provides notice of intention to withdraw from membership in the bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definitions of capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining compliance with the capital standards established under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) permanent capital of a Federal home loan bank shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The capital structure plan of each Federal home loan bank shall impose a continuing obligation on the board of directors of the bank to review and adjust the minimum investment required of each member of that bank, as necessary to ensure that the bank remains in compliance with applicable minimum capital levels established by the Finance Board, and shall require each member to comply promptly with any adjustments to the required minimum investment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The capital structure plan of a Federal home loan bank may allow any member referred to in subparagraph (A) that would be required by the terms of the capital structure plan to increase its investment in the stock of the bank to do so in periodic installments during the transition period.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Excess stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Shares of stock held by a member shall not be deemed to be &ldquo;excess stock&rdquo; for purposes of this subsection by virtue of a member's submission of a notice of intent to withdraw from membership or termination of its membership in any other manner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Federal home loan bank may not redeem any excess Class B stock prior to the end of the 5-year notice period, unless the member has no Class A stock outstanding that could be redeemed as excess.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Impairment of capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Finance Board or the board of directors of a Federal home loan bank determines that the bank has incurred or is likely to incur losses that result in or are expected to result in charges against the capital of the bank, the bank shall not redeem or repurchase any stock of the bank without the prior approval of the Finance Board while such charges are continuing or are expected to continue.
