<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Review of market availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall conduct a continuing review of the market availability situation in each of the several States to determine whether crime insurance is available at affordable rates either through the normal insurance market or through a suitable program adopted under State law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Government crime insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon determining pursuant to subsection (a) of this section that, at any time on or after August 1, 1971, a critical market unavailability situation for crime insurance then exists in any State and has not been met through appropriate State action, the Director is authorized to make crime insurance available at affordable rates within such State through the facilities of the Federal Government. Such insurance shall be provided upon such terms and conditions, and subject to such deductibles and other restrictions and limitations, as the Director deems appropriate, but no such insurance shall be made available to a property which the Director determines to be uninsurable or to a property with respect to which reasonable protective measures to prevent loss, consistent with standards established by the Director, have not been adopted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, direct insurance may be continued for the term of the policies written prior to the date of termination of the Director's direct insurance authority under this part, for as long as the insured pays the required direct insurance premiums; except that direct insurance under this part for any risk shall be terminated after notice whenever the Director determines that the standard lines of crime insurance otherwise have become available to such property at affordable rates.</p>
