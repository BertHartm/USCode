<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) small business concerns are a vital part of the economy, accounting for the majority of new jobs, new products, and new services created in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adequate access to debt capital is a critical component for small business development, productivity, expansion, and success in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) commercial banks are the most important suppliers of debt capital to small business concerns in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) commercial banks and other depository institutions have various incentives to minimize their risk in financing small business concerns;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) as a result of such incentives, many small business concerns with economically sound financing needs are unable to obtain access to needed debt capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the small business capital access programs implemented by certain States are a flexible and efficient tool to assist financial institutions in providing access to needed debt capital for many small business concerns in a manner consistent with safety and soundness regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a small business capital access program would complement other programs which assist small business concerns in obtaining access to capital; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Federal policy can stimulate and accelerate efforts by States to implement small busi<!-- PDFPage:1582 -->ness capital access programs by providing an incentive to States, while leaving the administration of such programs to each participating State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">By encouraging States to implement administratively efficient capital access programs that encourage commercial banks and other depository institutions to provide access to debt capital for a broad portfolio of small business concerns, and thereby promote a more efficient and effective debt market, the purposes of this subchapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to promote economic opportunity and growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to create jobs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to promote economic efficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance productivity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to spur innovation.</p>
