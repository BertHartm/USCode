<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) New nonaccrual loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after a loan made by a certified lender is placed in nonaccrual status, the lender shall determine whether to restructure the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special asset groups</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 30 days after a qualified lender in a district is certified to issue preferred stock under section 2278b&ndash;7 of this title, the Farm Credit Bank board shall establish a special asset group that shall review each determination by the lender not to restructure a loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Restructuring plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a special asset group determines under paragraph (1) that a loan under review should be restructured, the group shall prescribe a restructuring plan for the loan that the qualified lender shall implement.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the National Special Asset Council determines that any special asset group is not in substantial compliance with this section, the Council shall notify the group of the determination, and may take such other action as the Council considers necessary to ensure that such group complies with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Restructuring factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether a loan is to be restructured, the National Special Asset Council, each special asset group, and each qualified lender certified under section 2278a&ndash;4 of this title shall take into consideration the factors specified in section 2202a(d)(1) of this title.</p>
