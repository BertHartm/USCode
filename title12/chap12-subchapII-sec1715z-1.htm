<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic interest reduction payments&nbsp; on&nbsp; behalf&nbsp; of&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; rental&nbsp; housing project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of reducing rentals for lower income families, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed for occupancy by lower income families, which shall be accomplished through payments to morgagees&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_1_target" name="1715z-1_1">1</a></sup> holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restrictions on payments; payments with respect to projects financed under State or local programs; mortgage insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest reduction payments with respect to a project shall only be made during such time as the project is operated as a rental housing project and is subject to a mortgage which meets the requirements of, and is insured under, subsection (j) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such interest reduction payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary: <em>Provided further</em>, That interest reduction payments may be made with respect to a mortgage or part thereof on a rental or cooperative housing project owned by a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend entity, public&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_2_target" name="1715z-1_2">2</a></sup> entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. The term <!-- PDFPage:640 -->&ldquo;mortgage insurance premium&rdquo;, when used in this section in relation to a project financed by a loan under a State or local program, means such fees and charges, approved by the Secretary, as are payable by the mortgagor to the State or local agency mortgagee to meet reserve requirements and administrative expenses of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest reduction payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a project owner shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the project owner as a mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such project owner would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgage handling expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (c) of this section, as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of project in accordance with requirements respecting tenant eligibility and rents prescribed by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As a condition for receiving the benefits of interest reduction payments, the project owner shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe. Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for review of tenant incomes at intervals of one year (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Establishment of basic and fair market rental charges; rental for dwelling units; separate utility metering; additional assistance payments for low-income tenants; limitations; amounts; approval of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For each dwelling unit there shall be established with the approval of the Secretary (A) a basic rental charge determined on the basis of operating the project with payments of principal and interest due under a mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum; and (B) a fair market rental charge determined on the basis of operating the project with payments of principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage covering the project. The rental for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the fair market rental charge, as represents 30 per centum of the tenant's adjusted income. With respect to those projects which the Secretary determines have separate utility metering for some or all dwelling units, the Secretary is authorized&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to permit the basic rental charge and the fair market rental charge to be determined on the basis of operating the project without the payment of the cost of utility services used by such dwelling units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to permit the charging of a rental for such dwelling units at such an amount less than 30 per centum of a tenant's adjusted income as the Secretary determines represents a proportionate decrease for the utility charges to be paid by such tenant, but in no case shall such rental be lower than 25 per centum of a tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any project made subject to a contract under this section after August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall make, and contract to make, additional assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of tenants whose incomes are too low for them to afford the basic rentals (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) with 30 per centum of their adjusted income. The additional assistance payments authorized by this paragraph with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the amount required to reduce the rental payment (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) by the tenant to the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 30 per centum of the tenant's monthly adjusted income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 10 per centum of the tenant's monthly income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the family's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary to assure the economic viability of the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary and feasible in order to, assure, insofar as is practicable, that there is in the project a reasonable range in the income levels of tenants, or that such action is to be taken to meet the housing needs of elderly or handicapped families.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall utilize amounts credited to the fund described in subsection (g) of this section for the sole purpose of carrying out the purposes of section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. No payments may be made from such fund unless approved in an appropriation Act. No amount may be so approved for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To ensure that eligible tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this subsection immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into under this subsection with owners of projects assisted but not subject to mortgages insured under this section to provide sufficient payments to cover <!-- PDFPage:641 -->100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of eligible tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under section 1437c(c) of title 42. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In order to induce advances by owners for capital improvements (excluding any owner contributions that may be required by the Secretary as a condition for assistance under section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978) to benefit projects assisted under this section, in establishing basic rental charges and fair market rental charges under paragraph (1) the Secretary may include an amount that would permit a return of such advances with interest to the owner out of project income, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine. Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Assistance under section 1437f of title 42 shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriations Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effects on income-eligible tenants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), tenants whose incomes exceed 80 percent of area median income shall pay as rent the lower of the following amounts: (A) 30 percent of the family's adjusted monthly income; or (B) the relevant fair market rental established under section 1437f(b) of title 42 for the jurisdiction in which the housing is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An owner shall phase in any increase in rents for current tenants resulting from subparagraph (A). Rental charges collected in excess of the basic rental charges shall continue to be credited to the reserve fund described in subsection (g)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_3_target" name="1715z-1_3">3</a></sup> of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Collection and deposit of excess rental charges for reserve fund for additional assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The project owner shall, as required by the Secretary, accumulate, safeguard, and periodically pay to the Secretary all rental charges collected in excess of the basic rental charges. Such excess charges shall be credited to a reserve fund to be used by the Secretary to make additional assistance payments as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to establishing the requirements specified in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make such rules and regulations, to enter into such agreements, and to adopt such procedures as he may deem necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of contracts; contracts for assistance payments; income limitations; availability of amounts for projects approved prior to rehabilitation and projects for occupancy by elderly or handicapped families; definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including such sums as may be necessary to make interest reduction payments under contracts entered into by the Secretary under this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Contracts for assistance payments under this section may be entered into only with respect to tenants whose incomes do not exceed 80 per centum of the median family income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of his findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low family incomes, or other factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not less than 10 per centum of the total amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized by appropriation Acts to be made after June 30, 1974, shall be available for use only with respect to dwellings, or dwelling units in projects, which are approved by the Secretary prior to rehabilitation.</p>
