<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the requirements of this section and on such other terms and conditions as the Corporation shall consider appropriate, the Corporation shall guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the securities issued by a certified facility that represents interests solely in, or obligations fully backed by, any pool consisting solely of qualified loans which meet the standards established under section 2279aa&ndash;8 of this title and which are held by such facility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inability of facility to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the facility is unable to make any payment of principal or interest on any security for which a guarantee has been provided by the Corporation under paragraph (1), subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section the Corporation shall make such payment as and when due in cash, and on such payment shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Power of Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Corporation is empowered, in connection with any guarantee under this subsection, whether before or after any default, to provide <!-- PDFPage:1252 -->by contract with the facility for the extinguishment, on default by the facility, of any redemption, equitable, legal, or other right, title, or interest of the facility in any mortgage or mortgages constituting the pool against which the guaranteed securities are issued. With respect to any issue of guaranteed securities, in the event of default and pursuant otherwise to the terms of the contract, the mortgages that constitute such pool shall become the absolute property of the Corporation subject only to the unsatisfied rights of the holders of the securities based on and backed by such pool.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reserve or subordinated participation requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any pool referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Corporation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide a guarantee only with respect to an individual pool of qualified loans on application of a certified facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide a guarantee only if a reserve, or retained subordinated participating interests, in an amount equal to at least 10 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the loans constituting the pool has been established in accordance with this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require that full recourse be taken against reserves and retained subordinated participating interests before any demand be made by the certified facility with respect to the guarantee of the Corporation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure the timely receipt of principal and interest due to security or obligation holders only after full recourse has been taken against such reserves and retained subordinated participating interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standards requiring diversified pools</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To reduce the risks incurred by the Corporation in providing guarantees under this section and to further the purposes of this subchapter, the Board shall establish standards governing the composition of each pool of qualified loans (in connection with which such guarantees are provided) over the period during which the commitment to provide guarantees is effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) require that each pool consist of not less than 50 loans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Small farms and family farmers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the standards described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii), the Board shall include provisions that promote and encourage the inclusion of loans for small farms and family farmers in pools of qualified loans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Congressional review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No standard prescribed under this subsection shall take effect before the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the end of a period consisting of 30 legislative days and beginning on the date such standards are submitted to Congress; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the end of a period consisting of 90 calendar days and beginning on such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other responsibilities of and limitations on certified facilities</h4>
