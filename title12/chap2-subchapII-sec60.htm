<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Periodic declaration; surplus fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The directors of any national banking association may, quarterly, semiannually or annually, declare a dividend of so much of the undivided profits of the association, subject to the limitations in subsection (b) of this section, as they shall judge expedient, except that until the surplus fund of such association shall equal its common capital, no dividends shall be declared unless there has been carried to the surplus fund not less than one-tenth part of the association's net income of the preceding half year in the case of quarterly or semiannual dividends, or not less than one-tenth part of its net income of the preceding two consecutive half-year periods in the case of annual dividends: <em>Provided</em>, That for the purposes of this section, any amounts paid into a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock of any such association out of its net income for such period or periods shall be deemed to be additions to its surplus fund if, upon the retirement of such preferred stock, the amounts so paid into such retirement fund may then properly be carried to surplus. In any such case the association shall be obligated to transfer to surplus the amounts so paid into such retirement fund on account of the preferred stock as such stock is retired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval of Comptroller</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency shall be required if the total of all dividends declared by such association in any calendar year shall exceed the total of its net income of that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock.</p>
