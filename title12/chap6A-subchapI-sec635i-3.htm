<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) tied aid and partially untied aid credits offered by other countries are a predatory method of financing exports because of their market-distorting effects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) these distortions have caused the United States to lose export sales, with resulting losses in economic growth and employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) these practices undermine market mechanisms that would otherwise result in export purchase decisions made on the basis of price, quality, delivery, and other factors directly related to the export, where official financing is not subsidized and would be a neutral factor in the transaction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) support of commercial exports by donor countries with tied aid and partially untied aid credits impedes the growth of developing countries because it diverts development assistance funds from essential developmental purposes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there should be established in the Bank a tied aid program to target the export markets of those countries which make extensive use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits for commercial advantage for the purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) enforcing compliance with the existing Arrangement restricting the use of tied aid and partially untied aid credits for commercial purposes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) facilitating efforts to negotiate, establish, and enforce new or revised comprehensive international arrangements effectively restricting the use of tied aid and partially untied aid credits for commercial purposes;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and such program should be used aggressively for such purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of tied aid credit program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bank shall establish a tied aid credit program under which grants shall be made from funds available in the Tied Aid Credit Fund established under subsection (c) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to supplement the financing of a United States export when there is a reasonable expectation that predatory financing will be provided by another country for a sale by a competitor of the United States exporter with respect to such export and with special attention to matching tied aid and partially untied aid credits extended by other governments&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in violation of the Arrangement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in cases in which the Bank determines that United States trade or economic interests justify the matching of tied aid credits extended in compliance with the Arrangement, including grandfathered cases;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to supplement the financing of United States exports to foreign markets which are actual or potential export markets for any country which the Bank determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) engages in predatory official export financing through the use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits, and impedes negotiations or violates agreements on tied aid to eliminate the use of such credits for commercial purposes; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) engages in predatory financing practices that seek to circumvent international agreements on tied aid; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to supplement the financing of United States exports under such other circumstances as the Bank may determine to be appropriate for carrying out the purposes of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tied aid credit program shall be administered by the Bank&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in consultation with the Secretary and in accordance with the Secretary's recommendations on how such credits could be used most effectively and efficiently to carry out the purposes described in subsection (a)(5) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in cooperation with United States exporters and private financial institutions or <!-- PDFPage:210 -->entities, and in consultation with other Federal agencies, as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Coordination with other export financing</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any export financing provided by any private financial institution or other entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any other type of export financing,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in such manner and under such terms as the Bank determines to be appropriate, including combinations of export financing in the form of blended financing and parallel financing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Information on countries which engage in official predatory export financing and impede negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to assist the Bank to make the most efficient use of funds available for supplemental financing under paragraph (1)(B), the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce may provide information on principal sectors and key markets of countries described in paragraph (1)(B) to the Bank, the Secretary, and the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies. The Bank shall also request and take into consideration the views of the private sector on principal sectors and key markets of countries described in paragraph (1)(B).</p>
