<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procurement subject to other law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any procurement, by any procuring agency, which is subject to regulations of the Administrator under section 6962 of title 42, shall not be subject to the requirements of this section to the extent that such requirements are inconsistent with such regulations.</p>

Subject to such limitations, agencies may make an award to a vendor offering items with less than the maximum biobased products content.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Minimum content standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Minimum biobased products content specifications which are set in such a way as to assure that the biobased products content required is consistent with the requirements of this section, without violating the limitations of subsection (c)(2) (A) through (C) of this section.</p>
