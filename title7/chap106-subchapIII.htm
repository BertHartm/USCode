<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Average yield and acreage average for historic peanut producers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of average yield</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall determine, for each historic peanut producer, the average yield for peanuts on each farm on which the historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which the producer did not plant or was prevented from planting peanuts.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Assigned yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of determining the 4-year average yield for an historic peanut producer under this paragraph, the historic peanut producer may elect to substitute for a farm, for not more than 3 of the 1998 through 2001 crop years in which the producer planted peanuts on the farm, the average yield for peanuts produced in the county in which the farm is located for the 1990 through 1997 crop years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of acreage average</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Inclusion of all 4 years in average</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of determining the 4-year acreage average for an historic peanut producer under this paragraph, the Secretary shall not exclude any crop year in which the producer did not plant peanuts.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Proportional shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If more than 1 historic peanut producer shared in the risk of producing the crop on a farm, the historic peanut producers shall receive their proportional share of the number of acres planted (or prevented from being planted) to peanuts for harvest on the farm based on the sharing arrangement that was in effect among the producers for the crop.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time for determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make the determinations required by this subsection as soon as practicable after May 13, 2002.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on acreage assignment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the average acreage determined under subsection (a)(2) of this section for a farm may not be assigned to a farm in a contiguous State unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the historic peanut producer making the assignment produced peanuts in that State during at least 1 of the 1998 through 2001 crop years; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of March 31, 2003, the historic peanut producer is a producer on a farm in that State.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Eligible peanut quota holder</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary shall consider a person to be an eligible peanut quota holder for the purposes of this section if the person, as of May 13, 2002, owned a farm that, also as of that date, was eligible for a permanent peanut quota under section 358&ndash;1(b) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1358&ndash;1(b)), irrespective of temporary leases, transfers of quotas for seed, or quotas for experimental purposes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of purchase contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there was a written contract for the purchase of all or a portion of a farm described in paragraph (1) as of May 13, 2002, and the parties to the sale are unable to agree to the disposition of eligibility for payments under this section, the Secretary, taking into account any incomplete permanent transfer of quota that has otherwise been agreed to, shall provide for the equitable division of the payments <!-- PDFPage:1890 -->among the parties by adjusting the determination of who is the eligible peanut quota holder with respect to particular pounds of the quota.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of agreement for permanent quota transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that there was in existence, as of May 13, 2002, an agreement for the permanent transfer of quota, but that the transfer was not completed by that date, the Secretary shall consider the peanut quota holder to be the party to the agreement who, as of that date, was the owner of the farm to which the quota was to be transferred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Protected bases</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Secretarial discretion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, the Secretary may declare a person to be the eligible peanut quota holder with respect to certain pounds of quota or otherwise for purposes of this section if the Secretary considers the declaration is needed to insure a fair and equitable administration of the payments provided for in this section, so long as the Secretary does not, in exercising this authority, effectively increase the total quota in excess of the quota that was available to all producers for the 2001 crop year for other than seed or experimental use.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Limitation on quantity of quota held</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person shall be considered an eligible peanut quota holder for purposes of this section only with respect to that number of permanent pounds that qualifies the person as a peanut quota holder under one of the preceding paragraphs. The determination of the peanut poundage amount for which the person qualifies shall be made based on the 2001 crop quota levels and shall take into account sales of the farm that occurred before May 13, 2002, and any permanent transfers of quota that took place before that date, consistent with the preceding paragraphs. The Secretary shall not take into account, or allow eligibility for, quotas for seed, granted as experimental quotas, or obtained by temporary lease or transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Successions in payment eligibility and attachment of eligibility to persons</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligibility attaches to persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Once a person is eligible for payments under this section, as determined under subsection (f) of this section, the continued eligibility of the person for the payments does not run with a farm, but shall remain with the person for the term of this section irrespective of whether the person sells, or continues to have an interest in, the farm that had the quota that qualified the person as an eligible peanut quota holder under subsection (f) of this section and irrespective of whether the person has a continuing interest in the production of peanuts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Succession</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a person eligible for payments under this section dies, in the case of an individual, or ceases to exist, in the case of other persons, the payment eligibility of the person shall pass to the person's personal or organizational successor, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
