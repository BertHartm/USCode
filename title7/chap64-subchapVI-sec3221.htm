Beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, there shall be appropriated under this section an amount not less than 51/2 per centum, and for each fiscal year thereafter an amount not less than 6 per centum of the total appropriations for such year under the Act of May 8, 1914 (7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.), and related acts pertaining to cooperative extension work at the land-grant institutions identified in the Act of May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 372, chapter 79; 7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.), except that for the purpose of this calculation, the total appropriations shall not include amounts made available after September 30, 1995, under section 3(d) of that Act (7 U.S.C. 343(d)), to carry out programs or initiatives for which no funds were made available under section 3(d) of that Act for fiscal year 1995, or any previous fiscal year, as determined by the Secretary, and shall not include amounts made available after September 30, 1995, to carry out programs or initiatives funded under section 3(d) of that Act prior to that date that are in excess of the highest amount made available for the programs or initiatives for fiscal year 1995, or any previous fiscal year, as determined by the Secretary. Funds appropriated under this section shall be used for expenses of conducting extension programs and <!-- PDFPage:1224 -->activities, and for contributing to the retirement of employees subject to the provisions of section 331 of this title.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation and distribution of appropriated funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1979&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any funds annually appropriated under this section up to the amount appropriated for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, pursuant to section 343(d) of this title, for eligible institutions, shall be allocated among the eligible institutions in the same proportion as funds appropriated under section 343(d) of this title for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, are allocated among the eligible institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any funds appropriated annually under this section in excess of an amount equal to the amount appropriated under section 343(d) of this title, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, for eligible institutions, shall be distributed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A sum equal to 4 per centum of the total amount appropriated each fiscal year under this section shall be allotted to the Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture for administrative, technical, and other services, and for coordinating the extension work of the Department of Agriculture and the several States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Of the remainder, 20 per centum shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in equal proportions; 40 per centum shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in the proportion that the rural population of the State in which each eligible institution is located bears to the total rural population of all the States in which eligible institutions are located, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at the time each such additional sum is first appropriated; and the balance shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in the proportion that the farm population of the State in which each eligible institution is located bears to the total farm population of all the States in which the eligible institutions are located, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at the time each such additional sum is first appropriated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In computing the distribution of funds allocated under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the allotments to Tuskegee Institute and Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University shall be determined as if each institution were in a separate State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Comprehensive program of extension for each State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State director of the cooperative extension service and the extension administrator at the eligible institution in each State where an eligible institution is located shall jointly develop, by mutual agreement, a comprehensive program of extension for such State to be submitted for approval by the Secretary within one year after September 29, 1977 and each five years thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of funds to eligible institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On or about the first day of October in each year after September 29, 1977, the Secretary shall ascertain whether each eligible institution is entitled to receive its share of the annual appropriation for extension work under this section and the amount which it is entitled to receive. Before the funds herein provided shall become available to any eligible institution for any fiscal year, plans for the work to be carried out under this section shall be submitted, as part of the State plan of work, and approved by the Secretary. Such sums shall be paid in equal quarterly payments on or about October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1 of each year to the treasurer or other officer of the eligible institution duly authorized to receive such payments and such officer shall be required to report to the Secretary on or about the first day of December of each year a detailed statement of the amount so received during the previous fiscal year and its disbursement, on forms prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Diminution, loss, or misapplication of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any portion of the moneys received by any eligible institution for the support and maintenance of extension work as provided in this section shall by any action or contingency be diminished or lost or be misapplied, it shall be replaced by such institution and until so replaced no subsequent appropriation shall be apportioned or paid to such institution. No portion of such moneys shall be applied, directly or indirectly, to the purchase, erection, preservation, or repair of any building or buildings, or the purchase or rental of land, or in college course teaching, lectures in college, or any other purpose not specified in this section. It shall be the duty of such institution, annually, on or about the first day of January, to make to the Governor of the State in which it is located a full and detailed report of its operations in extension work, including a detailed statement of receipts and expenditures from all sources for this purpose, a copy of which report shall be sent to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Secretary's finding of non-entitlement to appropriated funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary finds that an eligible institution is not entitled to receive its share of the annual appropriation, the facts and reasons therefor shall be reported to the President, and the amount involved shall be kept separate in the Treasury until the expiration of the next Congress in order that the institution may, if it should so desire, appeal to Congress from the determination of the Secretary. If the next Congress does not direct such sum to be paid, it shall be carried to surplus.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mailing of correspondence, bulletins, and reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent that the official mail consists of correspondence, bulletins, and reports for furtherance of the purposes of this section, it shall be transmitted in the mails of the United States <!-- PDFPage:1225 -->under penalty indicia: <em>Provided</em>, That each item shall bear such indicia as are prescribed by the Postmaster General and shall be mailed under such regulations as the Postmaster General may from time to time prescribe. Such items may be mailed from a principal place of business of each eligible institution or from an established subunit of such institution.</p>
