<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) total supplies of such commodity in the exporting countries are estimated to be in surplus,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President shall not prohibit or curtail the export of any agricultural commodity under an export sales contract&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the terms of which require delivery of the commodity within 270 days after the date of the suspension of trade is imposed,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the President may prohibit or curtail the export of any agricultural commodity during a period for which the President has declared a national emergency or for which the Congress has declared war.</p>
