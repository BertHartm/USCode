In effecting any such termination, the Secretary shall afford the borrower-owner or lessee the notice and hearing procedural rights described in section 1983b&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2000_2_target" name="2000_2">2</a></sup> of this title and shall comply with all applicable State and local laws governing eviction from residential property.</p>

Such terms and conditions shall not be less favorable than those intended to be offered to any other buyer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Value as measure of reacquisition payment of principal</h4>
