<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allocation to processors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever marketing allotments are established for a crop year under section 1359cc of this title, in order to afford all interested persons an equitable opportunity to market sugar under an allotment, the Secretary shall allocate each such allotment among the processors covered by the allotment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hearing and notice</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cane sugar</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall make allocations for cane sugar after a hearing, if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers, and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in such manner and in such quantities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of the allocations under this paragraph. Each such allocation shall be subject to adjustment under section 1359cc(g) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Multiple processor States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D), the Secretary shall allocate the allotment for cane sugar among multiple cane sugar processors in a single State based on&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ability of processors to market sugar covered by that portion of the allotment allocated for the crop year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) past processings of sugar from sugarcane, based on the average of the 3 highest years of production during the 1996 through 2000 crop years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Talisman processing facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of allotments under subparagraph (B) attributable to the operations of the Talisman processing facility before May 13, 2002, the Secretary shall allocate the allotment among processors in the State under subparagraph (A) in accordance with the agreements of March 25 and 26, 1999, between the affected processors and the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Proportionate share States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of States subject to section 1359ff(c) of this title, the Secretary shall allocate the allotment for cane sugar among multiple cane sugar processors in a single State based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) past marketings of sugar, based on the average of the 2 highest years of production of raw cane sugar from among the 1997 through 2001 crop years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ability of processors to market sugar covered by that portion of the allotments allocated for the crop year; and</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 1359cc(e)(3) of this title, to accommodate an allocation under clause (i) to a new processor located in a new entrant mainland State, the Secretary shall provide the new entrant mainland State with an allotment.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Effect on other allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The allotment to any new entrant mainland State shall be subtracted, on a pro rata basis, from the allotments otherwise allotted to each mainland State under section 1359cc(e)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Adverse effects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Before providing an initial processor allocation or State allotment to a new entrant processor or a new entrant State under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall take into consideration any adverse effects that the provision of the allocation or allotment may have on existing cane processors and producers in mainland States.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Ability to market</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Consistent with section 1359cc of this title and this section, any processor allocation or State allotment made to a new entrant processor or to a new entrant State under this subparagraph shall be provided only after the applicant processor, or the applicable processors in the State, have demonstrated the ability to process, produce, and market (including the transfer or delivery of the raw cane sugar to a refinery for further processing or marketing) raw cane sugar for the crop year for which the allotment is applicable.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Prohibition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in the case of a processor that closed a sugar beet processing factory, decreased by 1.25 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years (without consideration of any adjustment under this subparagraph) for each sugar beet processing factory that is closed by the processor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) in the case of a processor that constructed a molasses desugarization facility, increased by 0.25 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years (without consideration of any adjustment under this subparagraph) for each molasses desugarization facility that is constructed by the processor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) in the case of a processor that suffered substantial quality losses on stored sugar beets, increased by 1.25 percent of the total of the adjusted weighted average quantities of beet sugar produced by all processors during the 1998 through 2000 crop years (without consideration of any adjustment under this subparagraph).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Permanent termination of operations of a processor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a processor of beet sugar has been dissolved, liquidated in a bankruptcy proceeding, or otherwise has permanently terminated operations (other than in conjunction with a sale or other disposition of the processor or the assets of the processor), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) eliminate the allocation of the processor provided under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) distribute the allocation to other beet sugar processors on a pro rata basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Sale of all assets of a processor to another processor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a processor of beet sugar (or all of the assets of the processor) is sold to another processor of beet sugar, the Secretary shall transfer the allocation of the seller to the buyer unless the allocation has been distributed to other sugar beet processors under subparagraph (E).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Sale of factories of a processor to another processor</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Effect of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to subparagraphs (E) and (F), if 1 or more factories of a processor of beet sugar (but not all of the assets of the processor) are sold to another processor of beet sugar during a crop year, the Secretary shall assign a pro rata portion of the allocation of the seller to the allocation of the buyer to reflect the historical contribution of the production of the sold 1 or more factories to the total allocation of the seller, unless the buyer and the seller have agreed upon the transfer of a different portion of the allocation of the seller, in which case, the Secretary shall transfer that portion agreed upon by the buyer and seller.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Application of allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The assignment of the allocation under clause (i) shall apply&mdash;</p>
