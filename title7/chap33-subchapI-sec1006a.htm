The first installment for the repayment of any such loan or any other loan made under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended, or the Act of August 28, 1937, as amended, to the owner of a newly irrigated farm in a reclamation project or to an entryman under the desertland laws, may be deferred for a period of not to exceed two years from the date of the first advance under such loan.</p>
