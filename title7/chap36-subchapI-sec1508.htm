Any fees in connection with such policies that are not yet collected at the time of the transfer shall be payable to the approved insurance providers assuming the policies. The transfer process for policies for the 1997 crop year with sales closing dates before January 1, 1997, shall begin at the time of the Secretary's announcement under clause (iii) and be completed by the sales closing date for the crop and county.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfer of relevant information</h4>
