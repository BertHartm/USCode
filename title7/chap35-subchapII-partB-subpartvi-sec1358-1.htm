<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National poundage quotas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The national poundage quota for peanuts for each marketing year shall be established by the Secretary at a level that is equal to the quantity of peanuts (in tons) that the Secretary estimates will be devoted in each such marketing year to domestic edible use (except seed) and related uses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Announcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The national poundage quota for a marketing year shall be announced by the Secretary not later than December 15 preceding the marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Apportionment among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The national poundage quota established under paragraph (1) shall be apportioned among the States so that the poundage quota allocated to each State shall be equal to the percentage of the national poundage quota allocated to farms in the State for 1990, for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years, and 1995, for the 1996 through 2002 marketing years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Farm poundage quotas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A farm poundage quota for each marketing year shall be established&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for each farm that had a farm poundage quota for peanuts for the 1990 marketing year, in the case of the 1991 through 1995 marketing years, and the 1995 marketing year, in the case of the 1996 through 2002 marketing years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the poundage quota apportioned to a State under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any such marketing year is larger than the quota for the immediately preceding marketing year, for each other farm on which peanuts were produced for marketing in at least 2 of the 3 immediately preceding crop years, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) as approved and determined by the Secretary under section 1358c of this title, for each farm on which peanuts are produced in connection with experimental and research programs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The farm poundage quota for each marketing year for each farm described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be the same as the farm poundage quota for the farm for the immediately preceding marketing year, as adjusted under paragraph (2), but not including any increases resulting from the allocation of quotas voluntarily released for 1 year under paragraph (7). The farm poundage quota, if any, for each marketing year for each farm described in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be equal to the quantity of peanuts allocated to the farm for the year under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, if the farm poundage quota, or any part thereof, is permanently transferred in accordance with section 1358a or 1358b of this title, the receiving farm shall be considered as possessing the farm poundage quota (or portion thereof) of the transferring farm for all subsequent marketing years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Certain farms ineligible for quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Effective beginning with the 1998 crop, the Secretary shall not establish a farm poundage quota under subparagraph (A) for a farm owned or controlled by&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:570 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a municipality, airport authority, school, college, refuge, or other public entity (other than a university used for research purposes); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a person who is not a producer and resides in another State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Allocation of increased quota generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (D), if the poundage quota apportioned to a State under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any marketing year is increased over the poundage quota apportioned to farms in the State for the immediately preceding marketing year, the increase shall be allocated proportionately, based on farm production history for peanuts for the 3 immediately preceding years, among&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) all farms in the State for each of which a farm poundage quota was established for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the allocation is being made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) all other farms in the State on each of which peanuts were produced in at least 2 of the 3 immediately preceding crop years, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Temporary quota allocation</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Allocation related to seed peanuts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Temporary allocation of quota pounds for the marketing year only in which the crop is planted shall be made to producers for each of the 1996 through 2002 marketing years as provided in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The temporary quota allocation shall be equal to the pounds of seed peanuts planted on the farm, as may be adjusted and determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Additional quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The temporary allocation of quota pounds under this paragraph shall be in addition to the farm poundage quota otherwise established under this subsection and shall be credited, for the applicable marketing year only, in total, to the producer of the peanuts on the farm in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Effect of other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Nothing in this section alters or changes the requirements regarding the use of quota and additional peanuts established by section 1359a(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Decrease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the poundage quota apportioned to a State under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any marketing year is decreased from the poundage quota apportioned to farms in the State under subsection (a)(3) of this section for the immediately preceding marketing year, the decrease shall be allocated among all the farms in the State for each of which a farm poundage quota was established for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the allocation is being made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rule on tenant's share of increased quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, on farms that were leased to a tenant for peanut production, the tenant shall share equally with the owner of the farm in that percentage of the quota referred to in subparagraph (A) and otherwise allocated to the farm as the result of the tenant's production on the farm of additional peanuts. Not later than April 1 of each year or as soon as practicable, the tenant's share of any such quota shall be allocated to a farm within the county owned by the tenant or sold by the tenant to the owner of any farm within the county and permanently transferred to that farm. Any quota not so disposed of as provided in this subparagraph shall be allocated to other quota farms in the State under paragraph (6) as part of the quota reduced from farms in the State due to the failure to produce the quota.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Transfer of quota from ineligible farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any farm poundage quota held at the end of the 1996 marketing year by a farm described in paragraph (1)(D) shall be allocated to other farms in the same State on such basis as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Quota not produced</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Insofar as practicable and on such fair and equitable basis as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, the farm poundage quota established for a farm for any marketing year shall be reduced to the extent that the Secretary determines that the farm poundage quota established for the farm for any 2 of the 3 marketing years preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made was not produced, or considered produced, on the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of this paragraph, the farm poundage quota for any such preceding marketing year shall not include any increase resulting from the allocation of quotas voluntarily released for 1 year under paragraph (7).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Quota considered produced</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the farm poundage quota shall be considered produced on a farm if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the farm poundage quota was not produced on the farm because of drought, flood, or any other natural disaster, or any other condition beyond the control of the producer, as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the farm poundage quota for the farm was released voluntarily under paragraph (7) for only 1 of the 3 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the farm poundage quota was leased to another owner or operator of a farm within the same county for transfer to such farm for only 1 of the 3 marketing years imme<!-- PDFPage:571 -->diately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Quota permanently released</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the farm poundage quota established for a farm under this subsection, or any part of the quota, may be permanently released by the owner of the farm, or the operator with the permission of the owner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the poundage quota for the farm for which the quota is released shall be adjusted downward to reflect the quota that is so released.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Allocation of quotas reduced or released</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the total quantity of the farm poundage quotas reduced or voluntarily released from farms in a State for any marketing year under paragraphs (3) and (5) shall be allocated, as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, to other farms in the State on which peanuts were produced in at least 2 of the 3 crop years immediately preceding the year for which the allocation is being made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Set-aside for farms with no quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not more than 25 percent of the total amount of farm poundage quota to be allocated in the State under subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to farms in the State for which no farm poundage quota was established for the immediately preceding year's crop. The allocation to any such farm shall not exceed the average farm production of peanuts for the 3 immediately preceding years during which peanuts were produced on the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Allocation of quotas reduced or released in Texas</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In Texas, and subject to terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, beginning with the 1991 marketing year, the total quantity of the farm poundage quota, except the percentage allocated to new farms under subparagraph (B), shall be allocated to other farms having poundage quotas for the 1990 marketing year in all counties in which the production of additional peanuts exceeded the total quota allocated to the county for the 1989 marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Basis for allocation to counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The allocation of the quota to eligible counties shall be based on the total production of additional peanuts in the respective county for the 1988 crop, except that the total quota allocated to any county under this subparagraph and paragraph (2)(B) shall not be increased by more than 100 percent of the basic quota allocated to the county for the 1989 marketing year, if that county had more than 10,000 tons of quota for the 1989 marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Allocation to other counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the total quota for any such county is so increased by 100 percent, all of the remaining quota set aside under this subparagraph shall be allocated to farms in other counties otherwise meeting the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Allocation to eligible farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The percentage of farm poundage quota available for allocation under this subparagraph shall be allocated only to quota farms from which additional peanuts were delivered under contract with handlers for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the allocation is being made. The percentage of the increased quota in each county shall be allocated among the eligible farms in the county on the following basis:</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) Factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">A factor shall be established for each such eligible farm by dividing the amount of additional peanuts contracted and delivered to handlers from the farm by the total remaining peanuts produced on the farm for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the allocation is being made.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Each such eligible farm shall be allocated the percentage of the increased quota for the county as its factor bears to the total of the factors for all eligible farms in the county.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Quota temporarily released</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The farm poundage quota, or any portion thereof, established for a farm for a marketing year may be voluntarily released to the Secretary to the extent that the quota, or any part thereof, will not be produced on the farm for the marketing year. Any farm poundage quota so released in a State shall be allocated to other farms in the State on such basis as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effective period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, any adjustment in the farm poundage quota for a farm under subparagraph (A) shall be effective only for the marketing year for which it is made and shall not be taken into consideration in establishing a farm poundage quota for the farm from which the quota was released for any subsequent marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Disaster transfers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), additional peanuts produced on a farm from which the quota poundage was not harvested and marketed because of drought, flood, or any other natural disaster, or any other condition beyond the control of the producer, may be transferred to the quota loan pool for pricing purposes on such basis as the Secretary shall by regulation provide.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The poundage of peanuts transferred under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed the difference between&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:572 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total quantity of peanuts meeting quality requirements for domestic edible use, as determined by the Secretary, marketed from the farm; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total farm poundage quota, excluding quota pounds transferred to the farm in the fall.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Support rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Peanuts transferred under this paragraph shall be supported at 70 percent of the quota support rate for the marketing years in which the transfers occur. The transfers for a farm shall not exceed 25 percent of the total farm quota pounds, excluding pounds transferred in the fall.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Farm yields</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each farm for which a farm poundage quota is established under subsection (b) of this section, and when necessary for purposes of this chapter, a farm yield of peanuts shall be determined for each such farm.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The yield shall be equal to the average of the actual yield per acre on the farm for each of the 3 crop years in which yields were highest on the farm out of the 5 crop years 1973 through 1977.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appraised yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If peanuts were not produced on the farm in at least 3 years during the 5-year period or there was a substantial change in the operation of the farm during the period (including a change in operator, lessee who is an operator, or irrigation practices), the Secretary shall have a yield appraised for the farm. The appraised yield shall be that quantity determined to be fair and reasonable on the basis of yields established for similar farms that are located in the area of the farm and on which peanuts were produced, taking into consideration land, labor, and equipment available for the production of peanuts, crop rotation practices, soil and water, and other relevant factors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Referendum respecting poundage quotas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than December 15 of each calendar year, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of producers engaged in the production of quota peanuts in the calendar year in which the referendum is held to determine whether the producers are in favor of or opposed to poundage quotas with respect to the crops of peanuts produced in the 5 calendar years immediately following the year in which the referendum is held, except that, if as many as two-thirds of the producers voting in any referendum vote in favor of poundage quotas, no referendum shall be held with respect to quotas for the second, third, fourth, and fifth years of the period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Proclamation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall proclaim the result of the referendum within 30 days after the date on which it is held.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Vote against quotas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If more than one-third of the producers voting in the referendum vote against quotas, the Secretary also shall proclaim that poundage quotas will not be in effect with respect to the crop of peanuts produced in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the referendum is held.</p>
