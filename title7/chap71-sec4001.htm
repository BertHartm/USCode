<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President or other member of the executive branch of Government causes the export of any agricultural commodity to any country or area of the world to be suspended or restricted for reasons of national security or foreign policy under the Export Administration Act of 1979 [50 App. U.S.C. 2401 et seq.] or any other provision of law and the Secretary of Agriculture determines that such suspension or restriction will result in a surplus supply of such commodity that will adversely affect prices producers receive for the commodity, the Secretary may establish a gasohol feedstock reserve or a food security reserve, or both, of the commodity, as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if the commodity is suitable for stockpiling in a reserve.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Announcement of intention to establish reserves; contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within thirty days after the export of any agricultural commodity to a country or area is suspended or restricted as described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Agriculture shall announce whether a gasohol feedstock reserve or a food security reserve of the commodity, or both, will be established under this section and shall include in such announcement the amount of the commodity that will be placed in such reserves, which shall be that portion of the estimated exports of the commodity affected by the suspension or restriction, as determined by the Secretary, that should be removed from the market to prevent the accumulation of a surplus supply of the commodity that will adversely affect prices producers receive for the commodity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acquisition of suitable agricultural commodities; payment of transportation and storage costs; disposition of acquired commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To establish a gasohol feedstock reserve under this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may acquire agricultural commodities (the export of which is suspended or restricted as described in subsection (a) of this section) that are suitable for use in the production of alcohol for motor fuel through purchases from producers or in the market and by designation by the Secretary of stocks of the commodities held by the Commodity Credit Corporation, and to pay such storage, transportation, and related costs as may be necessary to permit maintenance of the commodities in the reserve for the purposes of this section and disposition of the commodities as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for any other use, when sales for use under clause (A) of this paragraph are impracticable, (i) if there is a producer storage program in effect for the commodity, at not less than 110 per centum of the then current level at which the Secretary may encourage repayment of producer storage loans on the commodity prior to the maturity dates of the loans, as determined under clause (5) of the third sentence of section 1445e(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#4001_1_target" name="4001_1">1</a></sup> of this title, or, (ii) if there is no producer storage program in effect for the commodity, at not less than the average market price producers received for the commodity at the time the trade suspension was imposed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) To establish a food security reserve under this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may acquire agricultural commodities (the export of which is suspended or restricted as described in subsection (a) of this section) that are suitable for use in providing emergency food assistance and urgent humanitarian relief through purchases from producers or in the market and by designation by the Secretary of stocks of the commodities held by the Commodity Credit Corporation, and to pay such storage, transportation, and related costs as may be necessary to permit maintenance of the commodities in the reserve for the purposes of this section and disposition of the commodities as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of certain provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f)(2) of section 1736f&ndash;1 of this title shall apply to commodities in any reserve established under paragraph (1), except that the references to &ldquo;eligible commodities&rdquo; in the subsections shall be deemed to be references to &ldquo;agricultural commodities&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any determination by the President or the Secretary of Agriculture under this section shall be final.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of Commodity Credit Corporation funds, facilities, and authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be used by the Secretary of Agriculture in carrying out this section, except that any restriction applicable to the acquisition, storage, or disposition of Commodity Credit Corporation owned or controlled commodities shall not apply with respect to the acquisition, storage, or disposition of agricultural commodities under this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1346 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Safeguards for protection of free market</h4>
