<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Project may be implemented only in accordance with this section and only if the Secretary of Health and Human Services approves an application submitted by the State permitting the State to include in the Project families who are eligible to receive benefits under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required terms and conditions of Project</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Only families may be eligible to receive assistance and services through the Project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Participating families, families eligible for or participating in the program authorized under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] or the food stamp program that are assigned to and found eligible for the Project, and families required to submit an application for the Project that are found eligible for the Project shall be ineligible to receive benefits under the food stamp program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph and any reduction imposed under subsection (c)(3) of this section, the value of assistance provided to participating families shall not be less than the aggregate value of the assistance such families could receive under the food stamp program and part A of title IV of the Social Security Act if such families did not participate in the Project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) increase the amount of assistance provided under the Project to any family that could receive more assistance, in the aggregate, under the food stamp program and part A of title IV of the Social Security Act if such family did not participate in the Project, so that the assistance provided under the Project to such family is not less than the aggregate amount of assistance such family could receive under the food stamp program and part A of title IV of the Social Security Act if such family did not participate in the Project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) increase the amount of assistance paid to participating families, if the State or locality imposes a sales tax on food, by the amount needed to compensate for the tax.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Such individuals&rsquo; monthly allotment shall be the higher of $10 or 75 percent of the amount calculated following the standards of the food stamp program and the foregoing requirements of this subparagraph, rounded to the nearest lower whole dollar.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of families determined ineligible for the Project upon application, the application for the Project shall be deemed an application for the food stamp program, and benefits under the food stamp program shall be issued to those found eligible following the standards established under the food stamp program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) expedited benefits shall be provided under terms no more restrictive than under paragraph (9) of section 2020(e) of this title and the laws of Minnesota and shall include expedited issuance of designated food assistance provided through the Project or expedited benefits through the food stamp program;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a family may be represented by another person if the other person has clearly been designated as the representative of such family for that purpose and the representative is an adult who is sufficiently aware of relevant circumstances, except that the State may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) restrict the number of families who may be represented by such person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) otherwise establish criteria and verification standards for representation under this subparagraph; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Whenever selection for participation in the Project is accomplished by assigning families that are determined eligible for or participating in the program authorized by part A of title IV of the Social Security Act or the food stamp program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the State shall provide eligible families assistance under the Project no later than benefits would have been provided following the standards established under the food stamp program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State shall ensure that assistance under the Project is provided so that there is no interruption in benefits for families participating in the program under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act or the food stamp program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Paragraphs (1)(B) and (8) of section 2020(e) of this title shall apply with respect to applicants and participating families in the same manner as such paragraphs apply with respect to applicants and participants in the food stamp program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Assistance provided under the Project shall be reduced to reflect the pro rata value of any coupons received under the food stamp program for the same period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10)(A) The State shall provide each family or family member whose participation in the Project ends and each family whose participation is terminated with notice of the existence of the food stamp program and the person or agency to contact for more information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Following the standards specified in subparagraph (C), the State shall ensure that benefits under the food stamp program are <!-- PDFPage:1104 -->provided to participating families in case the Project is terminated or to participating families or family members that are determined ineligible for the Project because of income, resources, or change in household composition, if such families or individuals are determined eligible for the food stamp program. Food coupons shall be issued to eligible families and individuals described in this clause retroactive to the date of termination from the Project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If sections 256.031 through 256.036 of the Minnesota Statutes, 1989 Supplement, or Minnesota Laws 1989, chapter 282, article 5, section 130, are amended to reduce or eliminate benefits provided under those sections or restrict the rights of Project applicants or participating families, the State shall exclude from the Project applicants or participating families or individuals affected by such amendments and follow the standards specified in subparagraph (C), except that the State shall continue to pay from State funds an amount equal to the food assistance portion to such families and individuals until the State determines eligibility or ineligibility for the food stamp program or the family or individual has failed to supply the needed additional information within ten days. Food coupons shall be provided to families and individuals excluded from the Project under this clause who are determined eligible for the food stamp program retroactive to the date of the determination of eligibility. The Secretary shall pay to the State the value of the food coupons for which such families and individuals would have been eligible in the absence of food assistance payments under this clause from the date of termination from the Project to the date food coupons are provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Each family whose Project participation is terminated shall be screened for potential eligibility for the food stamp program and if the screening indicates potential eligibility, the family or family member shall be given a specific request to supply all additional information needed to determine such eligibility and assistance in completing a signed food stamp program application including provision of any relevant information obtained by the State for purpose of the Project. If the family or family member supplies such additional information within ten days after receiving the request, the State shall, within five days after the State receives such information, determine whether the family or family member is eligible for the food stamp program. Each family or family member who is determined through the screening or otherwise to be ineligible for the food stamp program shall be notified of that determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Section 2020(e)(10) of this title shall apply with respect to applicant and participating families in the same manner as such paragraph applies with respect to applicants and participants in the food stamp program, except that families shall be given notice of any action for which a hearing is available in a manner consistent with the notice requirements of the regulations implementing sections 402(a)(4) and 482(h)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2031_1_target" name="2031_1">1</a></sup> of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 602(a)(4)].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall not be liable for any costs related to carrying out the Project in excess of those that the Secretary would have been liable for had the Project not been implemented, except for costs for evaluating the Project, but shall adjust for the full amount of the federal share of increases or decreases in costs that result from changes in economic, demographic, and other conditions in the State based on data specific to the State, changes in eligibility or benefit levels authorized by this chapter, or changes in amounts of Federal funds available to States and localities under the food stamp program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) The State shall carry out the food stamp program throughout the State while the State carries out the Project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the State will carry out the Project during a five-year period beginning on the date the first family receives assistance under the Project.</p>
