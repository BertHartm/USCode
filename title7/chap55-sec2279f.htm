<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall have power to subpoena the attendance and testimony of any witness, and the production of all documentary evidence relating to the enforcement of section 2279e of this title or any matter under investigation in connection with this section and section 2279e of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Location of production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The attendance of any witness and the production of documentary evidence may be required from any place in the United States at any designated place of hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement of subpoena</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of disobedience to a subpoena by any person, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction in which the investigation is conducted, or where the person resides, is found, transacts business, is licensed to do business, or is incorporated, in requiring the attendance and testimony of any witness and the production of documentary evidence. In case of a refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, a court may order the person to appear before the Secretary and give evidence concerning the matter in question or to produce documentary evidence. Any failure to obey the court's order may be punished by the court as a contempt of the court.</p>
