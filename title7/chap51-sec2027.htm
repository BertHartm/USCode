<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization of allotments; monthly reports of expenditures to Congressional committees; restriction on use of funds; nutrition education improvements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To carry out this chapter, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary for each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2002. Not to exceed one-fourth of 1 per centum of the previous year's appropriation is authorized in each such fiscal year to carry out the provisions of section 2026 of this title, subject to paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No funds authorized to be appropriated under this chapter or any other Act of Congress shall be used by any person, firm, corporation, group, or organization at any time, directly or indirectly, to interfere with or impede the implementation of any provision of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or project thereunder, except that this limitation shall not apply to the provision of legal and related assistance in connection with any proceeding or action before any State or Federal agency or court. The President shall ensure that this paragraph is complied with by such order or other means as the President deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Of the amounts made available under the second sentence of paragraph (1), not more than $2,000,000 in any fiscal year may be used by the Secretary to make 2-year competitive grants that will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) enhance interagency cooperation in nutrition education activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) develop cost effective ways to inform people eligible for food stamps about nutrition, resource management, and community nutrition education programs, such as the expanded food and nutrition education program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make awards under this paragraph to one or more State cooperative extension services (as defined in section 3103(5) of this title) who shall administer the grants in coordination with other State or local agencies serving low-income people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Each project shall include an evaluation component and shall develop an implementation plan for replication in other States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall report to the appropriate committees of Congress on the results of the projects and shall disseminate the results through the cooperative extension service system and to State human services and health department offices, local food stamp program offices, and other entities serving low-income households.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation of value of allotments; reduction of allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any fiscal year, the Secretary shall limit the value of those allotments issued to an amount not in excess of the appropriation for such fiscal year. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if in any fiscal year the Secretary finds that the requirements of participating States will exceed the appropriation, the Secretary shall direct State agencies to reduce the value of such allotments to be issued to households certified as eligible to participate in the food stamp program to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Manner of reducing allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In prescribing the manner in which allotments will be reduced under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall ensure that such reductions reflect, to the maximum extent practicable, the ratio of household income, deter<!-- PDFPage:1083 -->mined under sections 2014(d) and 2014(e) of this title, to the income standards of eligibility, for households of equal size, determined under section 2014(c) of this title. The Secretary may, in prescribing the manner in which allotments will be reduced, establish (1) special provisions applicable to persons sixty years of age or over and persons who are physically or mentally handicapped or otherwise disabled, and (2) minimum allotments after any reductions are otherwise determined under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requisite action by Secretary to reduce allotments; statement to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than sixty days after the issuance of a report under subsection (a) of this section in which the Secretary expresses the belief that reductions in the value of allotments to be issued to households certified to participate in the food stamp program will be necessary, the Secretary shall take the requisite action to reduce allotments in accordance with the requirements of this section. Not later than seven days after the Secretary takes any action to reduce allotments under this section, the Secretary shall furnish the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a statement setting forth (1) the basis of the Secretary's determination, (2) the manner in which the allotments will be reduced, and (3) the action that has been taken by the Secretary to reduce the allotments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disposition of funds collected pursuant to claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds collected from claims against households or State agencies, including claims collected pursuant to sections 2016(f), 2020(g) and (h), and subsections (b) and (c) of section 2022 of this title, claims resulting from resolution of audit findings, and claims collected from households receiving overissuances, shall be credited to the food stamp program appropriation account for the fiscal year in which the collection occurs. Funds provided to State agencies under section 2025(c) of this title shall be paid from the appropriation account for the fiscal year in which the funds are provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds appropriated to carry out this chapter may be transferred to the Office of the Inspector General, or the Office of the General Counsel, of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
