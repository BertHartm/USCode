<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Intent of study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The intent of the study required by this subsection is to examine the cost efficiencies of conducting inspections of aircraft and pilots by one Federal agency without reducing aircraft, passenger, or pilot safety standards or lowering mission preparedness.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Study required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Transportation shall jointly conduct a study of the inspection specifications and procedures by which aircraft and pilots contracted by the Department are certified to determine the cost efficiencies of eliminating duplicative Department inspection requirements and transferring some or all inspection requirements to the Federal Aviation Administration, while ensuring that neither aircraft, passenger, nor pilot safety is reduced and that mission preparedness is maintained.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Special considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In conducting the study, the Secretaries shall evaluate current inspection specifications and procedures mandated by the Department and the Forest Service, taking into consideration the unique requirements and risks of particular Department and Forest Service missions that may require special inspection specifications and procedures to ensure the safety of Department and Forest Service personnel and their contractees.</p>

The policy is currently being cooperatively developed by the Department and the Federal Aviation Administration and is intended to reduce duplicative inspections and to reduce Government costs, while maintaining aircraft, passenger, and pilot safety standards, specifications and procedures currently required by the Department and the Forest Service.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Expansion of policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As part of the review, the Secretaries shall examine the feasibility and desirability of applying this policy on a Government-wide basis.</p>
