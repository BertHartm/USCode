<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligible recipients; barter; estimates; reprocessing and other charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to prevent the waste of commodities whether in private stocks or acquired through price-support operations by the Commodity Credit Corporation before they can be disposed of in normal domestic channels without impairment of the price-support program or sold abroad at competitive world prices, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized, on such terms and under such regulations as the Secretary of Agriculture may deem in the public interest: (1) upon application, to make such commodities available to any Federal agency for use in making payment for commodities not produced in the United States; (2) to barter or exchange such commodities for strategic or other materials as authorized by law; (3) in the case of food commodities to donate such commodities to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and to such State, Federal, or private agency or agencies as may be designated by the proper State or Federal authority and approved by the Secretary, for use in the United States in nonprofit school-lunch programs, in nonprofit summer camps for children, in the assistance of needy persons, and in charitable institutions, including hospitals and facilities, to the extent that they serve needy persons (including infants and children). In the case of clause (3) the Secretary shall obtain such assurance as he deems necessary that the recipients thereof will not diminish their normal expenditures for food by reason of such donation. In order to facilitate the appropriate disposal of such commodities, the Secretary may from time to time estimate and announce the quantity of such commodities which he anticipates will become available for distribution under clause (3). The Commodity Credit Corporation may pay, with respect to commodities disposed of under this subsection, reprocessing, packaging, transporting, handling, and other charges accruing up to the time of their delivery to a Federal agency, or to the designated State or private agency. In addition, in the case of food commodities disposed of under this subsection, the Commodity Credit Corporation may pay the cost of processing such commodities into a form suitable for home or institutional use, such processing to be accomplished through private trade facilities to the greatest extent possible. For the purpose of this subsection the terms &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;United States&rdquo; include the District of Columbia and any Territory or possession of the United States. Dairy products acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation through price support operations may, insofar as they can be used in the United States in nonprofit school lunch and other nonprofit child feeding programs, in the assistance of needy persons, and in charitable institutions, including hospitals, to the extent that needy persons are served, be donated for any such use prior to any other use or disposition. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such dairy products may be donated for distribution to needy households in the United States and to meet the needs of persons receiving nutrition assistance under the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Furnishing of eligible commodities for carrying out programs of assistance in developing and friendly countries; availability of eligible commodities for nonprofit and voluntary agencies and cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, subject to the requirements of paragraph (10), may furnish eligible commodities for carrying out programs of assistance in developing countries and friendly countries under titles II and III of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq., 1727 et seq.] and under the Food for Progress Act of 1985 [7 U.S.C. 1736<em>o</em>], as approved by the Secretary, and for such purposes as are approved by the Secretary. To ensure that the furnishing of commodities under this subsection is coordinated with and complements other United States foreign assistance, assistance under this subsection shall be coordinated through the mechanism designated by the President to coordinate assistance under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.].</p>
<!-- PDFPage:657 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;eligible commodities&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) dairy products, wheat, rice, feed grains, and oilseeds acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation through price support operations, and the products thereof, that the Secretary determines meet the criteria specified in subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other edible agricultural commodities as may be acquired by the Secretary or the Commodity Credit Corporation in the normal course of operations and that are available for disposition under this subsection, except that no such commodities may be acquired for the purpose of their use under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Commodities may not be made available for disposition under this subsection in amounts that (i) will, in any way, reduce the amounts of commodities that traditionally are made available through donations to domestic feeding programs or agencies, or (ii) will prevent the Secretary from fulfilling any agreement entered into by the Secretary under a payment-in-kind program under this Act or other Acts administered by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The requirements of section 403(a) of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1733(a)] shall apply with respect to commodities furnished under this subsection. Commodities may not be furnished for disposition to any country under this subsection except on determinations by the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the receiving country has the absorptive capacity to use the commodities efficiently and effectively; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) such disposition of the commodities will not interfere with usual marketings of the United States, nor disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities and normal patterns of commercial trade with developing countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The requirement for safeguarding usual marketings of the United States shall not be used to prevent the furnishing under this subsection of any eligible commodity for use in countries that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) have not traditionally purchased the commodity from the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) do not have adequate financial resources to acquire the commodity from the United States through commercial sources or through concessional sales arrangements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall take reasonable precautions to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) commodities furnished under this subsection will not displace or interfere with sales that otherwise might be made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) sales or barter under paragraph (7) will not unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities nor normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If eligible commodities are made available under this subsection to a friendly country, nonprofit and voluntary agencies and cooperatives shall also be eligible to receive commodities for food aid programs in the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Agreements may be entered into under this subsection to provide eligible commodities in installments over an extended period of time. In agreements with recipients of eligible commodities under this subsection (including nonprofit and voluntary agencies or cooperatives), subject to the availability of commodities each fiscal year, the Secretary, on request, shall approve multiyear agreements to make agricultural commodities available for distribution or sale by the recipients if the agreements otherwise meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Sales and barter to finance the distribution, handling, and processing costs of the donated commodities or products in the importing country or in a country through which such commodities or products must be transshipped, or other activities in the importing country that are consistent with providing food assistance to needy people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Sales and barter of commodities and products furnished to intergovernmental agencies or organizations, insofar as they are consistent with normal programming procedures in the distribution of commodities by those agencies or organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) Sales of commodities and products furnished to nonprofit and voluntary agencies, or cooperatives, for food assistance under agreements that provide for the use, by the agency or cooperative, of foreign currency proceeds generated from such sale of commodities or products for the purposes established in clause (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Foreign currencies generated from partial or full sales or barter of commodities by a nonprofit and voluntary agency or cooperative shall be used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) to transport, store, distribute, and otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the use of commodities and the products thereof donated under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) to implement income generating, community development, health, nutrition, cooperative development, agricultural programs, and other developmental activities.</p>

The minimum allocation requirements of this clause apply with respect to commodities and products made available under this subsection for carrying out programs of assistance under titles II and III of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq., 1727 et seq.], and not with respect to commodities and products made available to carry out the Food for Progress Act of 1985 [7 U.S.C. 1736<em>o</em>].</p>
