<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Lines of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts in the Rural Business Investment Fund shall be used by the Board to provide lines of credit in amounts determined appropriate by the Board, but in no event shall any such line of credit exceed $750,000 annually (up to a total amount of $2,250,000) to an approved eligible entity. Each line of credit shall be made available over a period of time established by the Board for each such entity, but in no event shall any such period of time extend beyond the date on which the Investment Board is terminated under section 2007d(n) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amounts drawn from line</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts drawn from each line of credit by each approved eligible entity shall be used solely as provided under sections 2007a to 2007e of this title and shall be drawn only as needed to provide loans, investments, or to carry out a guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applications of eligible entities for lines of credit</h4>
