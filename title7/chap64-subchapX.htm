<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes, nature and construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to confer upon the Secretary general authority to enter into contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements to further the research, extension, or teaching programs in the food and agricultural sciences of the Department of Agriculture. This authority supplements all other laws relating to the Department of Agriculture and is not to be construed as limiting or repealing any existing authorities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of Secretary; legal effect of agreement; participation by other Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding chapter 63 of title 31, the Secretary may use a cooperative agreement as the legal instrument reflecting a relationship between the Secretary and a State cooperative institution, State department of agriculture, college, university, other research or educational institution or organization, Federal or private agency or organization, individual, or any other party, if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the objectives of the agreement will serve a mutual interest of the parties to the agreement in agricultural research, extension, <!-- PDFPage:1404 -->and teaching activities, including statistical reporting; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all parties will contribute resources to the accomplishment of those objectives.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal agency may participate in any such cooperative agreement by contributing funds through the appropriate agency of the Department of Agriculture or otherwise if it is mutually agreed that the objectives of the agreement will further the authorized programs of the contributing agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duration and eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, for periods not to exceed five years, with State agricultural experiment stations, State cooperative extension services, all colleges and universities, other research or education institutions and organizations, Federal and private agencies and organizations, individuals, and any other contractor or recipient, either foreign or domestic, to further research, extension, or teaching programs in the food and agricultural sciences of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Vesting of title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may vest title to expendable and nonexpendable equipment and supplies and other tangible personal property in the contractor or recipient when the contractor or recipient purchases such equipment, supplies, and property with contract, grant, or cooperative agreement funds and the Secretary deems such vesting of title a furtherance of the agricultural research, extension, or teaching objectives of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
