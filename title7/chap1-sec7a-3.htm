<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Election to register with the Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A board of trade that meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section may operate as an exempt board of trade on receipt from the board of trade of a notice, provided in such manner as the Commission may by rule or regulation prescribe, that the board of trade elects to operate as an exempt board of trade. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no provision of this chapter (other than subparagraphs (C) and (D) of sections 2(a)(1) and 16(e)(2)(B) of this title) shall apply with respect to a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or option on such a contract) traded on or through the facilities of an exempt board of trade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria for exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for an exemption under subsection (a) of this section, a board of trade shall limit trading on or through the facilities of the board of trade to contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or options on such contracts or on a commodity)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for which the underlying commodity has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a nearly inexhaustible deliverable supply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a deliverable supply that is sufficiently large, and a cash market sufficiently liquid, to render any contract traded on the commodity highly unlikely to be susceptible to the threat of manipulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) no cash market;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that are entered into only between persons that are eligible contract participants at the time at which the persons enter into the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that are not contracts of sale (or options on such a contract or on a commodity) for future delivery of any security, including any group or index of securities or any interest in, or based on the value of, any security or any group or index of securities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Antimanipulation requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A party to a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or option on such a contract <!-- PDFPage:57 -->or on a commodity) that is traded on an exempt board of trade shall be subject to sections 6b, 6c(b), 6<em>o</em>, 9, 15, and 13(a)(2) of this title, and the Commission shall enforce those provisions with respect to any such trading.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Price discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission finds that an exempt board of trade is a significant source of price discovery for transactions in the cash market for the commodity underlying any contract, agreement, or transaction traded on or through the facilities of the board of trade, the board of trade shall disseminate publicly on a daily basis trading volume, opening and closing price ranges, open interest, and other trading data as appropriate to the market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any account, agreement, contract, or transaction involving a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery, or option on such a contract or on a commodity, to the extent that the account, agreement, contract, or transaction is traded on an exempt board of trade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Subsidiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A board of trade that is designated as a contract market or registered as a derivatives transaction execution facility may operate an exempt board of trade by establishing a separate subsidiary or other legal entity and otherwise satisfying the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Misrepresentation of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An exempt board of trade that meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall not represent to any person that the board of trade is registered with, or designated, recognized, licensed, or approved by the Commission.</p>
