<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), &ldquo;national marketing quota&rdquo; for any kind of tobacco for a marketing year means the amount of the kind of tobacco produced in the United States which the Secretary estimates will be utilized during the marketing year in the United States and will be exported during the marketing year, adjusted upward or downward in such amount as the Secretary, in his discretion, determines is desirable for the purpose of maintaining an adequate supply or for effecting an orderly reduction of supplies to the reserve supply level. Any such downward adjustment shall not exceed 15 per centum of such estimated utilization and exports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the 1986 and each subsequent crop of Flue-cured tobacco, &ldquo;national marketing quota&rdquo; for a marketing year means the quantity of Flue-cured tobacco, as determined by the Secretary, that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the aggregate of the quantities of Flue-cured tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettes estimate the manufacturers intend to purchase on the United States auction markets or from producers during the marketing year, as compiled and determined under section 1314g of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the average annual quantity of Flue-cured tobacco exported from the United States during the 3 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the quantity, if any, of Flue-cured tobacco that the Secretary, in the discretion of the Secretary, determines is necessary to increase or decrease the inventory of the producer-owned cooperative marketing association that has entered into a loan agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation to make price support available to producers of Flue-cured tobacco to establish or maintain such inventory at the reserve stock level for Flue-cured tobacco.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the national marketing quota for Flue-cured tobacco for each of the 1986 through 1989 marketing years for such tobacco shall not be less than 94 percent of the national marketing quota for such tobacco for the preceding marketing year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the national marketing quota for Flue-cured tobacco for each of the 1990 through 1996 marketing years for such tobacco shall not be less than 90 percent of the national marketing quota for such tobacco for the preceding marketing year, except that, in the case of each of the 1995 and 1996 crops of Flue-cured tobacco, the Secretary may waive the requirements of this clause if the Secretary determines that the requirements would likely result in inventories of the producer-owned cooperative marketing association for Flue-cured tobacco described in section 1314h(a)(2) of this title to exceed 150 percent of the reserve stock level for Flue-cured tobacco.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) &ldquo;National average yield goal&rdquo; for any kind of tobacco means the yield per acre which on a national average basis the Secretary determines will improve or insure the usability of the tobacco and increase the net return per pound to the growers. In making this determination the Secretary shall give consideration to such Federal-State production research data as he deems relevant. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in 1983,,<sup><a href="#1314c_1_target" name="1314c_1">1</a></sup> the national average yield goal for Flue-cured tobacco shall be adjusted by the Secretary to the past five years&rsquo; moving national average yield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) &ldquo;National acreage allotment&rdquo; means the acreage determined by dividing the national marketing quota by the national average yield goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) &ldquo;Farm acreage allotment&rdquo; for a tobacco farm, other than a new tobacco farm, means the acreage allotment determined by adjusting uniformly the acreage allotment established for such farm for the immediately preceding year, prior to any increase or decrease in such allotment due to undermarketings or overmarketings and prior to any reduction under subsection (f) of this section, so that the total of all allotments is equal to the national acreage allotment less the reserve provided in subsection (e) of this section with a further downward or upward adjustment to reflect any adjustment in the farm marketing quota for overmarketing or undermarketing and to reflect any reduction required under subsection (f) of this section, and including any adjustment for errors or inequities from the reserve. In determining farm acreage allotments for Flue-cured tobacco for 1965, the 1965 farm allotment determined under section 1313 of this title shall be adjusted in lieu of the acreage allotment for the immediately preceding year. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, in 1983,,<sup><a href="#1314c_1_target" name="1314c_1">1</a></sup> farm acreage allotments for Flue-cured tobacco for farms in each county shall be adjusted by the Secretary to reflect the increases or decreases in the past five years&rsquo; moving county average yield per acre, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of actual yields of farms in the county, or, if such information is not available, on such other data on yields as the Secretary may deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The &ldquo;community average yield&rdquo; means for Flue-cured tobacco the average yield per acre in the community designated by the Secretary as a local administrative area under the provisions of section 590h(b) of title 16 which is determined by averaging the yields per acre for the three highest years of the five years 1959 to 1963, inclusive, except that if the yield for any of the three highest years is less than 80 per centum of the average for the three years then that year or years shall be eliminated and the average of the remaining years shall be the community aver<!-- PDFPage:523 -->age yield. Community average yields for other kinds of tobacco shall be determined in like manner, except that the five years 1960 to 1964, inclusive, may be used instead of the period 1959 to 1963, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) &ldquo;Preliminary farm yield&rdquo; for Flue-cured tobacco means a farm yield per acre determined by averaging the yield per acre for the three highest years of the five consecutive crop years beginning with the 1959 crop year except that if that average exceeds 120 per centum of the community average yield the preliminary farm yield shall be the sum of 50 per centum of the average of the three highest years and 50 per centum of the national average yield goal but not less than 120 per centum of the community average yield, and if the average of the three highest years is less than 80 per centum of the community average yield the preliminary farm yield shall be 80 per centum of the community average yield. In counties where less than five hundred acres of Flue-cured tobacco were allotted for 1964, the county may be considered as one community. If Flue-cured tobacco was not produced on the farm for at least three years of the five-year period the average of the yields for the years in which tobacco was produced shall be used instead of the three-year average. If no Flue-cured tobacco was produced on the farm in the five-year period but the farm is eligible for an allotment because Flue-cured tobacco was considered to have been produced under applicable provisions of law, a preliminary farm yield for the farm shall be determined under regulations of the Secretary taking into account preliminary farm yields of similar farms in the community. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, in 1983, preliminary farm yields for Flue-cured tobacco farms in each county shall be adjusted by the Secretary by the reciprocal of the factor computed in paragraph (4) of this subsection to adjust farm acreage allotments to reflect increases or decreases in the past five years&rsquo; moving county average yields.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) &ldquo;Preliminary farm yield&rdquo; for kinds of tobacco, other than Flue-cured, means a farm yield per acre determined in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (6) except that in lieu of the five consecutive crop years beginning with 1959 the immediately preceding 5 crop years shall be used by the Secretary. In counties where less than five hundred acres of the kind of tobacco for which the determination is being made were allotted in the last year of the five-year period the county may be considered as one community. If tobacco of the kind for which the determination is being made was not produced on the farm for at least three years of the five-year period, the average of the yields for the years in which the kind of tobacco was produced shall be used instead of the three-year average. If no tobacco of the kind for which the determination is being made was produced on the farm in the five-year period but the farm is eligible for an allotment because such tobacco was considered to have been produced under applicable provisions of law, a preliminary farm yield for the farm shall be determined under regulations of the Secretary taking into account preliminary farm yields of similar farms in the community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) &ldquo;Farm yield&rdquo; means the yield of tobacco per acre for a farm determined by multiplying the preliminary farm yield by a national yield factor which shall be obtained by dividing the national average yield goal by a weighted national average yield computed by multiplying the preliminary farm yield for each farm by the acreage allotment determined pursuant to paragraph (4) for the farm prior to adjustments for overmarketing, undermarketing, or reductions required under subsection (f) of this section and dividing the sum of the products by the national acreage allotment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) &ldquo;Farm marketing quota&rdquo; for any farm for any marketing year shall be the number of pounds of tobacco obtained by multiplying the farm yield by the acreage allotment prior to any adjustment for undermarketing or overmarketing, increased for undermarketing or decreased for overmarketing by the number of pounds by which marketings of tobacco from the farm during the immediately preceding marketing year, if marketing quotas were in effect under the program established by this section, is less than or exceeds the farm marketing quota for such year: <em>Provided</em>, That the farm marketing quota for any marketing year shall not be increased for undermarketing by an amount in excess of the number of pounds determined by multiplying the acreage allotment for the farm for the immediately preceding year prior to any increase or decrease for undermarketing or overmarketing by the farm yield. If on account of excess marketings in the preceding marketing year the farm marketing quota for the marketing year is reduced to zero pounds without reflecting the entire reduction required, the additional reduction required shall be made for the subsequent marketing year or years. The farm marketing quota will be increased or decreased for the second succeeding marketing year in the case of Maryland tobacco, and for any other kind of tobacco for which the Secretary determines it is impracticable because of the lack of adequate marketing data, to make the increases or decreases applicable to the immediately succeeding marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) National marketing quota, acreage allotment and average yield goal for Flue-cured tobacco; referendum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within thirty days after April 16, 1965 the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall determine and announce the amount of the national marketing quota for Flue-cured tobacco for the marketing year beginning July 1, 1965, and the national acreage allotment and national average yield goal for the 1965 crop of Flue-cured tobacco, and within thirty days after the announcement of the amount of such national marketing quota shall conduct a special referendum of the farmers engaged in the production of Flue-cured tobacco of the 1964 crop to determine whether they favor or oppose the establishment of marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis as provided in this section for the marketing years beginning July 1, 1965, July 1, 1966, and July 1, 1967, in lieu of quotas on an acreage basis in effect for those marketing years. If the Secretary determines that more than 662/3 per centum of the farmers <!-- PDFPage:524 -->voting in the special referendum approve marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis, marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis as provided in this section shall be in effect for those marketing years and the marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall cease to be in effect at the beginning of such three-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tobacco having marketing quotas on acreage basis; determination of Secretary of program on acreage-poundage basis; announcement of national marketing quota, acreage allotment and average yield goal; referendum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, during the first or second marketing year of the three-year period for which marketing quotas on an acreage basis are in effect for any kind of tobacco, including Flue-cured tobacco, the Secretary, in his discretion, determines with respect to that kind of tobacco that acreage-poundage quotas under this section would result in a more effective marketing quota program for that kind of tobacco he shall at the time&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1314c_2_target" name="1314c_2">2</a></sup> the next announcement of the amount of the national marketing quota under section 1312(b) of this title determine and announce the amount of the national quota for that kind of tobacco under this section and at the same time announce the national acreage allotment and national average yield goal and within forty-five days thereafter conduct a special referendum of farmers engaged in the production of the kind of tobacco of the most recent crop to determine whether they favor the establishment of marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis as provided in this section for the next three marketing years: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary shall not make any such determination with respect to any kind of tobacco except Flue-cured tobacco unless prior thereto he shall conduct public hearings in the areas where such tobacco is produced for the purpose of ascertaining and taking into consideration the attitudes of producers and other interested persons with respect to acreage-poundage quotas. If the Secretary determines that more than 662/3 per centum of the farmers voting in the special referendum approve marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis as provided in this section, quotas on that basis shall be in effect for the next three marketing years and the marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall cease to be in effect at the beginning of such three-year period. If marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis are not approved by more than 662/3 per centum of the farmers voting in such referendum, the marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall continue in effect as theretofore proclaimed under section 1312(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Proclamation of national marketing quota for three years following last year of three years of acreage-poundage quotas; referendum; notice of farm marketing quota to farm operators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If marketing quotas have been made effective for a kind of tobacco on an acreage-poundage basis pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) of this section the Secretary shall, not later than December 15 of any marketing year with respect to Flue-cured tobacco, and March 1 with respect to other kinds of tobacco, proclaim a national marketing quota for that kind of tobacco for the next three succeeding marketing years if the marketing year is the last year of three consecutive years for which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the proclamation of the national marketing quota for the 1986 crop of Flue-cured tobacco may be made not later than December 31, 1985. The Secretary, in his discretion, may proclaim the quota on an acreage-poundage basis as provided in this section or on an acreage allotment basis, whichever he determines would result in a more effective marketing quota for that kind of tobacco, and shall conduct a referendum in accordance with the provisions of section 1312(c) of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence or section 1312(c) of this title, the referendum with respect to national marketing quotas for Flue-cured tobacco for the 1986 through 1988 marketing years may be conducted not later than the earlier of (1) thirty days after any proclamation of the national marketing quota for Flue-cured tobacco for the 1986 marketing year made after January 30, 1986, or (2) March 15, 1986. If the Secretary determines that more than one-third of the farmers voting oppose the national marketing quotas the results shall be proclaimed and the national marketing quota so proclaimed shall not be in effect. If the Secretary proclaims the quotas on an acreage-poundage basis he shall determine and proclaim at the same time the national marketing quota, national acreage allotment, and national average yield goal for the first year of the three years for which quotas are proclaimed. Notice of the farm marketing quota which will be in effect for his farm for the first marketing year covered by the referendum insofar as practicable shall be mailed to the farm operator prior to the holding of any special referendum under subsection (b) of this section or a referendum on acreage-poundage quotas under this subsection, and at least 15 days prior to the holding of any special referendum under subsection (c) of this section. The Secretary shall determine and announce the national marketing quota, national acreage allotment and national average yield goal for the second and third marketing years of any three-year period for which national marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis are in effect on or before the December 15 with respect to Flue-cured tobacco and the March 1 with respect to other kinds of tobacco immediately preceding the beginning of the marketing year to which they apply. Whenever a national marketing quota, national acreage allotment, and national average yield goal are determined and announced, the Secretary shall provide for the determination of farm acreage allotments and farm marketing quotas under the provisions of this section for the crop and marketing year covered by the determinations. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the 1986 marketing year, the Secretary shall proclaim the national marketing quota for Flue-cured tobacco not later than 21 days after April 7, 1986. Any proclamation with respect to the national marketing quota for the 1986 mar<!-- PDFPage:525 -->keting year for Flue-cured tobacco made by the Secretary prior to April 7, 1986, shall become void on April 7, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonestablishment of farm acreage allotment or farm yield for farms without tobacco production for five years; reserve; &ldquo;new farms&rdquo; defined; acreage allotment and farm yield basis of new farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No farm acreage allotment or farm yield shall be established for a farm on which no tobacco was produced or considered produced under applicable provisions of law for the immediately preceding five years. For each marketing year for which acreage-poundage quotas are in effect under this section the Secretary in his discretion may establish a reserve from the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 3 per centum of the national acreage allotment to be available for making corrections of errors in farm acreage allotments, adjusting inequities, and for establishing acreage allotments for new farms, which are farms on which tobacco was not produced or considered produced during the immediately preceding five years (except that not less than two-thirds of such reserve shall be for new farms). The part of the reserve held for apportionment to new farms shall be allotted on the basis of land, labor, and equipment available for the production of tobacco, crop rotation practices, soil and other physical factors affecting the production of tobacco and the past tobacco-producing experience of the farm operator. The farm yield for any farm for which a new farm acreage allotment is established shall be determined on the basis of available productivity data for the land involved and farm yields for similar farms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Acreage reduction penalties applicable to acreage-poundage programs; farm marketing quota reductions; filing false reports; increases or decreases in acreage allotments and farm yields for other farms of owner displaced by agency acquisition of farms; leases and sales of acreage allotments and farm marketing quotas; ratification of transfers of acreage allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Only the provisions of the last two sentences of subsection (g) of section 1313 of this title shall apply with respect to acreage-poundage programs established under this section. The acreage reductions required under the last two sentences shall be in addition to any other adjustments made pursuant to this section, and when acreage reductions are made the farm marketing quota shall be reduced to reflect such reductions. The provisions of the next to the last sentence of such subsection pertaining to the filing of any false report with respect to the acreage of tobacco grown on the farm shall also be applicable to the filing of any false report with respect to the production or marketings of tobacco grown on a farm for which an acreage allotment and a farm yield are established as provided in this section. In establishing acreage allotments and farm yields for other farms owned by the owner displaced by acquisition of his land by any agency, as provided in section 1378 of this title, increases or decreases in such acreage allotments and farm yields as provided in this section shall be made on account of marketings below or in excess of the farm marketing quota for the farm acquired by the agency. Acreage allotments and farm marketing quotas determined under this section may (except in the case of kinds of tobacco not subject to section 1314b of this title) be leased and sold under the terms and conditions contained in section 1314b of this title, except that (1) the adjustment provided for in the last sentence of subsection (c) of said section shall be based on farm yields rather than normal yields, and (2) any credit for undermarketing or charge for overmarketing shall be attributed to the farm to which transferred. Transfers of acreage allotments for 1965 under section 1314b of this title on the basis of leases executed prior to the effective date of a program for the 1965 crop of Flue-cured tobacco under this section may be approved or ratified by the county committee for the purposes of this section, but the amount of allotment transferred shall be increased or decreased in the same proportion that the allotment of the farm from which it is transferred is increased or decreased under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Marketing penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When marketing quotas under this section are in effect, provisions with respect to penalties for the marketing of excess tobacco and the other provisions contained in section 1314 of this title shall apply, except that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No penalty on excess tobacco shall be due or collected until 103 per centum (120 per centum in the case of Burley tobacco for the first year for which marketing quotas are made effective under this section) of the farm marketing quota for a farm has been marketed, but with respect to each pound of tobacco marketed in excess of such percentage the full penalty rate shall be due, payable, and collected at the time of marketing on each pound of tobacco marketed, and any tobacco marketed in excess of 100 per centum of the farm marketing quota will require a reduction in subsequent farm marketing quotas in accordance with subsection (a)(8) of this section: <em>Provided, however</em>, If the Secretary, in his discretion, determines it is desirable to encourage the marketing of grade N<sup></sup><strong>2</strong> tobacco, or any grade of tobacco not eligible for price support, in order to meet the normal demands of export and domestic markets, he may authorize the marketing of such tobacco in a marketing year without the payment of penalty or deduction from subsequent quotas to the extent of 5 per centum of the farm marketing quota for the farm on which the tobacco was produced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When marketing quotas established under this section are in effect the provisions with respect to penalties contained in the third sentence of section 1314(a) of this title shall be revised to read: &ldquo;If any producer falsely identifies or fails to account for the disposition of any tobacco, the Secretary, in lieu of assessing and collecting penalties based on actual marketings of excess tobacco, may elect to assess a penalty computed by multiplying the full penalty rate by an amount of tobacco equal to 25 per centum of the farm marketing quota plus the farm yield of the number of acres harvested in excess of the farm acreage allotment and the penalty in respect thereof shall be paid and remitted by the producer.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:526 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) For the first year a marketing quota program established under the provisions of this section is in effect, the words &ldquo;normal production&rdquo; where they appear in the fourth sentence of subsection (a) of section 1314 of this title shall be read &ldquo;farm yield&rdquo; and the said fourth sentence shall otherwise be applicable. For the second and succeeding years for which a program established under the provisions of this section is in effect, the provisions of subsection (a)(8) of this section apply when penalties, if any, on carryover tobacco are computed, and the provisions contained in the fourth sentence of section 1314(a) of this title shall not be applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Burley tobacco; acreage-poundage basis: farm acreage allotment and farm marketing quota, adjustments for overmarketing or undermarketing, reductions for violations; acreage and quota additional to national acreage allotment and national marketing quota; acreage basis: acreage allotment, amendment of clause (1) and proviso of section 1315</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for any year subsequent to the first year for which marketing quotas are made effective under this section for Burley tobacco&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the farm acreage allotment for Burley tobacco under this section shall not be less than the smallest of (A) the acreage allotment established for the farm for such first year, (B) five-tenths of an acre, or (C) 10 per centum of the cropland; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the farm marketing quota for Burley tobacco under this section shall not be less than the minimum allotment provided by clause (1) multiplied by the farm yield established for such first year for such farm.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Farm acreage allotments and marketing quotas to which the provisions of (1) and (2) are applicable shall be subject to adjustment for overmarketing or undermarketing or reductions required by subsection (f) of this section. The additional acreage and quotas required under the subsection shall be in addition to the national acreage allotment and national marketing quota.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary proclaims a quota on an acreage allotment basis (in lieu of on an acreage poundage basis)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the minimum acreage allotment for Burley tobacco for any farm shall be determined under the provisions of section 1315 of this title instead of under the preceding provisions of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) clause (1) of section 1315 of this title shall for such purpose read as follows: &ldquo;(1) the allotment established for the farm for the last preceding year for which a quota was proclaimed on an acreage allotment basis&rdquo;; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the proviso of section 1315 of this title shall for such purpose read as follows: <em>&ldquo;Provided, however</em>, That no allotment of seven-tenths of an acre or less shall be reduced more than one-tenth of an acre below the allotment established for the farm for the last preceding year for which a quota was proclaimed on an acreage allotment basis&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Consultations with industry representatives respecting a program for each kind of tobacco, studies of Flue-cured tobacco acreage-poundage program, report and recommendations to congressional committees, upon referendum approval of Flue-cured tobacco acreage-poundage program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an acreage-poundage program for Flue-cured tobacco is approved by growers voting in the special referendum under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall not later than January 1, 1966&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Consult with representatives of all segments of the tobacco industry, including growers, State farm organizations, and cooperative associations, in meetings held for each kind of tobacco, to receive their recommendations and to determine the need for a similar or modified program for that kind of tobacco.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Conduct a study and report to the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on experience with and operation of the program, and make recommendations for any modifications needed to improve the program, including alternatives adapted to the different needs of other kinds of tobacco.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Treatment of falsely identified tobacco for purposes of establishing future farm marketing quotas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a producer falsely identifies tobacco as having been produced on or marketed from a farm, the quantity of tobacco so falsely identified shall be considered for purposes of establishing future farm marketing quotas, as having been produced on both the farm for which it was identified as having been produced and the farm of actual production, if known, or, as the case may be, shall be considered as actually marketed from the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Forfeiture of allotment and quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who, on or after January 1, 1986, owns a farm for which a Flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment or marketing quota is established under this chapter shall, subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, forfeit such allotment or quota after February 15 of any year immediately following the last year of the three-year period immediately preceding the year for which the determination is being made in which Flue-cured tobacco has not been planted or considered planted on such farm during at least two years out of such three-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The allotment or quota specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be forfeited if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the appropriate county committee determines that the conditions for forfeiture specified in such paragraph exist. Any allotment or quota so forfeited shall be reallocated by such county committee for use by active Flue-cured tobacco producers (as defined in section 1314b(g)(1) of this title) in the county involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notice of any determination made by the county committee under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be mailed, as soon as practicable, to the person involved. If such person is <!-- PDFPage:527 -->dissatisfied with such determination, such person may request, within fifteen days after notice of such determination is mailed, a review of such determination by a local review committee under section 1363 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Determination of Flue-cured tobacco planted acreage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall determine the acreage planted to Flue-cured tobacco on each farm whenever an acreage-poundage program for Flue-cured tobacco is in effect under this section.</p>
