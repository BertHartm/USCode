<p class="statutory-body-1em">The order shall provide for the establishment of, and appointment of members to, a United Soybean Board to administer the order. Members of the Board shall be soybean producers appointed by the Secretary, on a geographic basis, from State or combined units, as provided in this subsection. The cumulative number of seats on the Board shall be the total number of seats to which all the units are entitled.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Seats</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish State units and combined units and seats on the Board for such units, as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) State units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each State shall be considered as a unit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Combined units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State in which average annual soybean production is less than 3,000,000 bushels shall be grouped with other States into a combined unit. To the extent practicable, each State with average annual soybean production of less than 3,000,000 bushels shall be grouped with other States with average annual soybean production of less than 3,000,000 bushels into a combined unit, in a manner prescribed in the order, and each combined unit shall consist of geographically contiguous States. To the extent practicable, each combined unit shall have an average annual production of soybeans of at least 3,000,000 bushels.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Number of seats per unit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (F), each unit, as established under subparagraph (A) or (B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if its average annual soybean production is less than 15,000,000 bushels, shall be entitled to one seat on the Board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if its average annual soybean production is 15,000,000 bushels or more but less than 70,000,000 bushels, shall be entitled to 2 seats on the Board;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Determination of average annual soybean production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (F), the Secretary shall determine average annual soybean production applicable to a crop year by using the average of the 5 previous crops of soybeans, excluding the crop in which production was the highest and the crop in which production was the lowest.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Reapportionment of seats</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At the end of each 3 year period beginning with the 3 year period starting on the effective date of the order, the Secretary, if necessary, shall adjust any unit to conform with subparagraphs (A) and (B). If the Secretary makes such an adjustment, the Secretary shall reapportion the seats on the Board to conform with subparagraph (C) and any modifications made under subparagraph (F). If payment of refunds following the initial referendum conducted under section 6305(a) of this title is authorized by producers, in making such adjustments, the Secretary shall exclude, from each State's annual soybean production, those bushels of soybeans on which such refunds are paid.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Adjustment of levels of production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At the end of each 3 year period beginning with the 3 year period starting on the effective date of the order, the Board may recommend to the Secretary, to the extent it determines appropriate, changes in the levels of production used in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to determine per-unit representation on the Board. The Secretary may amend the order to make such changes in levels of production used to determine per-unit representation. Any such amendment to the order shall not be subject to a referendum of producers. A unit may not, as a result of any modification under this subparagraph, lose Board seats to which it is entitled at the time the order is initially issued unless its average annual production, as determined under subparagraph (D), declines below the levels required for representation, as specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Nominations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall appoint soybean producers to seats established under paragraph (2) from nominations submitted by each unit.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Representation of certain States</h4>
