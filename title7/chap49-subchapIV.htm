<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;seasoned direct loan borrower&rdquo; means a borrower receiving a direct loan under this chapter who has been classified as &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; or &ldquo;standard&rdquo; under subpart W of part 2006 of the Instruction Manual (as in effect on January 1, 1991).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, or a contracting third party, shall annually review under section 2006b of this title the loans of each seasoned loan borrower. If, based on the review, it is determined that a borrower would be able to obtain a loan, guaranteed by the Secretary, from a commercial or cooperative lender at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, the Secretary shall assist the borrower in applying for the commercial or cooperative loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In accordance with section 2006d of this title, the Secretary shall prepare a prospectus on each seasoned direct loan borrower determined eligible to obtain a guaranteed loan. The prospectus shall contain a description of the amounts of loan guarantee and interest assistance that the Secretary will provide to the seasoned direct loan borrower to enable the seasoned direct loan borrower to carry out a financially viable farming plan if a guaranteed loan is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) With the approval of the borrower, the Secretary shall provide the prospectus of the seasoned direct loan borrower to each approved lender whose lending area includes the location of the seasoned direct loan borrower. If the Secretary receives an offer from an approved lender to extend credit to the seasoned direct loan borrower under terms and conditions contained in the prospectus, the seasoned direct loan borrower shall not be eligible for an insured loan from the Secretary under subchapter I or II of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Secretary is unable to provide loan guarantees and, if necessary, interest assistance to the seasoned direct loan borrower under this subsection in amounts sufficient to enable the seasoned direct loan borrower to borrow from commercial sources the amount required to carry out a financially viable farming plan, or if the Secretary does not receive an offer from an approved lender to extend credit to a seasoned direct loan borrower under the terms and conditions contained in the prospectus, the Secretary shall make an insured loan to the seasoned direct loan borrower under subchapter I or II of this chapter, whichever is applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) To the extent necessary for the borrower to obtain a loan, guaranteed by the Secretary, from a commercial or cooperative lender, the Secretary shall provide interest rate reductions as provided for under section 1999 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Simplified application for guaranteed loans of $50,000 or less</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the form can be completed manually or electronically, at the option of the lender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the form minimizes the documentation required to accompany the form;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized and empowered to make advances, without regard to any loan or total indebtedness limitation, to preserve and protect the security for or the lien or priority of the lien securing any loan or other indebtedness owing to, insured by, or acquired by the Secretary under this chapter or under any other programs administered by the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration; to bid for and purchase at any execution, foreclosure, or other sale or otherwise to acquire property upon which the United States has a lien by reason of a judgment or execution arising from, or which is pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, attached, or levied upon to secure the payment of, any such indebtedness whether or not such property is subject to other liens, to accept title to any property so purchased or acquired; and to sell, manage, or otherwise dispose of such property as hereinafter provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, real property administered under the provisions of this chapter may be operated or leased by the Secretary for such period or periods as the Secretary may deem necessary to protect the Government's investment therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary may determine whether real property administered under this chapter is suitable for disposition to persons eligible for assistance under the provisions of any law administered by the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration. The County Committee shall classify or reclassify real property (including real property administered by the Secretary on January 6, 1988) that is farmland, as being suitable for farming operation for such disposition unless the property, including property subdivided in accordance with subsection (e)(5) of this section, cannot be used to meet any of the purposes of section 1923 of this title (including being used as a start-up or add-on parcel of farmland). Any property which the Secretary determines to be suitable for such purposes shall, whenever practicable, be sold by the Secretary as expeditiously as possible to such eligible persons in a manner consistent with such provisions. Real property which is not determined suitable for sale to such eligible persons or which has not been purchased by such persons within a period of 12 months from the date first published under paragraph (2)(D), shall be (A) sold by the Secretary after public notice at public sale and, if no acceptable bid is received then by negotiated sale, at the best price obtainable for cash or on <!-- PDFPage:984 -->secured credit without regard to the laws governing the disposition of excess or surplus property of the United States or (B) leased to persons eligible for assistance under the provisions of any law administered by the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration under an annual lease or a lease with an option to purchase, with a preference for sale. The terms of such sale shall require an initial downpayment and the remainder of the sales price payable in installments with interest on unpaid balance at the rate determined by the Secretary, but not in any event at rates and terms more favorable than those legally permissible for eligible borrowers. Any conveyances under this section shall include all of the interest of the United States, including mineral rights, other than easements acquired under section 1997 of this title. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Secretary may for conservation purposes grant or sell an easement, restriction, development rights, or the equivalent thereof, to a unit of local or State government or a private nonprofit organization separately from the underlying fee or sum of all other rights possessed by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall sell suitable farmland administered under this chapter to persons in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Qualified beginning farmers or ranchers (as defined pursuant to section 1991(a)(8) of this title), as of the time immediately after such contract for sale or lease is entered into, as determined by the county committee.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In selling such land, the county committee shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) grant a priority to persons eligible for loans under subchapter I of this chapter, including individuals approved for, but who, as of January 6, 1988, have not yet received, such loans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) offer such land&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) for sales pursuant to subsection (e)(1)(C) of this section, at a price not greater than that which reflects the appraised market value of such farmland; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) for all other sales, at a price not greater than that which reflects the fair market value of such land as determined by bids after advertising or by negotiated sale;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) select from among qualified applicants the applicant who has the greatest need for farm income and best meets the criteria for eligibility to receive loans under subchapter I of this chapter, except that if the committee determines that two or more applicants meet the loan eligibility criteria, the committee shall select between the qualified applicants on a random basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) publish or cause to be published three consecutive weekly announcements at least twice annually of the availability of such farmland, in at least one newspaper that is widely circulated in the county in which the land is located until the property is sold.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) With respect to any real property administered under this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to grant or sell easements or rights-of-way for roads, utilities, and other appurtenances not inconsistent with the public interest. With respect to any rights-of-way over land on which the United States has a lien administered under this chapter, the Secretary may release said lien upon payment to the United States of adequate consideration, and the interest of the United States arising under any such lien may be acquired for highway purposes by any State or political subdivision thereof in condemnation proceedings under State law by service by certified mail upon the United States attorney for the district, the State Director of the Farmers Home Administration for the State in which the farm is located, and the Attorney General of the United States: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the United States shall not be required to appear, answer, or respond to any notice or writ sooner than ninety days from the time such notice or writ is returnable or purports to be effective, and the taking or vesting of title to the interest of the United States shall not become final under any proceeding, order, or decree until adequate compensation and damages have been finally determined and paid to the United States or into the registry of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1)(A)(i) During the 180-day period beginning on the date of acquisition, or during the applicable period under State law, the Secretary shall allow the borrower-owner (as defined in subparagraph (F)) to purchase or lease such property, if such borrower-owner has acted in good faith with the Secretary, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary, in connection with such loan.</p>

All haying and grazing practices on the wetlands (including the timing and intensity of haying and grazing) shall conform to forage management standards designed to protect wetlands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, despite the limitations contained in paragraph (3), wetland conservation easements established under paragraph (1) would prevent a particular parcel of inventoried property that is to be sold or leased to a borrower described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subsection (e)(1)(C) of this section, or to a borrower who is a beginning farmer or rancher, from being a marketable agricultural production unit that is comparable to the parcel as acquired, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary shall provide prior written notification to a borrower considering preservation loan servicing that a wetlands conservation easement may be placed on land for which the borrower is negotiating a lease option.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The appraised value of the farm shall reflect the value of the land due to the placement of wetland conservation easements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Notwithstanding the limitations described under paragraphs (3) and (4), the limitations may be voluntarily, knowingly waived by any person with respect to real property described in paragraph (3) or (4).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2001. Debt restructuring and loan servicing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall modify delinquent farmer program loans made or insured under this chapter, or purchased from the lender or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 1929b of this title, to the maximum extent possible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to avoid losses to the Secretary on such loans, with priority consideration being placed on writing-down the loan principal and interest (subject to subsections (d) and (e) of this section), and debt set-aside (subject to subsection (e) of this section), whenever these procedures would facilitate keeping the borrower on the farm or ranch, or otherwise through the use of primary loan service programs as provided in this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure that borrowers are able to continue farming or ranching operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to obtain assistance under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the delinquency must be due to circumstances beyond the control of the borrower, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary, except that the regulations shall require that, if the value of the assets calculated under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section that may be realized through liquidation or other methods would produce enough income to make the delinquent loan current, the borrower shall not be eligible for assistance under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower must have acted in good faith with the Secretary in connection with the loan as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the borrower must present a preliminary plan to the Secretary that contains reasonable assumptions that demonstrate that the borrower will be able to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) meet the necessary family living and farm operating expenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) service all debts, including those of the loans restructured; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the loan, if restructured, must result in a net recovery to the Federal Government, during the term of the loan as restructured, that would be more than or equal to the net recovery to the Federal Government from an involuntary liquidation or foreclosure on the property securing the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restructuring determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of net recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the net recovery from the involuntary liquidation of a loan under this section, the Secretary shall calculate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan, in accordance with paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of the restructured loan, in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recovery value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of paragraph (1), the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the amount of the current appraised value of the interests of the borrower in the property securing the loan; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the value of the interests of the borrower in all other assets that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) not essential for necessary family living expenses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) not essential to the operation of the farm; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) not exempt from judgment creditors or in a bankruptcy action under Federal or State law; less</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1008 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the estimated administrative, legal, and other expenses associated with the liquidation and disposition of the loan and collateral, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the payment of prior liens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) taxes and assessments, depreciation, management costs, the yearly percentage decrease or increase in the value of the property, and lost interest income, each calculated for the average holding period for the type of property involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) resale expenses, such as repairs, commissions, and advertising; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) other administrative and attorney's costs; plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the value, as determined by the Secretary, of any property not included in subparagraph (A)(i) if the property is specified in any security agreement with respect to such loan and the Secretary determines that the value of such property should be included for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Value of the restructured loan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of paragraph (1), the value of the restructured loan shall be based on the present value of payments that the borrower would make to the Federal Government if the terms of such loan were modified under any combination of primary loan service programs to ensure that the borrower is able to meet such obligations and continue farming operations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Present value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of calculating the present value referred to in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall use a discount rate of not more than the current rate on 90-day Treasury bills.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Debt service margin</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Assumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For the purpose of assessing under subparagraph (A) the ability of a borrower to meet debt obligations and continue farming operations, the Secretary shall assume that the borrower needs up to 105 percent of the amount indicated for payment of debt obligations.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Available income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If an amount up to 105 percent of the debt payments of the borrower has been earmarked for such payments, the Secretary shall consider the income of the borrower to be adequate to meet the debt obligations of the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 90 days after receipt of a written request for restructuring from the borrower, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make the calculations specified in paragraphs (2) and (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notify the borrower in writing of the results of such calculations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide documentation for the calculations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Restructuring of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the value of the restructured loan is greater than or equal to the recovery value, the Secretary shall, within 45 days after notifying the borrower of such calculations, offer to restructure the loan obligations of the borrower under this chapter through primary loan service programs that would enable the borrower to meet the obligations (as modified) under the loan and to continue the farming operations of the borrower. If the borrower accepts such offer, within 45 days after receipt of notice of acceptance, the Secretary shall restructure the loan accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Termination of loan obligations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Required conditions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the obligations of a borrower to the Secretary under a restructured loan shall terminate if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the borrower satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the value of the restructured loan is less than the recovery value; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) within 90 days after receipt of the notification described in paragraph (4)(B), the borrower pays (or obtains third-party financing to pay) the Secretary an amount equal to the recovery value.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limited applicability of good faith requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Clause (i)(I) shall not apply to any offer of net recovery buyout made by the Secretary under this section before November 28, 1990, unless the Secretary, before such date, determined that the borrower involved did not act in good faith with respect to the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Recapture</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Authority to require borrower to enter into agreement before terminating loan obligations</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary may require, as a condition of the termination of loan obligations under this paragraph, that the borrower enter into an agreement with the Secretary providing that if the borrower sells or otherwise conveys the real property used to secure such loan within 10 years after the date of such agreement, and realizes a gain on such sale or conveyance over the amount of the recovery value of the loan, then the Secretary may recapture part or all of the difference between the recovery value of the loan and the fair market value (on the date of such sale or conveyance) of the property securing the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Limitation on recapture amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The agreement described in subclause (I) shall not provide for recapture of an amount that exceeds the difference between such recovery value and the outstanding balance of principal and interest owed on the loan immediately prior to the termination of any loan obligations under this paragraph.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1009 --><h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Treatment of intrafamily transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i)(I), transfer of title to a property, on the death or retirement of the borrower, to a spouse or child of the borrower who is actively engaged in farming on the property shall not be treated as a sale or conveyance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Negotiation of appraisal</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a determination concerning restructuring under this subsection, the Secretary, at the request of the borrower, shall enter into negotiations concerning appraisals required under this subsection with the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Independent appraisal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the borrower, based on a separate current appraisal, objects to the decision of the Secretary regarding an appraisal, the borrower and the Secretary shall mutually agree, to the extent practicable, on an independent appraiser who shall conduct another appraisal of the borrower's property. The average of the two appraisals that are closest in value shall become the final appraisal under this paragraph. The borrower and the Secretary shall each pay one-half of the cost of the independent appraisal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Principal and interest write-down</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Priority consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In selecting the restructuring alternatives to be used in the case of a borrower who has requested restructuring under this section, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to the use of principal and interest write-down, except that this procedure shall not be given first priority in the case of a borrower unless other creditors of such borrower (other than those creditors who are fully collateralized) representing a substantial portion of the total debt of the borrower held by such creditors, agree to participate in the development of the restructuring plan or agree to participate in a State mediation program.</p>
