Any judge of the United States or of a court of record of any State, territory, or district, or a United States commissioner, may, within his respective jurisdiction, upon proper oath or affirmation showing probable cause to believe that there are on certain premises any products, articles, means of conveyance, or noxious weeds subject to this chapter, issue warrants for the entry of such premises for purposes of any inspection or other action necessary under this chapter, except as otherwise provided in section 2808 of this title. Such warrants may be executed by any authorized inspector or any United States marshal.</p>
