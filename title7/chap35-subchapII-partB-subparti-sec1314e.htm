<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Proclamations and referenda regarding burley tobacco</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall, within thirty days following April 14, 1971, proclaim national marketing quotas for burley tobacco for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1971, and determine and announce the amount of the marketing quota for burley tobacco for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1971, as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of the farmers engaged in the production of the 1970 crop of burley tobacco to determine whether they favor or oppose the establishment of farm marketing quotas on a poundage basis as provided in this section for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1971. If the Secretary determines that two-thirds or more of the farmers voting in such referendum approve marketing quotas on a poundage basis, marketing quotas as provided in this section shall be in effect for those three marketing years. If marketing quotas on a poundage basis are not approved by at least two-thirds of the farmers voting in such referendum, no marketing quotas or price support for burley tobacco shall be in effect for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1971. Thereafter, the provisions of section 1312 of this title shall apply: <em>Provided</em>, That national marketing quotas for burley tobacco for any marketing year subsequent to the marketing year beginning October 1, 1971, shall be proclaimed as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall determine and announce, not later than the February 1 preceding the second and third marketing years of any three-year period for which marketing quotas on a poundage basis are in effect for burley tobacco under this section, the amount of the national marketing quota for each of such years. If marketing quotas have been made effective on a poundage basis for burley tobacco under this section, the Secretary shall, not later than February 1 of the last year of three consecutive marketing years for which marketing quotas are in effect for burley tobacco under this section, proclaim national marketing quotas for burley tobacco for the next three succeeding marketing years as provided in this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the proclamation of national marketing quotas for Burley tobacco for the 1986 through 1988 marketing years may be made not later than March 1, 1986. Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum in accordance with section 1312(c) of this title. If the Secretary determines that more than one-third of the farmers voting oppose the national marketing quotas, he shall announce the results and no marketing quotas or price support shall be in effect for bur<!-- PDFPage:530 -->ley tobacco for the first marketing year of such three-year period. Thereafter, the provisions of section 1312 of this title shall apply: <em>Provided</em>, That the national marketing quota and farm marketing quotas shall be determined for burley tobacco as provided in this section. Notice of the farm marketing quota which will be in effect for his farm for the first marketing year covered by any referendum under this section shall, insofar as practicable, be mailed to the farm operator in sufficient time to be received prior to the referendum. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the 1986 marketing year, the Secretary shall proclaim the national marketing quota for Burley tobacco not later than 21 days after April 7, 1986, or February 1, 1986, whichever is later. Any proclamation with respect to the national marketing quota for the 1986 marketing year for Burley tobacco made by the Secretary prior to April 7, 1986, shall become void on April 7, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proclamations and referenda regarding dark air-cured tobacco and types 22 and 23 fire-cured tobacco</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall, not later than February 1, 1983, proclaim national marketing quotas for dark air-cured tobacco and for fire-cured tobacco, types 22 and 23 (hereinafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;fire-cured tobacco&rdquo;) for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1983, and determine and announce the amount of the marketing quota for dark air-cured and for fire-cured tobacco for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1983, as provided in this section. Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of the farmers engaged in the production of the 1982 crop of each of such kinds of tobacco to determine whether they favor or oppose the establishment of farm marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco as provided in this section for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1983, in lieu of quotas on an acreage basis in effect for the two marketing years beginning October 1, 1983. If the Secretary determines that one-half or more of the farmers voting in such referendum approve marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco, then marketing quotas as provided in this section shall be in effect for such kind of tobacco for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1983, and marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall cease to be in effect for such kind of tobacco for the two marketing years beginning on October 1, 1983. If marketing quotas on a poundage basis are not approved for such kind of tobacco by at least one-half of the farmers voting in such referendum, then quotas on an acreage basis shall be in effect for such kind of tobacco for the two marketing years beginning October 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If marketing quotas on an acreage basis are in effect for any such kind of tobacco, if, for a period of not less than three marketing years, a referendum has not been held under this section to determine whether producers of such kind of tobacco favor marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco, and if the Secretary, after conducting public hearings in the area in which such kind of tobacco is produced, ascertains that producers and other interested persons favor marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco, then the Secretary shall, at the time of the next announcement of the amount of the national marketing quota, announce national marketing quotas for the next three succeeding marketing years under this section. Within thirty days of such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of farmers engaged in the production of the most recent crop of such kind of tobacco to determine whether they favor the establishment of marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco as provided in this section for the next three succeeding marketing years. If the Secretary determines that more than one-half of the farmers voting in such referendum approve marketing quotas on a poundage basis under this section, then quotas on that basis shall be in effect for the next three succeeding marketing years and the marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall cease to be in effect at the beginning of such three-year period. If marketing quotas on a poundage basis are not approved by more than one-half of the farmers voting in such referendum, then the marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall continue in effect as theretofore proclaimed under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall determine and announce, not later than the March 1 preceding the second and third marketing years of any three-year period for which marketing quotas on a poundage basis are in effect for any such kind of tobacco under this section, the amount of the national marketing quota for such kind of tobacco for each of such years. If marketing quotas on a poundage basis have been made effective for such kind of tobacco under this section, then the Secretary shall, not later than March 1 of the last of three consecutive marketing years for which marketing quotas are in effect for such kind of tobacco under this section, proclaim a national marketing quota for such kind of tobacco for the next three succeeding marketing years as provided in this section. The Secretary shall conduct extensive hearings in the area in which such kind of tobacco is produced to ascertain whether producers favor marketing quotas on an acreage basis or on a poundage basis and shall proclaim the quota on the basis he determines most producers of such kind of tobacco favor. Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum in accordance with section 1312(c) of this title. If more than one-half of the farmers voting in such referendum oppose the national marketing quotas, then the Secretary shall announce the results and no marketing quotas or price support shall be in effect for such kind of tobacco and the national marketing quota so proclaimed shall not be in effect for the next three succeeding marketing years. Thereafter the provisions of section 1312 of this title shall apply: <em>Provided</em>, That the national marketing quota and farm marketing quotas for such kind of tobacco shall be determined for such kind of tobacco as provided in this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:531 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of national marketing quota, determination; national reserve, establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the national marketing quota determined under this section for any kind of tobacco for which poundage quotas may be established for any marketing year shall be the amount of such kind of tobacco produced in the United States which the Secretary estimates will be utilized in the United States and will be exported during such marketing year, adjusted upward or downward in such amount as the Secretary, in his discretion, determines is desirable for the purpose of maintaining an adequate supply or for effecting an orderly reduction of supplies to the reserve supply level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For each marketing year for which marketing quotas are in effect for a kind of tobacco under this section, the Secretary in his discretion may establish a reserve with respect to such kind of tobacco (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;national reserve&rdquo;) from the national marketing quota for such kind of tobacco in an amount not in excess of 1 per centum of such national marketing quota to be available for making corrections and adjusting inequities in farm marketing quotas, and for establishing marketing quotas for new farms (that is, farms for which farm marketing quotas are not otherwise established).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For the 1986 and each subsequent crop of Burley tobacco, the national marketing quota for any marketing year shall be the quantity of Burley tobacco, as determined by the Secretary, that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the aggregate of the quantities of Burley tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettes estimate the manufacturers intend to purchase on the United States auction markets or from producers during the marketing year, as compiled and determined under section 1314g of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the average annual quantity of Burley tobacco exported from the United States during the 3 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the quantity, if any, of Burley tobacco that the Secretary, in the discretion of the Secretary, determines is necessary to increase or decrease the inventories of the producer-owned cooperative marketing associations that have entered into loan agreements with the Commodity Credit Corporation to make price support available to producers of Burley tobacco to establish or maintain such inventories, in the aggregate, at the reserve stock level for Burley tobacco.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (D), in determining the quantity of Burley tobacco necessary to establish or maintain the inventories of the producer associations at the reserve stock level under subparagraph (A)(iii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary shall provide for initially attaining the reserve stock level over a period of 5 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any downward adjustment in such inventories of Burley tobacco may not exceed the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) 35,000,000 pounds; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) 50 percent of the quantity by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(aa) the total inventories of Burley tobacco of the producer-owned cooperative marketing associations that have entered into loan agreements with the Commodity Credit Corporation to make price support available to producers of Burley tobacco; exceed</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(bb) the reserve stock level for Burley tobacco.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the national marketing quota for Burley tobacco for each of the 1986 through 1989 marketing years for such tobacco shall not be less than 94 percent of the national marketing quota for such tobacco for the preceding marketing year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the national marketing quota for Burley tobacco for each of the 1990 through 1996 marketing years for such tobacco shall not be less than 90 percent of the national marketing quota for such tobacco for the preceding marketing year, except that, in the case of each of the 1995 and 1996 crops of Burley tobacco, the Secretary may waive the requirements of this clause if the Secretary determines that the requirements would likely result in inventories of the producer-owned cooperative marketing associations for Burley tobacco described in section 1314h(a)(2) of this title to exceed 150 percent of the reserve stock level for Burley tobacco.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplicability of downward adjustment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines for any of the 2001 or subsequent crop years that noncommitted pool stocks of Burley tobacco are equal to or less than the reserve stock level established under this paragraph, subparagraph (B) shall not apply to the crop year for which the determination is made and all subsequent crop years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Farm yields; determination; limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a national marketing quota is first proclaimed for a kind of tobacco under this section, the Secretary shall through local committees determine a farm yield for each farm for which an acreage allotment for such kind of tobacco was established for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970, in the case of burley tobacco, and for the previous marketing year, in the case of dark air-cured tobacco and fire-cured tobacco. Such yield shall be determined by averaging the yield per acre for the four highest years of the five consecutive years beginning with the 1966 crop year, in the case of burley tobacco, and the immediately preceding 5 crop years, in the case of dark air-cured tobacco and fire-cured tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That if the kind of tobacco involved was produced on the farm in fewer than five of such years, the farm yield shall be the simple average of the yields obtained in the years during such period that such kind of tobacco was produced on the farm: <em>Provided further</em>, That if no such kind of tobacco was produced on the farm but the farm was considered as having planted such kind of tobacco during the immediately preceding five years, the <!-- PDFPage:532 -->farm yield will be appraised on the basis of the yields established for similar farms in the area on which such kind of tobacco was produced during such five-year period: <em>And provided further</em>, That the farm yield established for any farm shall not exceed three thousand five hundred pounds per acre, in the case of burley tobacco, and three thousand pounds per acre, in the case of dark air-cured tobacco and fire-cured tobacco: <em>And provided further</em>, That, when a marketing quota program for dark air-cured tobacco or for fire-cured tobacco is first established under this section, farm yields so determined with respect to dark air-cured tobacco or fire-cured tobacco, as the case may be, shall be adjusted proportionately so that the weighted average of such farm yields is equal to the national average yield goal for dark air-cured tobacco or fire-cured tobacco, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Farm marketing quotas; preliminary quotas, determination, limitation; succeeding years, quota computation, limitations, increase and reduction of quotas; new farms, limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A preliminary farm marketing quota shall be determined for each farm for which a burley tobacco acreage allotment was established for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970, by multiplying the farm yield determined under subsection (d) of this section by the farm acreage allotment (prior to any reduction for violation of regulations issued pursuant to the chapter) established for such farm for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970. A preliminary farm marketing quota shall be determined for each farm for which a dark air-cured tobacco or fire-cured tobacco acreage allotment was established for the previous marketing year, by multiplying the farm yield determined under such subsection by the farm acreage allotment (prior to any such reduction) established for such farm for the previous marketing year. For each farm for which such a preliminary farm marketing quota is determined, a farm marketing quota for the first year shall be determined by multiplying the preliminary farm marketing quota by a national factor obtained by dividing the national marketing quota determined under subsection (c) of this section (less the national reserve) by the sum of all preliminary farm marketing quotas as determined under this subsection: <em>Provided</em>, That such national factor shall not be less than 95 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The farm marketing quota for each succeeding year shall be determined by multiplying the previous year's farm marketing quota by a national factor obtained by dividing the national marketing quota determined under subsection (c) of this section (less the national reserve) by the sum of the farm marketing quotas for the immediately preceding year for all farms for which marketing quotas for the kind of tobacco involved will be determined for such succeeding marketing year: <em>Provided</em>, That, except in the case of Burley tobacco, such national factor shall not be less than 90 per centum: <em>Provided further</em>, That for the marketing years beginning October 1, 1972, and October 1, 1973, the farm marketing quota for any farm shall not be less than the smaller of (1) one-half acre times the farm yield times one-half the sum of the figure one and the national factor for the current year, or (2) the farm marketing quota for the immediately preceding marketing year times one-half the sum of the figure one and the national factor for the current year. The farm marketing quota so computed for any farm for any year shall be increased by the number of pounds by which marketings from the farm during the immediately preceding year were less than the farm marketing quota (after adjustments), except that (1) any such increase shall not exceed the amount of the farm marketing quota (including leased pounds) for the immediately preceding marketing year prior to any increase for undermarketings or decrease for overmarketings, and (2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1314e_1_target" name="1314e_1">1</a></sup> the aggregate of such increases for all farms for any crop year may not exceed 10 percent of the national basic quota for the preceding crop year, (2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1314e_1_target" name="1314e_1">1</a></sup> the total quantity of all adjustments under this sentence for all farms for any crop year may not exceed 10 percent of the national basic quota for the preceding crop year, and (3) this sentence shall not apply to the establishment of a marketing quota for the 2003 marketing year. The farm marketing quota so computed for each farm for any year shall be reduced by the number of pounds by which marketing from the farm during the immediately preceding year exceeded the farm marketing quota (after adjustments): <em>Provided</em>, That if, on account of excess marketings in the preceding year, the farm marketing quota is reduced to zero pounds without reflecting the entire reduction required, the additional reduction required shall be made in subsequent marketing years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The farm marketing quota for a new farm shall be the number of pounds determined by the county committee with approval of the State committee to be fair and reasonable for the farm on the basis of the past experience of the farm operator with respect to the kind of tobacco involved: the land, labor, and equipment available for the production of such kind of tobacco; crop rotation practices, and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of such kind of tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That the farm marketing quota for any such new farm shall not exceed 50 per centum of the average of the farm marketing quotas for similar farms for which farm marketing quotas are otherwise established: <em>Provided further</em>, That the number of pounds allocated to all new farms shall not exceed that portion of the national reserve provided by the Secretary for establishing quotas for new farms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reductions for false information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a poundage program is in effect for any kind of tobacco under this section, the farm marketing quota next established for any farm shall be reduced by the amount of such kind of tobacco produced on any farm (1) which is marketed as having been produced on a different farm; (2) for which proof of disposition is not furnished as required by the Secretary; and (3) as to which any producer on the farm files, or aids or acquiesces in the filing of, any false report with respect to the production or market<!-- PDFPage:533 -->ings of tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary through the local committee finds that no person connected with such farm caused, aided, or acquiesced in any such irregularity, the next established farm marketing quota shall not be reduced under this subsection. The reductions required under this subsection shall be in addition to any other adjustments made pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Leases and transfers of farm quotas; limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When a poundage program is in effect for any kind of tobacco under this section, farm marketing quotas (after adjustments) for such kind of tobacco may be leased and transferred to other farms in the same county under the terms and conditions contained in section 1314d of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That such leases and transfers shall be on a pound for pound basis: <em>Provided further</em>, That any adjustment for undermarketings or overmarketings shall be attributed to the farm to which leased and transferred: <em>Provided further</em>, That not more than thirty thousand pounds of Burley tobacco quota may be leased and transferred to any farm under this section: <em>Provided further</em>, That a lease and transfer of Burley tobacco quota shall not be effective for any crop year unless a record of the transfer is filed with the county committee not later than July 1 of that crop year or, if such record of the transfer is filed with the county committee after July 1, the county committee determines with the concurrence of the State committee that all interested parties agreed to such lease and transfer before July 1 and that the failure to file such record of the transfer did not result from gross negligence on the part of any party to such lease and transfer: <em>And provided further</em>, That the marketing quota determined for any farm subsequent to such lease and transfer shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the farm yield established under subsection (d) of this section by 50 per centum of the acreage of cropland in the farm.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Effective for the 1991 and subsequent crop years, the Secretary may, during any one year, and subject to such rules as the Secretary deems appropriate, permit the sale of a burley tobacco quota from one farm to another farm in the same county if the buyer, who is an active burley tobacco producer, is not buying an amount larger than 30 percent of the existing quota for the buyer's farm, or 20,000 pounds whichever is greater. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;active burley tobacco producer&rdquo; means any person who shared in the risk of producing a crop of burley tobacco in not less than one of the three years preceding the year involved, or any person who certified to the Secretary, in such form and manner as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe, their intent to become an active burley tobacco producer. A person shall be considered to have shared in the risk of producing a crop of burley tobacco if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the investment of such person in the production of such crop is not less than 20 percent of the proceeds of the sale of such crop;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the investment of such person's return on such investment is dependent solely on the sale price of such crop; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such person may not receive any of such return before the sale of such crop.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No sale of burley tobacco quota from a farm shall be permitted, under paragraph (2), if any sale of quota to the same farm has been made within the three immediately preceding crop years. A sale of burley tobacco quota shall not be effective for a crop year unless a record of the sale is filed with the county committee not later than July 1 of the crop year. The marketing quota determined for any farm subsequent to such sale shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the farm yield established under subsection (d) of this section by 50 percent of the acreage of cropland in the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Loss of quotas through underplanting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Effective with the marketing year beginning October 1, 1994, no marketing quota, other than a new farm marketing quota, shall be established for a farm on which no burley tobacco was planted or considered planted in any two of the three years immediately preceding the year for which farm marketing quotas are being established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Marketing penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When marketing quotas under this section are in effect, provisions with respect to penalties for the marketing of excess tobacco and the other provisions contained in section 1314 of this title shall apply, except that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No penalty on excess tobacco shall be due or collected until 103 per centum of the farm marketing quota (after adjustments) for a farm has been marketed, but with respect to each pound of tobacco marketed in excess of such percentage the full penalty rate shall be due, payable, and collected at the time of marketing on each pound of tobacco marketed, and any tobacco marketed in excess of 100 per centum of the farm marketing quota (after adjustments) will require a reduction in subsequent farm marketing quotas in accordance with subsection (e) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary, in his discretion, determines it is desirable to encourage additional marketings of any grades of the kind of tobacco involved during any marketing year to insure traditional market patterns to meet the normal demands of export and domestic markets, he may authorize the marketing of such grades without the payment of penalty or deduction from subsequent quotas to the extent of 5 per centum of the farm marketing quota for the farm on which the tobacco was produced, and such marketings shall be eligible for price support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions with respect to penalties contained in the third sentence of section 1314(a) of this title shall be revised to read: &ldquo;If any producer falsely identifies or fails to account for the disposition of any tobacco, the Secretary, in lieu of assessing and collecting penalties based on actual marketings of excess tobacco, may elect to assess a penalty computed by multiplying the full penalty rate by an amount of tobacco equal to 25 per centum of the farm marketing quota (after adjustments) and the penalty in respect thereof shall be paid and remitted by the producer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions contained in the fourth sentence of section 1314(a) of this title shall not be <!-- PDFPage:534 -->applicable. For the first year a marketing quota program established under the provisions of this section is in effect with respect to burley tobacco, the farm marketing quota determined under the provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall receive a temporary upward adjustment equal to the amount of carryover penalty-free burley tobacco for the farm. For subsequent years, the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he considers necessary for carrying out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Lease and transfer of burley tobacco quota assigned</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may permit, after July 1 of any crop year, the lease and transfer of burley tobacco quota assigned to a farm if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the planted acreage of burley tobacco on the farm to which the quota is assigned is determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to produce the effective farm marketing quota under average conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the farm's expected production of burley tobacco is less than 80 percent of the farm's effective marketing quota as a result of a natural disaster condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any lease and transfer of quota under this subsection may be made to any other farm within the same State in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The total quantity of quota leased or transferred to a farm during a crop year under this subsection may not exceed 15 percent of the quota on the farm that existed prior to any such lease or transfer for the crop year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Lease and transfer of Burley tobacco quota</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval by producers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may permit the lease and transfer of a Burley tobacco quota from one farm in a State to any other farm in the State if, in a State-wide referendum conducted by the Secretary, a majority of the active Burley tobacco producers voting in the referendum approve the use of that type of lease and transfer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply only to the States of Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Computerized recordkeeping system for Burley tobacco quota and acreage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Producer reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each person that owns a farm for which a Burley tobacco marketing quota is established under this chapter shall annually file with the Secretary a report describing the acreage planted to Burley tobacco on the farm.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computerized recordkeeping system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 180 days after June 20, 2000, the Secretary shall establish a computerized recordkeeping system that contains all information reported under paragraph (1) and related records, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Sale of Burley tobacco quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a person that owns a farm for which a Burley tobacco marketing quota is established under this chapter sells all or part of the acreage on the farm to a buyer, the Secretary shall permit the seller and buyer of the acreage to determine the percentage of the quota that is transferred with the acreage sold.</p>
