If the International Sugar Council fails to take corrective action to remedy the situation within a reasonable time after such request, the President shall submit to the Congress such recommendations as he may consider appropriate to correct the situation. In the event that members of the International Sugar Organization involved in market manipulation which has resulted in price increases have failed to remedy the situation within a reasonable time after a request for remedy, the exercise of the authority set forth in section 3602 of this title shall be suspended until the President determines that effective market manipulation activities have ceased.</p>
