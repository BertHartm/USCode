<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of title I of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.], acreage devoted to resource-conserving crops as part of a resource-conserving crop rotation under this program may also be designated as conservation use acreage for the purpose of fulfilling any provisions under any acreage limitation or land diversion program and up to 50 percent of the acreage so designated shall be without restrictions on haying and grazing, except as provided in paragraph (5)(B), except that such acreage that is devoted to perennial cover on which cost-share assistance for the establishment of the perennial cover has been provided, shall not be credited towards the producer's resource-conserving crop requirement under a contract under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Barley, oats, and wheat</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, barley, oats, or wheat planted as part of a resource-conserving crop on reduced acreage may not be harvested in kernel form.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payment acres</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Secretary shall not reduce farm program payments of participants in this program as a result of the planting a resource-conserving crop as part of a resource-conserving crop rotation on payment acres.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Haying and grazing restriction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall not make any program payments to a producer who is otherwise eligible to receive with respect to acreage enrolled in the program if such producer hays or grazes such acreage (excluding acreage designated as conservation use acreage) during the 5-month period in each State during which haying and grazing of conserving use acres is not allowed under the provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], or, if the crop planted on such acreage includes a small grain, before the producer harvests the small grain crop in kernel form.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation on permitted haying and grazing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Secretary determines that implementation of this section will result in a significant adverse economic impact on hay or livestock prices in a particular geographic area, the Secretary may limit the quantity of hay that can be harvested or grazed from that area. Such limit may include restrictions on the number of times that hay may be harvested or grazed from the acres per year, the timing of such harvesting and grazing, or the number of years that such land may remain in the same hay stand, or a prohibition on the harvesting or grazing of hay from acres on which a small grain was not originally interplanted with the hay crop and harvested for grain.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Base acre adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, only for the purpose of establishing a producer's crop acreage base under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], may make such adjustments as the Secretary determines to be fair and equitable to reflect resource-conserving crop rotation practices that were maintained by producers prior to participation in the program and to reflect such other factors as the Secretary determines should be considered, except that the total of such adjustments in any year shall not exceed the total farm program savings in the same year that would result from the implementation of plans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Payment acreage limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No producers enrolled in a resource-conserving crop rotation shall be eligible to receive payments under farm programs for wheat, feed grains, cotton, or rice under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.] on acreage equal to the average number of traditionally underplanted acres for the three years prior to enrolling in this program.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Traditionally underplanted acreage&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), for the purposes of this paragraph the term &ldquo;traditionally underplanted acreage&rdquo; means the difference in a particular year between the acreage that is part of a producer's crop acreage base that is not planted to the program crop and the part of the crop acreage base subject to an acreage limitation program or required to be set aside, but only to the extent that such number exceeds the number of acres resulting from the reduction in payment acres under an amend<!-- PDFPage:1362 -->ment made by section 1101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&ndash;508; 104 Stat. 1388&ndash;1). In no case shall such acreage be less than zero.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a producer participating in a particular year in a program authorized under section 101B(c)(1)(D), 103B(c)(1)(D), 105B(c)(1)(E), or 107B(c)(1)(E)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5822_1_target" name="5822_1">1</a></sup> of the Agricultural Act of 1949, the term &ldquo;traditionally underplanted acreage&rdquo; means 8 percent of the producer's permitted acreage for such year.</p>
