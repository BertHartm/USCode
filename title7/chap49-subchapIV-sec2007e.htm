The Board may further order such entity to take such action or to refrain from such action as the Board determines necessary to ensure compliance with sections 2007a to 2007e of this title and the regulations issued thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Order to show cause, contents, and hearing</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Prior to revoking or suspending a line of credit under paragraph (1) or (2), or issuing a cease and desist order under paragraph (3), the Board shall serve on the eligible entity an order to show cause why an order revoking or suspending the line of credit or a cease and desist order should not be issued.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, after a hearing under subparagraph (B) or a waiver thereof, the Board determines on the record that an order revoking or suspending the line of credit, or a cease and desist order should be issued, or an order requiring a refund of the Federal investment in addition to reasonable interest thereon should issue, the Board shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administration and the reasons for such findings and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the entity.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Fees and mileage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Witnesses summoned before the Board shall be paid by the party at whose instance such witnesses were called the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of disobedience to a subpoena under this paragraph, the Board, or any party to a proceeding before the Board, may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An order issued by the Board under this subsection shall be final and conclusive unless not later than 30 days after the service thereof the eligible entity appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such corporation has its principal place of business by filing with the clerk of such court a petition praying that the order of the Board be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Filing</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Leave of court</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The clerk of the court shall, on filing, cause a copy of the petition to be delivered to the Board and the Board shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the record on which the order was entered.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Stay or suspension of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The filing of a petition for review under this paragraph shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the Board, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Board may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason <!-- PDFPage:1025 -->of the additional evidence taken under this subparagraph, and it shall file its modified or new findings and the amendments, if any, of its order, with the records of such additional evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Consideration of objections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The court shall not consider an objection to an order of the Board unless the objection was argued before the Board or, if it were not so argued, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Enforcement of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the entity against which or against whom an order is issued under this subsection fails to obey the order, the Board may apply to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit where the entity has its principal place of business, for the enforcement of the order, and shall file a transcript of the record on which the order complained of was entered. On the filing of the application, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served on the entity. The evidence to be considered, the procedure to be followed, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be the same as is provided in paragraph (6) for applications to set aside or modify orders.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Subpoena</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of any investigation under this subsection, the Board may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents that are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Refusal to obey</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to, any individual, including an entity or corporation, the Board may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such individual resides or carries on business activity, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents, and such court may issue an order requiring such individual to appear before the Board, to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Contempt</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A failure to obey an order of the court under this subsection shall be punishable by such court as a contempt thereof.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such entities shall prepare and submit reports to the Board at such times and in such form as the Board may require.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Examinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each eligible entity shall be examined and audited at least once every 2 years, under procedures established by the Board, to determine whether or not such entity has been operated in a manner consistent with sections 2007a to 2007e of this title and in an otherwise lawful manner, except that the Board may defer the examination for not more than 1 year if, in its discretion, the Board determines that such a deferral would be appropriate based on the prior operating experience of the entity, the contents and results of the last examination of the entity, and the management expertise of the entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Injunctions or other orders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grounds and jurisdiction of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the judgment of the Board, an eligible entity has engaged or is about to engage in conduct that constitutes or will constitute a violation of any provision of sections 2007a to 2007e of this title, of any regulation under sections 2007a to 2007e of this title, or of any order issued under this section, the Board may apply to the proper district court of the United States or a United States court located in any jurisdiction subject to the laws of the United States, for an order enjoining such conduct or enforcing compliance with such provision, rule, regulation, or order. Such court shall have jurisdiction over such conduct and, <!-- PDFPage:1026 -->on a showing by the Board that such entity has engaged in or is about to engage in such conduct, may issue a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order without bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Equity jurisdiction of corporation and assets</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Trusteeship or receivership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall have authority to act as trustee or receiver of an entity under this section.
