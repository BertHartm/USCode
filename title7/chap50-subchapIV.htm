<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as the Congress may from time to time determine to be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this chapter and for the administration of assets transferred to the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sale by lender and any holder of guaranteed portion of loan pursuant to regulations governing such sales; limitations; issuance of pool certificates representing ownership of guaranteed portion of guaranteed loan; terms and conditions, etc.; reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The guaranteed portion of any loan made under this chapter may be sold by the lender, and by any subsequent holder, in accordance with regulations governing such sales as the Secretary shall establish, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) All fees due the Secretary with respect to a guaranteed loan are to be paid in full before any sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The loan is to have been fully disbursed to the borrower before the sale.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After a loan is sold in the secondary market, the lender shall remain obligated under its guarantee agreement with the Secretary, and shall continue to service the loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for determining the increase of farmers&rsquo; access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This subsection shall not be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made under this chapter, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may, directly or through a market maker approved by the Secretary, issue pool certificates representing ownership of part or all of the guaranteed portion of any loan guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter. Such certificates shall be based on and backed by a pool established or approved by the Secretary and composed solely of the entire guaranteed portion of such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, guarantee the timely payment of the principal and interest on pool certificates issued on behalf of the Secretary by approved market makers for purposes of this subsection. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans that compose the pool. If a loan in such pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or by reason of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the pool certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Secretary only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the pool certificate, the certificate may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts that may be required to be paid under any guarantee of such pool certificates issued by approved market makers under this subsection. The Secretary may expend amounts in the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund to make payments on such guarantees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) Within 30 days after a borrower of a guaranteed loan is in default of any principal or interest payment due for 60 days or more, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) purchase the pool certificates representing ownership of the guaranteed portion of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) pay the registered holder of the certificates an amount equal to the guaranteed portion of the loan represented by the certificate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) If the Secretary pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, the claim shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment, as may be provided by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Secretary of the Secretary's ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the pool against which the certificates are issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the adoption of final rules and regulations, the Secretary shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Provide for the central collection of registration information from all participating market makers for all loans and pool certificates sold under paragraphs (1) and (2). Such information shall include, with respect to each original sale and any subsequent sale, identification of the interest rate paid by the borrower to the lender, the lender's servicing fee, whether interest on the loan is at a fixed or variable rate, identification of each purchaser of a pool certificate, the interest rate paid on the certificate, and such other information as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before any sale, require the seller to disclose to each prospective purchaser of the portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to each prospective purchaser of a pool certificate issued under paragraph (2), information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this subparagraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term &ldquo;seller&rdquo; does not include (i) the person who made the loan or (ii) any person who sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Provide for adequate custody of any pooled guaranteed loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Take such actions as are necessary, in restructuring pools of the guaranteed portion <!-- PDFPage:939 -->of loans, to minimize the estimated costs of paying claims under guarantees issued under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Require each market maker&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to service all pools formed, and participations sold, by the market maker; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to provide the Secretary with information relating to the collection and disbursement of all periodic payments, prepayments, and default funds from lenders, to or from the reserve fund that the Secretary shall establish to enable the timely payment guarantee to be self-funding, and from all beneficial holders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Regulate market makers in pool certificates sold under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may contract for goods and services to be used for the purposes of this subsection without regard to the provisions of titles 5, 40, and 41, and any regulations issued thereunder.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall modify delinquent farmer program loans made or insured under this chapter, or purchased from the lender or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 1929b of this title, to the maximum extent possible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to avoid losses to the Secretary on such loans, with priority consideration being placed on writing-down the loan principal and interest (subject to subsections (d) and (e) of this section), and debt set-aside (subject to subsection (e) of this section), whenever these procedures would facilitate keeping the borrower on the farm or ranch, or otherwise through the use of primary loan service programs as provided in this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure that borrowers are able to continue farming or ranching operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to obtain assistance under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the delinquency must be due to circumstances beyond the control of the borrower, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary, except that the regulations shall require that, if the value of the assets calculated under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section that may be realized through liquidation or other methods would produce enough income to make the delinquent loan current, the borrower shall not be eligible for assistance under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower must have acted in good faith with the Secretary in connection with the loan as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the borrower must present a preliminary plan to the Secretary that contains reasonable assumptions that demonstrate that the borrower will be able to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) meet the necessary family living and farm operating expenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) service all debts, including those of the loans restructured; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the loan, if restructured, must result in a net recovery to the Federal Government, during the term of the loan as restructured, that would be more than or equal to the net recovery to the Federal Government from an invol<!-- PDFPage:953 -->untary liquidation or foreclosure on the property securing the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restructuring determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of net recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the net recovery from the involuntary liquidation of a loan under this section, the Secretary shall calculate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan, in accordance with paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of the restructured loan, in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recovery value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of paragraph (1), the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the amount of the current appraised value of the interests of the borrower in the property securing the loan; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the value of the interests of the borrower in all other assets that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) not essential for necessary family living expenses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) not essential to the operation of the farm; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) not exempt from judgment creditors or in a bankruptcy action under Federal or State law; less</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the estimated administrative, legal, and other expenses associated with the liquidation and disposition of the loan and collateral, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the payment of prior liens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) taxes and assessments, depreciation, management costs, the yearly percentage decrease or increase in the value of the property, and lost interest income, each calculated for the average holding period for the type of property involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) resale expenses, such as repairs, commissions, and advertising; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) other administrative and attorney's costs; plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the value, as determined by the Secretary, of any property not included in subparagraph (A)(i) if the property is specified in any security agreement with respect to such loan and the Secretary determines that the value of such property should be included for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Value of the restructured loan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of paragraph (1), the value of the restructured loan shall be based on the present value of payments that the borrower would make to the Federal Government if the terms of such loan were modified under any combination of primary loan service programs to ensure that the borrower is able to meet such obligations and continue farming operations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Present value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of calculating the present value referred to in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall use a discount rate of not more than the current rate on 90-day Treasury bills.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Cash flow margin</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of assessing under subparagraph (A) the ability of a borrower to meet debt obligations and continue farming operations, the Secretary shall assume that the borrower needs up to 100 percent of the amount indicated for payment of farm operating expenses, debt service obligations, and family living expenses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 90 days after receipt of a written request for restructuring from the borrower, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make the calculations specified in paragraphs (2) and (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notify the borrower in writing of the results of such calculations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide documentation for the calculations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Restructuring of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the value of the restructured loan is greater than or equal to the recovery value, the Secretary shall, within 45 days after notifying the borrower of such calculations, offer to restructure the loan obligations of the borrower under this chapter through primary loan service programs that would enable the borrower to meet the obligations (as modified) under the loan and to continue the farming operations of the borrower. If the borrower accepts such offer, within 45 days after receipt of notice of acceptance, the Secretary shall restructure the loan accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Termination of loan obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The obligations of a borrower to the Secretary under a loan shall terminate if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the borrower satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of the restructured loan is less than the recovery value; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not later than 90 days after receipt of the notification described in paragraph (4)(B), the borrower pays (or obtains third-party financing to pay) the Secretary an amount equal to the current market value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Negotiation of appraisal</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a determination concerning restructuring under this subsection, the Secretary, at the request of the borrower, shall enter into negotiations concerning appraisals required under this subsection with the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Independent appraisal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the borrower, based on a separate current appraisal, objects to the decision of the Secretary regarding an appraisal, the borrower and the Secretary shall mutually agree, to the extent practicable, on an independent appraiser who shall conduct another appraisal of the borrower's property. The average of the two appraisals that are closest in value shall become the final appraisal under this paragraph. The borrower and the Secretary shall each pay one-half of the cost of the independent appraisal.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:954 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Principal and interest write-down</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Priority consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In selecting the restructuring alternatives to be used in the case of a borrower who has requested restructuring under this section, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to the use of principal and interest write-down, except that this procedure shall not be given first priority in the case of a borrower unless other creditors of such borrower (other than those creditors who are fully collateralized) representing a substantial portion of the total debt of the borrower held by such creditors, agree to participate in the development of the restructuring plan or agree to participate in a State mediation program.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure of creditors to agree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Failure of creditors to agree to participate in the restructuring plan or mediation program shall not preclude the use of principal and interest write-down by the Secretary if the Secretary determines that this restructuring alternative results in the least cost to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Participation of creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before eliminating the option to use debt write-down in the case of a borrower, the Secretary shall make a reasonable effort to contact the creditors of such borrower, either directly or through the borrower, and encourage such creditors to participate with the Secretary in the development of a restructuring plan for the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Shared appreciation arrangements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As a condition of restructuring a loan in accordance with this section, the borrower of the loan may be required to enter into a shared appreciation arrangement that requires the repayment of amounts written off or set aside.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Shared appreciation agreements shall have a term not to exceed 10 years, and shall provide for recapture based on the difference between the appraised values of the real security property at the time of restructuring and at the time of recapture.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Percentage of recapture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the appreciation to be recaptured by the Secretary shall be 75 percent of the appreciation in the value of such real security property if the recapture occurs within 4 years of the restructuring, and 50 percent if the recapture occurs during the remainder of the term of the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Time of recapture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Recapture shall take place at the end of the term of the agreement, or sooner&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the repayment of the loans; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the borrower ceases farming operations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Transfer of title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Transfer of title to the spouse of a borrower on the death of such borrower shall not be treated as a conveyance for the purpose of paragraph (4).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning with fiscal year 2000 not later than 12 months before the end of the term of a shared appreciation arrangement, the Secretary shall notify the borrower involved of the provisions of the arrangement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Determination to restructure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the appeal process results in a determination that a loan is eligible for restructuring, the Secretary shall restructure the loan in the manner consistent with this section, taking into consideration the restructuring recommendations, if any, of the appeals officer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prerequisites to foreclosure or liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No foreclosure or other similar actions shall be taken to liquidate any loan determined to be ineligible for restructuring by the Secretary under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) until the borrower has been given the opportunity to appeal such decision; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the borrower appeals, the appeals process has been completed, and a determination has been made that the loan is ineligible for restructuring.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Time limits for restructuring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Once an appeal has been filed under section 1983b&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2001_1_target" name="2001_1">1</a></sup> of this title, a decision shall be made at each level in the appeals process within 45 days after the receipt of the appeal or request for further review.</p>

On such request, the appeals division shall present the borrower with a list of three appraisers approved by the county supervisor, from which the borrower shall select an appraiser to conduct the appraisal, the cost of which shall be borne by the borrower. The results of such appraisal shall be considered in any final determination concerning the loan. A copy of any appraisal made <!-- PDFPage:955 -->under this paragraph shall be provided to the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Partial liquidations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If partial liquidations are performed (with the prior consent of the Secretary) as part of loan servicing by a guaranteed lender under this chapter, the Secretary shall not require full liquidation of a delinquent loan in order for the lender to be eligible to receive payment on losses.</p>
