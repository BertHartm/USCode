<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary of Agriculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture, either independently or in cooperation with States or political subdivisions thereof, farmers&rsquo; associations and similar organizations, and individuals, is authorized to carry out operations or measures to detect, eradicate, suppress, control, or to prevent or retard the spread of plant pests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Intergovernmental cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture is further authorized to cooperate with the governments of foreign countries, or the local authorities thereof, and with foreign or international organizations or associations, in carrying out necessary surveys and control operations in those countries in connection with the detection, eradication, suppression, control, and prevention or retardation of the spread of plant pests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cooperating foreign agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In performing the operations or measures herein authorized, the cooperating foreign country, State, or local agency shall be responsible for the authority necessary to carry out the operations or measures on all lands and properties within the foreign country or State other than those owned or controlled by the Federal Government and for such other facilities and means as in the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture are necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;plant pest&rdquo; means any living stage of any insects, mites, nematodes, slugs, snails, protozoa, or other invertebrate animals, bacteria, fungi, other parasitic plants or reproductive parts thereof, viruses, or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing, or any infectious substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;living stage&rdquo; includes the egg, pupal, and larval stages as well as any other living stage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes the District of Columbia and the territories and possessions of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization of appropriations; fees, late payment penalties, and accrued interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Unless otherwise specifically authorized or provided for in appropriations Acts, no part of such sums shall be used to pay the cost or value of property injured or destroyed.</p>

Any person for whom such an activity is performed shall be liable for payment of fees assessed. Upon failure to pay such fees when due, the Secretary of Agriculture shall assess a late payment penalty, and such overdue fees shall accrue interest, as required by section 3717 of title 31. All fees, late payment penalties, and accrued interest collected shall be credited to such accounts that incur the costs and shall remain available until expended without fiscal year limitation.

In the case of any person who fails to make payment when due, the Secretary of Agriculture shall also have a lien against any plant or plant product thereafter attempted to be exported by such person. The Secretary of Agriculture may, in case of nonpayment of the fees, late payment penalty, or accrued interest, after giving reasonable notice of default to the person liable for payment of such assessments, sell at public sale after reasonable public notice, or otherwise dispose of, any such plant or plant product upon which the Secretary of Agriculture has a lien pursuant to this section.

The Secretary of Agriculture shall, pursuant to regulations as prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, suspend performance of services to persons who have failed to pay such fees, late payment penalty and accrued interest.</p>
