<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) The &ldquo;parity price&rdquo; for any agricultural commodity, as of any date, shall be determined by multiplying the adjusted base price of such commodity as of such date by the parity index as of such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The &ldquo;adjusted base price&rdquo; of any agricultural commodity, as of any date, shall be (i) the average of the prices received by farmers for such commodity, at such times as the Secretary may select during each year of the ten-year period ending on the 31st of December last before such date, or during each marketing season beginning in such period if the Secretary determines use of a calendar year basis to be impracticable, divided by (ii) the ratio of the general level of prices received by farmers for agricultural commodities during such period to the general level of prices received by farmers for agricultural commodities during the period January 1910 to December 1914, inclusive. As used in this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;prices&rdquo; shall include wartime subsidy payments made to producers under programs designed to maintain maximum prices established under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The &ldquo;parity index&rdquo;, as of any date, shall be the ratio of (i) the general level of prices for articles and services that farmers buy, wages paid hired farm labor, interest on farm indebtedness secured by farm real estate, and taxes on farm real estate, for the calendar month ending last before such date to (ii) the general level of such prices, wages, rates, and taxes during the period January 1910 to December 1914, inclusive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The prices and indices provided for herein, and the data used in computing them, shall be determined by the Secretary, whose determination shall be final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the transitional parity price for any agricultural commodity, computed as provided in this subparagraph, shall be used as the parity price for such commodity until such date after January 1, 1950, as such transitional parity price may be lower than the parity price, computed as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, for such commodity. The transitional parity price for any agricultural commodity as of any date shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) its parity price determined in the manner used prior to the effective date of the Agricultural Act of 1948, less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 5 per centum of the parity price so determined multiplied by the number of full calendar years (not counting 1956 in the case of basic agricultural commodities) which, as of such date, have elapsed after January 1, 1949, in the case of non-basic agricultural commodities, and after January 1, 1955, in the case of the basic agricultural commodities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (E) of this paragraph, if the parity price for any agricultural commodity, computed as provided in subparagraphs (A) and (E) of this paragraph, appears to be seriously out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities, the Secretary may, and upon the request of a substantial number of interested producers shall, hold public hearings to determine the proper relationship between the parity price of such commodity and the parity prices of other agricultural commodities. Within sixty days after commencing such hearing the Secretary shall complete such hearing, proclaim his findings as to whether the facts require a revision of the method of computing the parity price of such commodity, and put into effect any revision so found to be required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the parity price for any basic agricultural commodity, as of any date during the six-year period beginning January 1, 1950, shall not be less than its parity price computed in the manner used prior to October 31, 1949.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;Parity&rdquo;, as applied to income, shall be that gross income from agriculture which will provide the farm operator and his family with a standard of living equivalent to those afforded persons dependent upon other gainful occupation. &ldquo;Parity&rdquo; as applied to income from any agricultural commodity for any year, shall be that gross income which bears the same relationship to parity income from agriculture for such year as the average gross income from such commodity for the preceding ten calendar years bears to the average gross income from agriculture for such ten calendar years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of preventing the use of multiple legal entities to avoid the effective application of the payment limitations under section 1308 of this title:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person (as defined in section 1308(e)(2)(A) of this title) that receives farm program payments (as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section as being subject to limitation) for a crop year may not also hold, directly or indirectly, substantial beneficial interests in more than two entities (as defined in section 1308(e)(2)(A)(ii) of this title) engaged in farm operations that also receive such payments as separate persons, for the purposes of the application of the limitations under section 1308 of this title. A person that does not receive such payments for a crop year may not hold, directly or indirectly, substantial beneficial interests in more than three entities that receive such payments as separate persons, for the purposes of the application of the limitations under section 1308 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimal beneficial interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of this subsection, a beneficial interest in any entity that is less than 10 percent of all beneficial interests in such entity combined shall not be considered a substantial beneficial interest, unless the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a smaller percentage should apply to one or more beneficial interests to ensure that the purpose of this subsection is achieved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notification by entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To facilitate administration of this subsection, each entity receiving such payments as a separate person shall notify each individual or other entity that acquires or holds a <!-- PDFPage:503 -->substantial beneficial interest in it of the requirements and limitations under this subsection. Each such entity receiving payments shall provide to the Secretary of Agriculture, at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the Secretary, the name and social security number of each individual, or the name and taxpayer identification number of each entity, that holds or acquires a substantial beneficial interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notification of interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a person is notified that the person holds substantial beneficial interests in more than the number of entities receiving payments that is permitted under this subsection for the purposes of the application of the limitations under section 1308 of this title, the person immediately shall notify the Secretary, designating those entities that should be considered as permitted entities for the person for purposes of applying the limitations. Each remaining entity in which the person holds a substantial beneficial interest shall be subject to reductions in the payments to the entity subject to limitation under section 1308 of this title in accordance with this subparagraph. Each such payment applicable to the entity shall be reduced by an amount that bears the same relation to the full payment that the person's beneficial interest in the entity bears to all beneficial interests in the entity combined. Before making such reductions, the Secretary shall notify all individuals or entities affected thereby and permit them to adjust among themselves their interests in the designated entity or entities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice not provided</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the person does not so notify the Secretary, all entities in which the person holds substantial beneficial interests shall be subject to reductions in the per person limitations under section 1308 of this title in the manner described in subparagraph (A).

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever the Secretary of Agriculture determines that an action authorized under subsection (c), (d), or (e) of this section will reduce the total of the direct and indirect costs to the Federal Government of a commodity program administered by the Secretary without adversely affecting income to small- and medium-sized producers participating in such program, the Secretary shall take such action with respect to the commodity program involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reservation of Secretary's right to reopen or change contracts if producer agrees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the announcement of the specific provisions of any commodity program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary shall include a statement setting forth which, if any, of the actions are to be initially included in the program, and a statement that the Secretary reserves the right to initiate at a later date any action not previously included but authorized by this section, including the right to reopen and change a contract entered into by a producer under the program if the producer voluntarily agrees to the change.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">When a nonrecourse loan program is in effect for a crop of a commodity, the Secretary may enter the commercial market to purchase such commodity if the Secretary determines that the cost of such purchases plus appropriate carrying charges will probably be less than the comparable cost of later acquiring the commodity through defaults on nonrecourse loans under the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction in settlement price of nonrecourse loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the domestic market price of a commodity for which a nonrecourse loan program (including the program authorized by section 1445e of this title) is in effect is insufficient to cover the principal and accumulated interest on a loan made under such program, thereby encouraging default by a producer, the Secretary may provide for settlement of such loan and redemption by the producer of the commodity securing such loan for less than the total of the principal and all interest accumulated thereon if the Secretary determines that such reduction in the settlement price will yield benefits to the Federal Government due to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) receipt by the Federal Government of a portion rather than none of the accumulated interest;</p>
