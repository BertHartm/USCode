<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Source</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide the price support authorized or required herein through the Commodity Credit Corporation and other means available to him.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of Secretary; factors considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the amounts, terms, and conditions of price support operations and the extent to which such operations are carried out, shall be determined or approved by the Secretary. The following factors shall be taken into consideration in determining, in the case of any commodity for which price support is discretionary, whether a price-support operation shall be undertaken and the level of such support and, in the case of any commodity for which price support is mandatory, the level of support in excess of the minimum level prescribed for such commodity: (1) the supply of the commodity in relation to the demand therefor, (2) the price levels at which other commodities are being supported and, in the case of feed grains, the feed values of such grains in relation to corn, (3) the availability of funds, (4) the perishability of the commodity, (5) the importance of the commodity to agriculture and the national economy, (6) the ability to dispose of stocks acquired through a price-support operation, (7) the need for offsetting temporary losses of export markets, (8) the ability and willingness of producers to keep supplies in line with demand and (9), in the case of upland cotton, changes in the cost of producing such cotton.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compliance by producer; program for diverted acres</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Compliance by the producer with acreage allotments, production goals and marketing practices (including marketing quotas when authorized by law), prescribed by the Secretary, may be required as a condition of eligibility for price support. In administering any program for diverted acres the Secretary may make his regulations applicable on an appropriate geographical basis. Such regulations shall be administered (1) in semiarid or other areas where good husbandry requires maintenance of a prudent feed reserve in such manner as to permit, to the extent so required by good husbandry, the production of forage crops for storage and subsequent use either on the farm or in feeding operations of the farm operator, and (2) in areas declared to be disaster areas by the President under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.], in such manner as will most quickly restore the normal pattern of their agriculture.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time of determining levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The level of price support for any commodity shall be determined upon the basis of its parity price as of the beginning of the marketing year or season in the case of any commodity marketed on a marketing year or season basis and as of January 1 in the case of any other commodity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Processors&rsquo; assurances; payment if assurances inadequate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever any price support or surplus removal operation for any agricultural commodity is carried out through purchases from or loans or payments to processors, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, obtain from the processors such assurances as he deems adequate that the producers of the agricultural commodity involved have received or will receive maximum benefits from the price support or surplus removal operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the assurances under paragraph (1) are not adequate to cause the producers of sugar beets and sugarcane, because of the bankruptcy or other insolvency of the processor, to receive maximum benefits from the price support program within 30 days after the final settlement date provided for in the contract between such producers and processor, the Secretary, on demand made by such producers and on such assurances as to nonpayment as the Secretary shall require, shall pay such producers such maximum benefits less benefits previously received by such producers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) On such payment, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) be subrogated to all claims of such producers against the processor and other persons responsible for nonpayment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) have authority to pursue such claims as necessary to recover the benefits not paid to the producers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall carry out this paragraph through the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this Act&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A commodity shall be considered storable upon determination by the Secretary that, in normal trade practice, it is stored for substantial periods of time and that it can be stored under the price-support program without excessive loss through deterioration or spoilage or without excessive cost for storage for such periods as will permit its disposition without substantial impairment of the effectiveness of the price-support program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A &ldquo;cooperator&rdquo; with respect to any basic agricultural commodity shall be a producer on whose farm the acreage planted to the commodity does not exceed the farm acreage allotment for the commodity under subchapter II of chapter 35 of this title, or in the case of price support for corn or wheat to a producer outside the commercial corn-producing or wheat-producing area, a producer who complies with conditions of eligibility prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That for upland cotton a cooperator shall be a producer on whose farm the acreage planted to such cotton does not exceed the cooperator percentage, which shall be in the case of the 1966 crop, 87.5 per centum of such farm acreage allotment and, in the case of each of the 1967 through 1970 crops, such percentage, not less than 87.5 or more than 100 per centum, of such farm acreage allotment as the Secretary may specify for such crop, except that in the case of small farms (i.e. farms on which the acreage allotment is 10 acres or less, or on which the projected farm yield times the acreage allotment is 3,600 pounds or less, and the acreage allotment has not been reduced under section 1344(m) of this title) the acreage of cotton on the farm shall not be required to be reduced below the farm acreage allotment: <em>And provided</em>, That for the 1971 through 1977 crops of upland cotton a cooperator shall be a producer on a farm on which a farm base acreage allotment has been established who has set aside the acreage required under section 1444(e) of this title: <em>Provided further</em>, That for the 1976 through 1981 crops of rice, a cooperator shall be a person who produces rice on a farm for which a farm acreage allotment has been established or to which a producer acreage allotment has been allocated and, if a set-aside is in effect, who has set aside any acreage required under section 1441(g) of this title: <em>Provided further</em>, That for the 1978 through 1981 crops of upland cotton, a cooperator shall be a producer on a farm who has set aside the acreage required under section 1444(f) of this title. For the purpose of this subsection, a producer shall not be deemed to have exceeded his farm acreage allotment unless such producer knowingly exceeded such allotment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A &ldquo;basic agricultural commodity&rdquo; shall mean corn, cotton, rice, and wheat, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A &ldquo;nonbasic agricultural commodity&rdquo; shall mean any agricultural commodity other than a basic agricultural commodity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The &ldquo;supply percentage&rdquo; as to any commodity shall be the percentage which the estimated total supply is of the normal supply as determined by the Secretary from the latest available statistics of the Department of Agriculture as of the beginning of the marketing year for the commodity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) &ldquo;Total supply&rdquo; of any nonbasic agricultural commodity for any marketing year shall be the carry-over at the beginning of such marketing year, plus the estimated production of the commodity in the United States during the calendar year in which such marketing year be<!-- PDFPage:629 -->gins and the estimated imports of the commodity into the United States during such marketing year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) &ldquo;Carry-over&rdquo; of any nonbasic agricultural commodity for any marketing year shall be the quantity of the commodity on hand in the United States at the beginning of such marketing year, not including any part of the crop or production of such commodity which was produced in the United States during the calendar year then current. The carryover of any such commodity may also include the quantity of such commodity in processed form on hand in the United States at the beginning of such marketing year, if the Secretary determines that the inclusion of such processed quantity of the commodity is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) &ldquo;Normal supply&rdquo; of any nonbasic agricultural commodity for any marketing year shall be (1) the estimated domestic consumption of the commodity for the marketing year for which such normal supply is being determined, plus (2) the estimated exports of the commodity for such marketing year, plus (3) an allowance for carry-over. The allowance for carry-over shall be the average carry-over of the commodity for the five marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year in which such normal supply is determined, adjusted for surpluses or deficiencies caused by abnormal conditions, changes in marketing conditions, or the operation of any agricultural program. In determining normal supply, the Secretary shall make such adjustments for current trends in consumption and for unusual conditions as he may deem necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) &ldquo;Marketing year&rdquo; for any nonbasic agricultural commodity means any period determined by the Secretary during which substantially all of a crop or production of such commodity is normally marketed by the producers thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Any term defined in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 [7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.], shall have the same meaning when used in this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Reference made in sections 1422, 1423, 1426, 1427, and 1431 of this title to the terms &ldquo;support price&rdquo;, &ldquo;level of support&rdquo;, and &ldquo;level of price support&rdquo; shall be considered to apply as well to the loan and purchase level for wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, extra long staple cotton, honey, oilseeds and rice under this Act.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligible recipients; barter; estimates; reprocessing and other charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to prevent the waste of commodities whether in private stocks or acquired through price-support operations by the Commodity Credit Corporation before they can be disposed of in normal domestic channels without impairment of the price-support program or sold abroad at competitive world prices, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized, on such terms and under such regulations as the Secretary of Agriculture may deem in the public interest: (1) upon application, to make such commodities available to any Federal agency for use in making payment for commodities not produced in the United States; (2) to barter or exchange such commodities for strategic or other materials as authorized by law; (3) in the case of food commodities to donate such commodities to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and to such State, Federal, or private agency or agencies as may be designated by the proper State or Federal authority and approved by the Secretary, for use in the United States in nonprofit school-lunch programs, in nonprofit summer camps for children, in the assistance of needy persons, and in charitable institutions, including hospitals and facilities, to the extent that they serve needy persons (including infants and children). In the case of clause (3) the Secretary shall obtain such assurance as he deems necessary that the recipients thereof will not diminish their normal expenditures for food by reason of such donation. In order to facilitate the appropriate disposal of such commodities, the Secretary may from time to time estimate and announce the quantity of such commodities which he anticipates will become available for distribution under clause (3). The Commodity Credit Corporation may pay, with respect to commodities disposed of under this subsection, reprocessing, packaging, transporting, handling, and other charges accruing up to the time of their delivery to a Federal agency, or to the designated State or private agency. In addition, in the case of food commodities disposed of under this subsection, the Commodity Credit Corporation may pay the cost of processing such commodities into a form suitable for home or institutional use, such processing to be accomplished through private trade facilities to the greatest extent possible. For the purpose of this subsection the terms &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;United States&rdquo; include the District of Columbia and any Territory or possession of the United States. Dairy products acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation through price support operations may, insofar as they can be used in the United States in nonprofit school lunch and other nonprofit child feeding programs, in the assistance of needy persons, and in charitable institutions, including hospitals, to the extent that needy persons are served, be donated for any such use prior to any other use or disposition. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such dairy products may be donated for distribution to needy households in the United States and to meet the needs of persons receiving nutrition assistance under the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Furnishing of eligible commodities for carrying out programs of assistance in developing and friendly countries; availability of eligible commodities for nonprofit and voluntary agencies and cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, subject to the requirements of paragraph (10), may furnish eligible commodities for carrying out programs of assistance in developing countries and friendly countries under titles II and III of the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq., 1727 et seq.] and under the Food for Progress Act of 1985 [7 U.S.C. 1736<em>o</em>], as approved by the Secretary, and for such purposes as are approved by the Secretary. To ensure that the furnishing of commodities under this subsection is coordinated with and complements other United States foreign assistance, assistance under this subsection shall be coordinated through the mechanism designated by the President to coordinate assistance under the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;eligible commodities&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) dairy products, wheat, rice, feed grains, and oilseeds acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation through price support operations, and the products thereof, that the Secretary determines meet the criteria specified in subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other edible agricultural commodities as may be acquired by the Secretary or the Commodity Credit Corporation in the normal course of operations and that are available for disposition under this subsection, except that no such commodities may be acquired for the purpose of their use under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Commodities may not be made available for disposition under this subsection in amounts that (i) will, in any way, reduce the amounts of commodities that traditionally are made available through donations to domestic feeding programs or agencies, or (ii) will prevent the Secretary from fulfilling any agreement entered into by the Secretary under a payment-in-kind program under this Act or other Acts administered by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The requirements of section 403(a) of the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1733(a)] shall apply with respect to commodities furnished under this subsection. Commodities may not be furnished for disposition to any country under this subsection except on determinations by the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the receiving country has the absorptive capacity to use the commodities efficiently and effectively; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) such disposition of the commodities will not interfere with usual marketings of the United States, nor disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities and normal patterns of commercial trade with developing countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The requirement for safeguarding usual marketings of the United States shall not be used to prevent the furnishing under this sub<!-- PDFPage:632 -->section of any eligible commodity for use in countries that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) have not traditionally purchased the commodity from the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) do not have adequate financial resources to acquire the commodity from the United States through commercial sources or through concessional sales arrangements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall take reasonable precautions to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) commodities furnished under this subsection will not displace or interfere with sales that otherwise might be made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) sales or barter under paragraph (7) will not unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities nor normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If eligible commodities are made available under this subsection to a friendly country, nonprofit and voluntary agencies and cooperatives shall also be eligible to receive commodities for food aid programs in the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Agreements may be entered into under this subsection to provide eligible commodities in installments over an extended period of time. In agreements with recipients of eligible commodities under this subsection (including nonprofit and voluntary agencies or cooperatives), subject to the availability of commodities each fiscal year, the Secretary, on request, shall approve multiyear agreements to make agricultural commodities available for distribution or sale by the recipients if the agreements otherwise meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Section 406 of the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1736] shall apply to the commodities furnished under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commodity Credit Corporation may pay the processing and domestic handling costs incurred, as authorized under this subsection, in the form of eligible commodities, as defined in paragraph (2)(A), if the Secretary determines that such in-kind payment will not disrupt domestic markets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The cost of commodities furnished under this subsection, and expenses incurred under section 406 of the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1736] in connection with those commodities, shall be in addition to the level of assistance programmed under that Act [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] and shall not be considered expenditures for international affairs and finance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Eligible commodities furnished under this subsection may be sold or bartered only with the approval of the Secretary and solely as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Sales and barter that are incidental to the donation of the commodities or products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Sales and barter to finance the distribution, handling, and processing costs of the donated commodities or products in the importing country or in a country through which such commodities or products must be transshipped, or other activities in the importing country that are consistent with providing food assistance to needy people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Sales and barter of commodities and products furnished to intergovernmental agencies or organizations, insofar as they are consistent with normal programming procedures in the distribution of commodities by those agencies or organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) Sales of commodities and products furnished to nonprofit and voluntary agencies, or cooperatives, for food assistance under agreements that provide for the use, by the agency or cooperative, of proceeds generated from such sale of commodities or products for the purposes established in clause (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Proceeds generated from partial or full sales or barter of commodities by a nonprofit and voluntary agency or cooperative shall be used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) to transport, store, distribute, and otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the use of commodities and the products thereof donated under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) to implement income generating, community development, health, nutrition, cooperative development, agricultural programs, and other developmental activities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In addition, proceeds generated in Poland may also be used by governmental and nongovernmental agencies or cooperatives for eligible activities approved by the joint commission established pursuant to section 2226 of the American Aid to Poland Act of 1988 and by the United States chief of diplomatic mission in Poland that would improve the quality of life of the Polish people and would strengthen and support the activities of governmental or private, nongovernmental independent institutions in Poland. Activities eligible under the preceding sentence include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) any project undertaken in Poland under the auspices of the Charitable Commission of the Polish Catholic Episcopate for the benefit of handicapped or orphaned children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) any project for the reconstruction, renovation, or maintenance of the Research Center on Jewish History and Culture of the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, Poland, established for the study of events related to the Holocaust in Poland;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) any other project or activity which strengthens and supports private and independent sectors of the Polish economy, especially independent farming and agriculture; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) the Polish Catholic Episcopate's Rural Water Supply Foundation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Except as otherwise provided in clause (v), such agreements, taken together for each fiscal year, shall provide for sales of commodities and products for proceeds in amounts that are, in the aggregate, not less than 10 percent of the aggregate value of all commodities and products furnished, or the minimum tonnage required, whichever is greater, for carrying out programs of assistance under this subsection in such fiscal year. The minimum allocation requirements of this clause apply with respect to commodities and products made available under this subsection for carrying out programs of assistance under titles II and III of the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq., 1727 et seq.], and not with respect to commodities and products made available to carry out the Food for Progress Act of 1985 [7 U.S.C. 1736<em>o</em>].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Proceeds generated from the sale of commodities or products under this subpara<!-- PDFPage:633 -->graph shall be expended within the country of origin within a reasonable length of time, as determined by the Secretary, except that the Secretary may permit the use of proceeds in a country other than the country of origin as necessary to expedite the transportation of commodities and products furnished under this subsection, or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) The provisions of clause (iii) of this subparagraph establishing minimum annual allocations for sales and use of proceeds shall not apply to the extent that there have not been sufficient requests for such sales and use of proceeds nor to the extent required under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Sales and barter to cover expenses incurred under paragraph (5)(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The provisions of sections 403(i) and 407(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1431_1_target" name="1431_1">1</a></sup> of the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1733(i), 1736a(c)] shall apply to donations, sales and barters of eligible commodities under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may approve the use of proceeds or services realized from the sale or barter of a commodity furnished under this subsection by a nonprofit voluntary agency, cooperative, or intergovernmental agency or organization to meet administrative expenses incurred in connection with activities undertaken under this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Availability; due date; procedures for repayment; applicability; security; limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture carry out a program authorized by section 424 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1433c]. Such program, if implemented, shall provide for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Advance recourse loans shall be made available only to those producers of a commodity who are unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance the production of the 1986 crop of that commodity, taking into consideration prevailing private and cooperative rates and terms for loans for similar purposes (as determined by the Secretary) in the community in or near which the applicant resides. A producer who has received a commitment or been furnished sufficient credit or a loan for production of the 1986 crop of a commodity shall not be eligible for an advance recourse loan to finance the production of that commodity for such crop year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Advance recourse loans shall be made available to producers of a commodity at the applicable nonrecourse loan rate for the commodity (as determined by the Secretary). Within the limits set out in paragraphs (5) and (7), advance recourse loans shall be available&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to producers of wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice who agree to participate in the program announced for the commodity on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm program yield for the commodity multiplied by the farm program acreage intended to be planted to the commodity for harvest in 1986, as determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to producers of peanuts who are on a farm for which a marketing quota or poundage quota has been established on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm marketing quota or poundage quota for the commodity, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to producers of other commodities on an amount of the commodity equal to one-half of the farm yield for the commodity multiplied by the farm acreage intended to be planted to the commodity for harvest in 1986, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An advance recourse loan under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] shall come due at such time immediately following harvest as the Secretary determines appropriate. Each loan contract entered into under section 424 shall specify the date on which the loan is to come due.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The Secretary shall establish procedures, when practicable, under which a producer, simultaneously with repayment of his recourse loan, may obtain a nonrecourse loan on his crop (as otherwise provided for in the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.]) in an amount sufficient to repay his recourse loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In cases in which nonrecourse loans under such Act are not normally made available directly to producers, the Secretary shall establish procedures under which a producer may repay a recourse loan at the same time the producer receives advances or other payment from the producer's disposition of his crop.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Advance recourse loans shall be made available as needed solely to cover costs involved in the production of the 1986 crop that are incurred or are outstanding on or after March 20, 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To obtain an advance recourse loan, the producer on a farm must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide as security for the loan a first lien on the crop covered by the loan or provide such other security as may be available to the producer and determined by the Secretary to be adequate to protect the Government's interests; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) obtain multiperil crop insurance, if available, to protect the crop that serves as security for the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If a producer does not have multiperil crop insurance and is located in a county in which the signup period for multiperil crop insurance has expired, the producer shall be required to obtain other crop insurance, if available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The total amount in advance recourse loans that may be made to a producer under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] may not exceed $50,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) An advance recourse loan may be made available only to a producer who agrees to comply with such other terms and conditions determined appropriate by the Secretary and consistent with the provisions of section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use of Commodity Credit Corporation, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, and county committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall carry out the program provided for under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] through the Commodity Credit Corporation, using the services of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service and the county committees established under section 590h(b) of title 16 to make determinations of eligibility with respect to the credit test under subsection (a)(1) of this section, and determinations as to the sufficiency of security under subsection (a)(6) of this section. The Secretary may use such committees for such other purposes as the Secretary determines appropriate in carrying out section 424.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture issue or, as appropriate, amend regulations to implement any program established under section 424 [7 U.S.C. 1433c] as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after March 20, 1986. Loans and other assistance provided under such program shall be made available beginning on the date such regulations are issued or amended.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) During any year in which no set-aside or diversion of acreage is in effect under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], the Secretary of Agriculture may formulate and administer a program for the production, subject to such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, of commodities for conversion into alcohol or hydrocarbons for use as motor fuel or other fuel. Under such program, producers of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice shall be paid incentive payments to devote a portion of their acreage to such production.</p>

Such payments shall be made in such monetary amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines will make rice produced in the United States available at competitive prices consistent with the purposes of this section, including such payments as may be necessary to make rice in inventory on August 1, 1986, available on the same basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of value of certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The value of each certificate issued under subsection (a) of this section shall be based on the difference between&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Commodity Credit Corporation assistance in redemption, marketing, or exchange of certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commodity Credit Corporation, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, may assist any person receiving marketing certificates under this section in the redemption of certificates for cash, or marketing or exchange of such certificates for (1) rice owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation or (2) (if the Secretary and the person agree) other agricultural commodities or the products thereof owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation, at such times, in such manner, and at such price levels as the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the program established under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any price restrictions that may otherwise apply to the disposition of agricultural commodities by the Commodity Credit Corporation shall not apply to the redemption of certificates under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exchange of certificates for commodities and products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Insofar as practicable, the Secretary shall permit owners of certificates to designate the commodities and the products thereof, including storage sites thereof, such owners would prefer to receive in exchange for certificates. If any certificate is not presented for redemption, marketing, or exchange within a reasonable number of days after the issuance of such certificate (as determined by the Secretary), reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges, as determined by the Secretary, shall be deducted from the value of the certificate for the period beginning after such reasonable number of days and ending with the date of the presentation of such certificate to the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prevention of adverse effects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall take such measures as may be necessary to prevent the marketing or exchange of agricultural commodities and the products thereof for certificates under this section from adversely affecting the income of producers of such commodities or products.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever base acreages are in effect for corn, the Secretary shall require, as a condition of eligibility for price support on corn, that the producer (1) devote an acreage of cropland (tilled in normal rotation), at the option of the producer, to either the acreage reserve program for corn or the conservation reserve program, equal to 15 per centum of such producer's farm base acreage for corn, and (2) not exceed such farm base acreage for corn: <em>Provided</em>, That price support may be made available to any producer who does not meet the foregoing requirements at such level, not in excess of the level of price support to producers who meet such requirements, as the Secretary determines will facilitate the effective operation of the price support program. Corn acreage allotments shall not be effective for the 1956 crop.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Referendum of producers of corn</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than December 15, 1956, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of producers of corn in 1956 in the commercial corn-producing area to determine whether such producers favor a price-support program as provided in subsection (c) of this section for the 1957 and subsequent crops in lieu of acreage allotments as provided in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.], and price support as provided in section 1441 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restriction on acreage allotment of corn; price support level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if two-thirds or more of the producers voting in the referendum conducted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section favor a price-support program as provided in this subsection, no acreage allotment of corn shall be established for the commercial corn-producing area for any county, or for any farm, with respect to the 1957 and subsequent crops, and price support made available for such crops by Commodity Credit Corporation shall be at such level as the Secretary determines will assist producers in marketing corn in the normal channels of trade but not encourage the uneconomic production of corn.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Price support level for 1956 and 1957 crops of grain sorghums, barley, rye, oats, and corn</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, (1) the level of price support for the 1956 crop of grain sorghums, barley, rye, and oats, respectively, shall be 76 per centum of the parity price for the commodity as of May 1, 1956, (2) the level of price support for corn produced outside the commercial corn-producing area, for any crop for which base acreages are in effect (except as provided in (3) below), shall be 821/2 per centum of the level of price support for corn in the commercial corn-producing area to producers complying with acreage limitations, and (3) if price support is made available for the 1957 crop of corn in the commercial corn-producing area to producers not complying with acreage limitations, price support shall be made available for the 1957 crop of grain sorghums, barley, rye, oats, and corn produced outside the commercial corn-producing area, respectively, at a level, not less than 70 per centum of the parity price as of the beginning of the marketing year, determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable in relation to the level at which price support is made available for corn in the commercial corn-producing area to producers not complying with acreage limitations, taking into consideration the normal price relationships between such commodity and corn in the commercial area, the feed value of such commodity in relation to corn, the supply of such commodity in relation to the demand therefor, and the ability to dispose of stocks of such commodity acquired through price support programs.</p>

Such additional support shall be at a level up to 15 per centum in excess of the basic level of support established under subsection (a) of this section and shall be provided on the normal yield of the acreage planted for harvest within the farm domestic allotment. For purposes of this subsection, an acreage on the farm which the Secretary finds was not planted to cotton in 1965 because of flood, drought, or other natural disaster shall be deemed by the Secretary to be an actual acreage of cotton planted on the farm for harvest, provided such acreage is not subsequently devoted to any price supported crop for 1965.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Alternative operations for carrying out additional price support; payment-in-kind certificates: value, marketing assistance, redemption, and deductions after thirty day period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to keep upland cotton to the maximum extent practicable in the normal channels of trade, any additional price support under subsection (b) of this section may be carried out through the simultaneous purchase of cotton at the support price therefor under subsection (b) of this section and the sale of such cotton at the support price therefor under subsection (a) of this section or similar operations, including loans under which the cotton would be redeemable by payment of the amount for which the cotton would be redeemable if the loan thereon had been made at the support price for such cotton under subsection (a) of this section, or payments-in-kind through the issuance of certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation shall redeem for cotton under regulations issued by the Secretary. If such additional support is provided through the issuance of payment-in-kind certificates, such certificates shall have a value per pound of cotton equal to the difference between the level of support established under subsection (a) of this section and the level of support established under subsection (b) of this section. The corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producers and persons receiving payment-in-kind certificates under this section and section 1348 of this title, in the marketing of such certificates at such time and in such manner as the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the program authorized by this section and such section 1348. In the case of any certificate not presented for redemption within thirty days of the date of its issuance, reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges as determined by the Secretary for the period beginning thirty days after its issuance and ending with the date of its presentation for redemption shall be deducted from the value of the certificate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if producers have not disapproved marketing quotas, price support and diversion payments shall be made available for the 1966 through 1970 crops of upland cotton as provided in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Price support for each such crop of upland cotton shall be made available to cooperators through loans at such level, not exceeding a level which will reflect for Middling one-inch upland cotton at average location in the United States 90 per centum of the estimated average world market price for Middling one-inch upland cotton for the marketing year for such crop, as the Secretary determines will provide orderly marketing of cotton during the harvest season and will retain an adequate share of the world market for cotton produced in the United States taking into consideration the factors specified in section 1421(b) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That the national average loan rate for the 1966 crop shall reflect 21 cents per pound for Middling one-inch upland cotton.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">shall not be less than 65 per centum or more than 90 per centum of the parity price for cotton as of the month in which the payment rate provided for by this paragraph is announced. Such payments shall be made on the quantity of cotton determined by multiplying the projected farm yield by the acreage planted to cotton within the farm domestic acreage allotment: <em>Provided</em>, That any such farm planting not less than 90 per centum of such domestic acreage allotment shall be deemed to have planted the entire amount of such allotment. An acreage on a farm in any such year which the Secretary finds was not planted to cotton because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster shall be deemed to be planted to cotton for purposes of payments under this subsection if such acreage is not subsequently devoted to any other crop for which there are marketing quotas or voluntary adjustment programs in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall make diversion payments in cash or in kind in addition to the price support payments authorized in paragraph (3) to cooperators who reduce their cotton acreage by diverting a portion of their cotton acreage allotment from the production of cotton to approved <!-- PDFPage:651 -->conservation practices to the extent prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That no reduction below the domestic acreage allotments established under section 1350 of this title shall be prescribed: <em>Provided further</em>, That payment under this paragraph shall be made available for diverting to conserving uses that part of the acreage allotment which must be diverted from cotton in order that the producer may qualify as a cooperator. The rate of payment for acreage required to be diverted in order to qualify as a cooperator shall not be less than 25 per centum of the parity price for upland cotton as of the month in which such rate is announced. The rate of payment for additional acreage diverted shall be such rate as the Secretary determines to be fair and reasonable, but shall not exceed 40 per centum of such parity price. Payment at each applicable rate shall be made on the quantity of cotton determined by multiplying the acreage diverted from the production of cotton at such rate by the projected farm yield. In addition to the foregoing payment, if any, payment at the rate applicable for acreage required to be diverted to qualify as a cooperator shall be made to producers on small farms as defined in section 1428(b) of this title who do not exceed their farm acreage allotments on a quantity of cotton determined by multiplying an acreage equal to 35 per centum of such farm acreage allotment by the projected farm yield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of the payments under this subsection to producers in advance of determination of performance and the balance of such payments shall be made at such time as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Where the farm operator elects to participate in the diversion program authorized in this subsection and no acreage is planted to cotton on the farm, diversion payments shall be made at the rate established under paragraph (4) for acreage required to be diverted to qualify as a cooperator on the quantity of cotton determined by multiplying that part of the farm acreage allotment required to be diverted to qualify as a cooperator by the projected farm yield, and the remainder of such allotment may be released under the provisions of section 1344(m)(2) of this title. The acreage on which payment is made under this paragraph shall be regarded as planted to cotton for purposes of establishing future State, county, and farm acreage allotments, and farm bases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Payments in kind under this subsection shall be made through the issuance of certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation shall redeem for cotton under regulations issued by the Secretary at a value per pound equal to not less than the current loan rate therefor. The Corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producers in the marketing of such certificates at such times and in such manner as the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the program authorized by this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Payments under this subsection shall be conditioned on the farm having an acreage of approved conservation uses equal to the sum of (i) the reduction in cotton acreage required to qualify for such payments (hereinafter called &ldquo;diverted acreage&rdquo;), and (ii) the average acreage of cropland on the farm devoted to designated soil-conserving crops or practices, including summer fallow and idle land, during a base period prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary may permit all or any part of such diverted acreage to be devoted to the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, and flaxseed, if he determines that such production is necessary to provide an adequate supply of such commodities, is not likely to increase the cost of the price support program, and will not adversely affect farm income, subject to the condition that payment under paragraph (4) or (6) with respect to diverted acreage devoted to any such crop shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the use of such acreage for the production of such crops, but in no event shall the payment exceed one-half the rate which otherwise would be applicable if such acreage were devoted to conservation uses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The acreage regarded as planted to cotton on any farm which qualifies for payment under this subsection except under paragraph (6) shall, for purposes of establishing future State, county, and farm acreage allotments and farm bases, be the farm acreage allotment established under section 1344 of this title, excluding adjustments under subsection (m)(2) thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) The Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers, including provision for sharing diversion payments on a fair and equitable basis under this subsection. The Secretary shall provide for the sharing of price support payments among producers on the farm on the basis of their respective shares in the cotton crop produced on the farm, or the proceeds therefrom, except that in any case in which the Secretary determines that such basis would not be fair and equitable, the Secretary shall provide for such sharing on such other basis as he may determine to be fair and equitable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) In any case in which the failure of a producer to comply fully with the terms and conditions of the programs formulated under this Act preclude the making of payments under this section, the Secretary may, nevertheless, make such payments in such amounts as he determines to be equitable in relation to the seriousness of the default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(12) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if, as a result of limitations hereafter enacted with respect to price support under this subsection, the Secretary is unable to make available to all cooperators the full amount of price support to which they would otherwise be entitled under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection for any crop of upland cotton, (A) price support to cooperators shall be made available for such crop (if marketing quotas have not been disapproved) through loans or purchases at such level not less than 65 per centum nor more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor as the Secretary determines appropriate; (B) in order to keep upland cotton to the maximum extent practicable in the normal channels of trade, such price support may be carried out through the simultaneous purchase of cotton at the sup<!-- PDFPage:652 -->port price therefor and resale at a lower price or through loans under which the cotton would be redeemable by payment of a price therefor lower than the amount of the loan thereon; and (C) such resale or redemption price shall be such as the Secretary determines will provide orderly marketing of cotton during the harvest season and will retain an adequate share of the world market for cotton produced in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(13) The provisions of section 590h(g) of title 16 (relating to assignment of payments), shall also apply to payments under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Price support, diversion, and cropland set-aside program for crops beginning with 1971 crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall upon presentation of warehouse receipts reflecting accrued storage charges of not more than 60 days make available for the 1971 through 1977 crops of upland cotton to cooperators nonrecourse loans for a term of ten months from the first day of the month in which the loan is made at such level as will reflect the Middling one-inch upland cotton (micronaire 3.5 through 4.9) at average location in the United States 90 per centum of the average price of American cotton in world markets for such cotton for the three-year period ending July 31 in the year in which the loan level is announced, except that if the loan rate so calculated is higher than the then current level of average world prices for American cotton of such quality, the Secretary is authorized to adjust the current calculated loan rate for cotton to 90 per centum of the then current average world price. The average world price for such cotton for such preceding three-year period shall be determined by the Secretary annually pursuant to a published regulation which shall specify the procedures and the factors to be used by the Secretary in making the world price determination. The loan level for any crop of upland cotton shall be determined and announced not later than November 1 of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which such loan is to be effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the carryover of upland cotton as of the beginning of the marketing year for any of the 1972 or 1973 crops exceeds 7.2 million bales, producers on any farm harvesting cotton of such crop from an acreage in excess of the base acreage allotment for such farm shall be entitled to loans and purchases only on an amount of the cotton of such crop produced on such farm determined by multiplying the yield used in computing payments for such farm by the base acreage allotment for such farm.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is less than the established price of 38 cents per pound in the case of the 1974 and 1975 crops, 38 cents per pound adjusted to reflect any change during the calendar year 1975 in the index of prices paid by farmers for production items, interest, taxes, and wage rates in the case of the 1976 crop, and the established price for the 1976 crop adjusted to reflect any change during the calendar year 1976 in such index in the case of the 1977 crop: <em>Provided</em>, That any increase that would otherwise be made in the established price to reflect a change in the index of prices paid by farmers shall be adjusted to reflect any change in (i) the national average yield per acre of cotton for the three calendar years preceding the year for which the determination is made, over (ii) the national average yield per acre of cotton for the three calendar years preceding the year previous to the one for which the determination is made. If the Secretary determines that the producers on a farm are prevented from planting any portion of the allotment to cotton because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or condition beyond the control of the producer, the rate of payment for such portion shall be the larger of (A) the foregoing rate, or (B) one-third of the established price. If the Secretary determines that, because of such a disaster or condition, the total quantity of cotton which the producers are able to harvest on any farm is less than 662/3 percent of the farm base acreage allotment times the average yield established for the farm, the rate of payment for the deficiency in production below 100 percent shall be the larger of (A) the foregoing rate, or (B) one-third of the established price. The payment rate with respect to any producer who (i) is on a small farm (that is, a farm on which the base acreage allotment is ten acres or less, or on which the yield used in making payments times the farm base acreage allotment is five thousand pounds or less, and for which the base acreage allotment has not been reduced under section 1350(f) of this title, (ii) resides on such farm, and (iii) derives his principal income from cotton produced on such farm, shall be increased by 30 per centum; but, notwithstanding paragraph (3), such increase shall be made only with respect to his share of cotton actually harvested on such farm within the quantity specified in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such payments shall be made available for a farm on the quantity of upland cotton determined by multiplying the acreage planted within the farm base acreage allotment for the farm for the crop by the average yield established for the farm: <em>Provided</em>, That payments shall be made on any farm planting not less than 90 per centum of the farm base acreage allotment on the basis of the entire amount of such allotment. For purposes of this paragraph, an acreage on the farm which the Secretary determines was not planted to cotton because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or a condition beyond the control of the producer shall be considered to be an acreage planted to cotton. The average yield for the farm for any year shall be determined on the basis of the actual yields per harvested acre for the three preceding years, except that the <!-- PDFPage:653 -->1970 farm projected yield shall be substituted in lieu of the actual yields for the years 1968 and 1969: <em>Provided</em>, That the actual yields shall be adjusted by the Secretary for abnormal yields in any year caused by drought, flood, or other natural disaster: <em>Provided further</em>, That the average yield established for the farm for any year shall not be less than the yield used in making payments for the preceding year if the total cotton production on the farm in such preceding year is not less than the yield used in making payments for the farm for such preceding year times the farm base acreage allotment for such preceding year (for the 1970 crop, the farm domestic allotment).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary shall provide for a set aside of cropland if he determines that the total supply of agricultural commodities will, in the absence of such a set-aside, likely be excessive taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices and to meet a national emergency. If a set-aside of cropland is in effect under this paragraph (4), then as a condition of eligibility for loans and payments on upland cotton the producers on a farm must set aside and devote to approved conservation uses an acreage of cropland equal to (i) such percentage of the farm base acreage allotment for the farm as may be specified by the Secretary (not to exceed 28 per centum of the farm base acreage allotment), plus, if required by the Secretary, (ii) the acreage of cropland on the farm devoted in preceding years to soil conserving uses, as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary is authorized for the 1974 through 1977 crops to limit the acreage planted to upland cotton on the farm in excess of the farm base acreage allotment to a percentage of the farm base acreage allotment. The Secretary shall permit producers to plant and graze on set-aside acreage sweet sorghum, and the Secretary may permit, subject to such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, all or any of the set-aside acreage to be devoted to hay and grazing or the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, flaxseed, triticale, oats, rye, or other commodity, if he determines that such production is needed to provide an adequate supply, is not likely to increase the cost of the price-support program, and will not adversely affect farm income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) To assist in adjusting the acreage of commodities to desirable goals, the Secretary may make land diversion payments, in addition to the payments authorized in subsection (e)(2) of this section, to producers on a farm who, to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, devote to approved conservation uses an acreage of cropland on the farm in addition to that required to be so devoted under subsection (e)(4)(A) of this section. The land diversion payments for a farm shall be at such rate or rates as the Secretary determines to be fair and reasonable taking into consideration to the diversion undertaken by the producers and the productivity of the acreage diverted. The Secretary shall limit the total acreage to be diverted under agreements in any county or local community so as not to adversely affect the economy of the county or local community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The upland cotton program formulated under this section shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to protect the set-aside acreage and the additional diverted acreage from erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents. Such acreage may be devoted to wildlife food plots or wildlife habitat in conformity with standards established by the Secretary in consultation with wildlife agencies. The Secretary may in the case of programs for the 1974 through 1977 crops, pay an appropriate share of the cost of practices designed to carry out the purposes of the foregoing sentences. The Secretary may provide for an additional payment on such acreage in an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate in relation to the benefit to the general public if the producer agrees to permit, without other compensation, access to all or such portion of the farm as the Secretary may prescribe by the general public, for hunting, trapping, fishing, and hiking, subject to applicable State and Federal regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If the operator of the farm desires to participate in the program formulated under this section, he shall file his agreement to do so no later than such date as the Secretary may prescribe. Loans and purchases on upland cotton and payments under this section shall be made available to the producers on such farm only if producers set aside and devote to approved soil conserving uses an acreage on the farm equal to the number of acres which the operator agrees to set aside and devote to approved soil conserving uses, and the agreement shall so provide. The Secretary may, by mutual agreement with the producer, terminate or modify any such agreement entered into pursuant to this subsection (e)(6) if he determines such action necessary because of an emergency created by drought or other disaster or in order to alleviate a shortage in the supply of agricultural commodities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers, including provision for sharing on a fair and equitable basis, in payments under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In any case in which the failure of a producer to comply fully with the terms and conditions of the program formulated under this section precludes the making of loans, purchases, and payments, the Secretary may, nevertheless, make such loans, purchases, and payments in such amounts as he determines to be equitable in relation to the seriousness of the default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The Secretary is authorized to issue such regulations as he determines necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Program for extra long staple cotton beginning with 1984 crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this subsection, extra long staple cotton means cotton which is produced from pure strain varieties of the Barbadense spe<!-- PDFPage:654 -->cies or any hybrid thereof, or other similar types of extra long staple cotton, designated by the Secretary, having characteristics needed for various end uses for which American upland cotton is not suitable and grown in irrigated cotton-growing regions of the United States designated by the Secretary or other areas designated by the Secretary as suitable for the production of such varieties or types and which is ginned on a roller-type gin or, if authorized by the Secretary, ginned on another type gin for experimental purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall, upon presentation of warehouse receipts reflecting accrued storage charges of not more than sixty days, make available to producers nonrecourse loans for a term of ten months from the first day of the month in which the loan is made at a level which is not less than 85 percent of the simple average price received by producers of extra long staple cotton, as determined by the Secretary, during 3 years of the 5-year period ending July 31 in the year in which the loan level is announced, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period..<sup><a href="#1444_2_target" name="1444_2">2</a></sup> If authorized by the Secretary, nonrecourse loans provided for in this subsection may, upon request of the producer during the tenth month of the loan period for the cotton, be made available for an additional term of eight months. The loan level for any crop of extra long staple cotton shall be determined and announced by the Secretary not later than December 1 of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which such loan is to be effective and such level shall not thereafter be changed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">is less than the established price per pound times, in each case, the farm program acreage for extra long staple cotton (determined in accordance with paragraph (5)(A), but in no event on a greater acreage than the acreage actually planted to extra long staple cotton for harvest), multiplied by the farm program payment yield for extra long staple cotton (determined in accordance with paragraph (4)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The established price for each crop of extra long staple cotton shall be 120 per centum of the loan level determined for such crop under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Secretary establishes an acreage limitation program for a crop of extra long staple cotton in accordance with paragraph (5)(A) and determines that deficiency payments will likely be made for such crop of extra long staple cotton under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary may make available advance deficiency payments for such crop to producers who agree to participate in the acreage limitation program. Such advance payments shall be made available to producers as soon as practicable after the producer files a notice of intention to participate in such acreage limitation program and in such amount as the Secretary determines appropriate to encourage adequate participation in such program, except that such amount shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying (i) the estimated farm program acreage for the crop, by (ii) the farm program payment yield for the crop, by (iii) 50 per centum of the projected payment rate, as determined by the Secretary. In any case in which the deficiency payment payable to a producer for a crop, as finally determined by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, is less than the amount paid to the producer as an advance deficiency payment under this paragraph, the producer shall refund an amount equal to the difference between the amount advanced and the amount finally determined by the Secretary to be payable to the producer. If the Secretary determines that no deficiency payments are due producers on a crop, the producer who received advanced payments on such crop shall refund such payments. If a producer fails to comply with the requirements under the acreage limitation program after obtaining an advance deficiency payment under this paragraph, the producer shall immediately repay the amount of the advance, plus interest thereon in such amount as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The farm program payment yield for each crop of extra long staple cotton shall be determined on the basis of the actual yields per harvested acre on the farm for the preceding three years, except that the actual yields shall be adjusted by the Secretary for abnormal yields in any year caused by drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers. In case farm yield data for one or more years are unavailable or there was no production, the Secretary shall provide for appraisals to be made on the basis of actual yields and program payment yields for similar farms in the area for which data are available. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph in the determination of yields, the Secretary shall take into account the actual yields proved by the producer, and neither such yields nor the farm program payment yield established on the basis of such yields shall be reduced under other provisions of this paragraph. If the Secretary determines it necessary, the Secretary may establish national, State, or county program payment yields on the basis of historical yields, as adjusted by the Secretary to correct for abnormal factors affecting such yields in the historical period, or, if such data are not available, on the Secretary's estimate of actual yields for the crop year involved. If national, State, or county program payment yields are established, the farm program payment yields shall balance to the national, State, or county program payment yields.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the Secretary may establish a limitation on the acreage planted to extra long staple cotton if the Secretary determines <!-- PDFPage:655 -->that the total supply of extra long staple cotton, in the absence of such limitation, will be excessive taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable prices and to meet a national emergency. Such limitation shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (including a zero percentage reduction) to the acreage base for each extra long staple cotton-producing farm. Producers who knowingly produce extra long staple cotton in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm shall be ineligible for extra long staple cotton loans and payments with respect to that farm. The acreage base for any farm for the purpose of determining any reduction required to be made for any year as a result of a limitation under this subparagraph shall be the average acreage planted on the farm to extra long staple cotton for harvest in the three crop years immediately preceding the year prior to the year for which the determination is made. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, acreage planted to extra long staple cotton for harvest shall include any acreage which the producers were prevented from planting to extra long staple cotton or other nonconserving crops in lieu of extra long staple cotton because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster or other condition beyond the control of the producers. The Secretary may make adjustments to reflect established crop-rotation practices and to reflect such other factors as the Secretary determines should be considered in determining a fair and equitable base. There is hereby established for the 1984, 1985, and 1986 crops an acreage base reserve equal to 5 per centum of the total of the farm acreage bases established for the crop under the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph. Such reserve shall be in addition to the total of the farm acreage bases and shall be used by the county committees, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, for making adjustments of farm acreage bases to correct inequities and prevent hardship, and for establishing bases for farms on which no extra long staple cotton was planted during the preceding four years. A number of acres on the farm determined by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying the number of acres required to be withdrawn from the production of extra long staple cotton times the number of acres actually planted to such commodity, by (ii) the number of acres authorized to be planted to such commodity under the limitation established by the Secretary, shall be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, which will assure protection of such acreage from weeds and wind and water erosion. The number of acres so determined is hereafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;reduced acreage&rdquo;. The Secretary may permit, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of the reduced acreage to be devoted to sweet sorghum, hay and grazing, or the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, flaxseed, triticale, rye, or other commodity, if the Secretary determines that such production is needed to provide an adequate supply of such commodities, is not likely to increase the cost of the price support program, and will not affect farm income adversely. The individual farm program acreage shall be the actual acreage planted on the farm to extra long staple cotton for harvest within the permitted extra long staple cotton acreage for the farm as established under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Secretary shall ensure, under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary, that the total of the crop acreage bases established on a farm which is enrolled in a production adjustment program for any commodity shall not be increased as a result of the application of the provisions set forth in paragraph (13)(C), as extended for the 1989 and 1990 crop.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may make land diversion payments to producers of extra long staple cotton, whether or not an acreage limitation program for extra long staple cotton is in effect, if the Secretary determines that such land diversion payments are necessary to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of extra long staple cotton to desirable goals. Such land diversion payments shall be made to producers who, to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, devote to approved conservation uses an acreage of cropland on the farm in accordance with land diversion contracts entered into by the Secretary with such producers. The amounts payable to producers under land diversion contracts may be determined through the submission of bids for such contracts by producers in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe or through such other means as the Secretary determines appropriate. In determining the acceptability of contract offers, the Secretary shall take into consideration the extent of the diversion to be undertaken by the producers and the productivity of the acreage diverted. The Secretary shall limit the total acreage to be diverted under agreements in any county or local community so as not to affect adversely the economy of the county or local community.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Referendum of 1958 corn producers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than December 15, 1958, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of producers of corn in 1958 in the commercial corn-producing area for 1958 to determine whether such producers favor a price support program as provided in subsection (b) of this section for the 1959 and subsequent crops in lieu of acreage allotments as provided in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.], and price support as provided in section 1441 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Operative status of certain provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if less than a majority of the producers voting in the referendum conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section favor a price support program as provided in this subsection (b), the following provisions of law shall become inoperative:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) [Section enacted section 1329a of this title.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) [Section enacted section 1444b of this title.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) [Section repealed section 1441(d)(4) of this title.]</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cotton research program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture is hereby authorized and directed to conduct a special cotton research program designed to reduce the cost of producing upland cotton in the United States at the earliest practicable date. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums, not to exceed $10,000,000 annually, as may be necessary for the Secretary to carry out this special research program. The Secretary shall report annually to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate with respect to the results of such research.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cotton insect eradication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to reduce cotton production costs, to prevent the movement of certain cotton plant insects to areas not now infested, and to enhance the quality of the environment, the Secretary is authorized and directed to carry out programs to destroy and eliminate cotton boll weevils in infested areas of the United States as provided herein and to carry out similar programs with respect to pink bollworms or any other major cotton insect if the Secretary determines that methods and systems have been developed to the point that success in eradication of such insects is assured. The Secretary shall carry out the eradication programs authorized by this subsection through the Commodity Credit Corporation. In carrying out insect eradication projects, the Secretary shall utilize the technical and related services of appropriate Federal, State, private agencies, and cotton organizations. Producers and landowners in an eradication zone, established by the Secretary, who are receiving benefits from any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, shall, as a condition of receiving or continuing any such benefits, participate in and cooperate with the eradication project, as specified in regulations of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may issue such regulations as he deems necessary to enforce the provisions of this subsection with respect to achieving the compliance of producers and landowners who are not receiving benefits from any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture. Any person who knowingly violates any such regulation promulgated by the Secretary under this subsection may be assessed a civil penalty of not to exceed $5,000 for each offense. No civil penalty shall be assessed unless the person shall have been given notice and opportunity for a hearing on such charge in the county, parish, or incorporated city of the residence of the person charged. In determining the amount of the penalty the Secretary shall consider the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, the effect on the person's ability to continue in business, and the gravity of the violation. Where special measures deemed essential to achievement of the eradication objective are taken by the project and result in a loss of production and income to the producer, the Secretary shall provide reasonable and equitable indemnification from funds available for the project and also provide for appropriate protection of the allotment, acreage history, and average yield for the farm. The cost of the program in each eradication zone shall be determined, and cotton producers in the zone shall be required to pay up to one-half thereof, with the exact share in each zone area to be specified by the Secretary upon his finding that such share is reasonable and equitable based on population levels of the target insect and the degree of control measures normally required. Each producer's pro rata share shall be deducted from his cotton payment under this Act or otherwise collected, as provided in regulations of the Secretary. Insofar as practicable, cotton producers and other persons engaged in cotton production in the eradication zone shall be employed to participate in the work of the project in such zone. Funding of the program shall be terminated at such time as the Secretary determines and reports to the Congress that complete eradication of the insects for which programs are undertaken pursuant to this subsection has been accomplished. Funds in custody of agencies carrying out the program shall, upon termination of such program, be accounted for to the Secretary for appropriate disposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to cooperate with the Government of Mexico in carrying out operations or measures in Mexico which he deems necessary and feasible to prevent the movement into the United States from Mexico of any insects eradicated under the provisions of this subsection. The measure and character of cooperation carried out under this subsection on the part of the United States and on the part of the Government of Mexico, including the expenditure or use of funds made available by the Secretary under this subsection, shall be such as <!-- PDFPage:661 -->may be prescribed by the Secretary. Arrangements for the cooperations authorized by this subsection shall be made through and in consultation with the Secretary of State. The Commodity Credit Corporation shall not make any expenditures for carrying out the purposes of this subsection unless the Corporation has received funds to cover such expenditures from appropriations made to carry out the purposes of this subsection. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Commodity Credit Corporation such sums as the Congress may from time to time determine to be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1441 of this title, beginning with the 1964 crop&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Price support for wheat accompanied by domestic certificates shall be at such level not less than 65 per centum or more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration the factors specified in section 1421(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Price support for wheat accompanied by export certificates shall be at such level not more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration the factors specified in section 1421(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Price support for wheat not accompanied by marketing certificates shall be at such level, not in excess of 90 per centum of the parity price therefor, as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration competitive world prices of wheat, the feeding value of wheat in relation to feed grains, and the level at which price support is made available for feed grains.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Price support shall be made available only to cooperators: and, if a commercial wheat-producing area is established for such crop, price support shall be made available only in the commercial wheat-producing area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Effective with respect to crops planted for harvest in the calendar year 1966 and any subsequent year, the level of price support for any crop of wheat for which a national marketing quota is not proclaimed or for which marketing quotas have been disapproved by producers shall be as provided in section 1441 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A &ldquo;cooperator&rdquo; with respect to any crop of wheat produced on a farm shall be a producer who (i) does not knowingly exceed (A) the farm acreage allotment for wheat on the farm or (B) except as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, the farm acreage allotment for wheat on any other farm on which the producer shares in the production of wheat, and (ii) complies with the land-use requirements of section 1339 of this title, to the extent prescribed by the Secretary. Effective with respect to crops planted for harvest in the calendar year 1966 and any subsequent year, if marketing quotas are not in effect for the crop of wheat, a &ldquo;cooperator&rdquo; with respect to any crop of wheat produced on a farm shall be a producer who does not knowingly exceed the farm acreage allotment for wheat. No pro<!-- PDFPage:670 -->ducer shall be deemed to have exceeded a farm acreage allotment for wheat if the entire amount of the farm marketing excess is delivered to the Secretary or stored in accordance with applicable regulations to avoid or postpone payment of the penalty, but the producer shall not be eligible to receive price support on such marketing excess. No producer shall be deemed to have exceeded the farm acreage allotment for wheat on any other farm, if such farm is exempt from the farm marketing quota for such crop under section 1335 of this title. No producer shall be deemed to have exceeded a farm acreage allotment for wheat if the production on the acreage in excess of the farm acreage allotment is stored pursuant to the provisions of section 1379c(b) of this title, but the producer shall not be eligible to receive price support on the wheat so stored.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to administer a special wheat acreage grazing and hay program (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;special program&rdquo;) in each of the crop years 1978 through 1990. If a special program is implemented, a producer shall be permitted to designate, under such regulations as established by the Secretary, a portion of the acreage on the farm intended to be planted to wheat, feed grains, or upland cotton for harvest, not in excess of 40 per centum thereof, or 50 acres, whichever is greater, which shall be planted to wheat (or some other commodity other than corn or grain sorghum) and used by the producer for grazing purposes or hay rather than for commercial grain production. A producer who elects to participate in the special program shall receive a payment as provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Specific farm acreage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any producer who elects to participate in the special program under this section shall designate the specific acreage on the farm which is to be used for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) of this section. No crop other than hay may be harvested from acreage included in the special program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall pay the producer participating in the special program an amount determined by multiplying the farm program payment yield for wheat established for the farm, by the number of acres included in the special program, by a rate of payment determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable. The producer shall not be eligible for any other payment or price support on any portion of the acreage for the farm which the producer elects to include in the special program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other acreage set-aside programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Acreage included in the special program shall be in addition to any acreage included in any acreage set-aside, reduced acreage, or land diversion program otherwise provided for by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall provide for the reduction (measured in cents per hundredweight of milk marketed) under subparagraph (A) during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on September 30 of such fiscal year as the sole means of achieving any reduction in budget outlays under the milk price-support program that otherwise would be required under either such order and only for the purpose of substituting for any reduction in payments made by the Secretary for the purchase of milk or the products of milk under either such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The aggregate amount of any reduction under subparagraph (A) resulting from the operation of clause (i) may not exceed the aggregate amount of the reduction in budget outlays under the milk price-support program, as estimated by the Secretary, that otherwise would have been achieved under either such order by reducing payments made by the Secretary for the purchase of milk or the products of milk under this subsection during such fiscal year.</p>

Such procedures also shall ensure that such sales of dairy cattle for slaughter shall occur on a basis estimated by the Secretary that maintains historical seasonal marketing patterns. During such 18-month period, the Secretary shall limit the total number of dairy cattle marketed for slaughter under the program in excess of the historical dairy herd <!-- PDFPage:683 -->culling rate to no more than 7 percent of the national dairy herd per calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Each producer who markets milk and each person required to make payment to the Corporation under this subsection shall keep such records and make such reports, in such manner, as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary may make such investigations as the Secretary deems necessary for the effective administration of this subsection or to determine whether any person subject to the provisions of this subsection has engaged or is engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice that constitutes or will constitute a violation of any provision of this subsection or regulation issued under this subsection. For the purpose of such investigation, the Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any records that are relevant to the inquiry.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) The district courts of the United States are vested with jurisdiction specifically to enforce, and to prevent and restrain any person from violating, any provision of this subsection or any regulation issued under this subsection. Any such civil action authorized to be brought under this subsection shall be referred to the Attorney General for appropriate action. The Secretary is not required, however, to refer to the Attorney General minor violations of this subsection whenever the Secretary believes that the administration and enforcement of this subsection would be adequately served by suitable written notice or warning to any person committing such violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Each person as to whom there is a failure to make a reduction in the price of milk received by such person as required by paragraph (2) or who fails to remit to the Corporation the funds required to be collected and remitted by paragraph (2)(B) shall be liable, in addition to any amount due, to a marketing penalty at a rate equal to the support price for milk in effect at the time the failure occurs on the quantity of milk as to which the failure applies. The Secretary may reduce any such marketing penalty in such amount as the Secretary determines equitable in any case in which the Secretary determines that the failure was unintentional or without knowledge on the part of the person concerned. Each person who knowingly violates any other provision of this subsection, or any regulation issued under this subsection, shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each such violation. Any penalty provided for under this subparagraph shall be assessed by the Secretary after notice and opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Each person who buys, from a producer with respect to whom there is in effect at the time of such sale a contract entered into under paragraph (3), one or more dairy cattle sold for slaughter or export, who knows that such cattle are sold for slaughter or export, and who fails to cause the slaughter or export of such cattle within a reasonable time after receiving such cattle shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 with respect to each of such cattle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Each person who retains or acquires an interest in dairy cattle or the production of milk in violation of a contract entered into under this paragraph shall be liable, in addition to any amount due under paragraph (3)(A)(iv), to a marketing penalty on the quantity of milk produced during the period in which such ownership is prohibited under the contract. Such penalty shall be computed at the rate or rates of the support price for milk in effect during the period in which the milk production occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Each person who makes a false statement in a bid submitted under paragraph (3) as to (I) the marketings of milk for commercial use by the producer, or (II) the size or composition of the dairy herd that produced such marketings, or (III) the size or composition of the dairy herd at the time the bid is submitted shall be subject, in addition to any amount due under paragraph (3)(A)(iv) or clause (iii) of this subparagraph, to a civil penalty of $5,000 for each head of cattle to which such statement applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Each person who makes a false statement as to the number of dairy cattle that was sold for slaughter or export under a contract under paragraph (3)(A) shall be subject, in addition to any amount due under paragraph (3)(A)(iv) or clause (iii) of this subparagraph, to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each head of cattle to which such statement applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under subparagraph (B) may obtain review of such penalty in an appropriate district court of the United States by filing a civil action in such court not later than thirty days after such penalty is imposed. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which the penalty is based. The findings of the Secretary may be set aside only if found to be unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review and enforce any penalty imposed under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The remedies provided in this paragraph shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, other remedies that may be available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The production and use of abundant supplies of high quality milk and dairy products are essential to the health and general welfare of the Nation: a dependable domestic source of supply of these foods in the form of high grade dairy herds and modern, sanitary dairy equipment is important to the national defense; and an economically sound dairy industry affects beneficially the economy of the country as a whole. It is the policy of Congress to assure a stabilized annual production of adequate supplies of milk and dairy products; to promote the increased use of these essential foods; to improve the domestic source of supply of milk and butterfat by encouraging dairy farmers to develop efficient production units consisting of high-grade, disease-free cattle and modern sanitary equipment; and to stabilize the economy of dairy farmers at a level which will provide a fair return for their labor and investment when compared with the cost of things that farmers buy.</p>
