<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans and purchases</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary shall make available to producers on a farm loans and purchases for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of wheat produced on the farm at such level as the Secretary determines will maintain the competitive relationship of wheat to other grains in domestic and export markets after taking into consideration the cost of producing wheat, supply and demand conditions, and world prices for wheat.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum loan and purchase level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), the loan and purchase level determined under paragraph (1) shall not be less than 85 percent of the simple average price received by producers of wheat, as determined by the Secretary, during the marketing years for the immediately preceding 5 crops of wheat, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period, except that the loan and purchase level for a crop determined under this paragraph may not be reduced by more than 5 percent from the level determined for the preceding crop.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustments to support level</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Stocks to use ratio</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary estimates for any marketing year that the ratio of ending stocks of wheat to total use for the marketing year will be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) equal to or greater than 30 percent, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop by an amount not to exceed 10 percent in any year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) less than 30 percent but not less than 15 percent, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop by an amount not to exceed 5 percent in any year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) less than 15 percent, the Secretary may not reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Report to Congress</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the Secretary adjusts the level of loans and purchases for wheat under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) certifying such adjustment as necessary to prevent the accumulation of stocks and to retain market share; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) containing a description of the need for such adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Effective date of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The adjustment shall become effective no earlier than 60 calendar days after the date of submission of the report to the Committees, except that in the case of the 1991 crop of wheat, the adjustment shall become effective on the date of the submission of the report.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Competitive position</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the Secretary determines, not later than 60 days prior to the beginning of a marketing year for a crop, that the effective loan rate established for such crop will not maintain a competitive market position for wheat, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the marketing year by an amount, in addition to any reduction under subparagraph (A), not to exceed 10 percent in any year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) No effect on future years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any reduction in the loan and purchase level for wheat under this paragraph shall not be considered in determining the loan and purchase level for wheat for subsequent years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Minimum loan rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the loan rate for wheat shall not be less than $2.44 per bushel, unless such rate would exceed 80 percent of the 5-year average market price determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Marketing loan provisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may permit a producer to repay a loan made under this subsection for a crop at a level (except as provided in subparagraph (C)) that is the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the loan level determined for the crop;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 70 percent of such level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if the loan level for a crop was reduced under paragraph (3), 70 percent of the loan level that would have been in effect but for the reduction under paragraph (3); or</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Alternative repayment rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of wheat, if the world market price for wheat (adjusted to United States quality and location) as determined by the Secretary, is less than the loan level determined for the crop, the Secretary may permit a producer to repay a loan made under this subsection for a crop at such level (not in excess of the loan level determined for the crop) as the Secretary determines will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) minimize potential loan forfeitures;</p>

Such projected payment rate for the crop shall be announced by the Secretary prior to the period during which wheat producers may agree to participate in the program for the crop.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adverse effect on agribusiness and other interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall implement this subparagraph in such a manner as to minimize the adverse effect on agribusiness and other agriculturally related economic interests within any county, State, or region. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Secretary is authorized to restrict the total quantity of wheat acreage that may be taken out of production under this subparagraph, taking into consideration the total quantity of acreage that has or will be removed from production under other price support, production adjustment, or conservation program activities. No restrictions on the quantity of acreage that may be taken out of production in accordance with this subparagraph in a crop year shall be imposed in the case of a county in which producers were eligible to receive disaster emergency loans under section 1961 of this title as a result of a disaster that occurred during the crop year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Crop acreage and payment yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The wheat crop acreage base and wheat farm program payment yield of the farm shall not be reduced due to the fact that a portion of the permitted wheat acreage of the farm was devoted to conserving uses (except as provided in subparagraph (F)) under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Other than as provided in clauses (i) through (iv), payments may not be made under this paragraph for any crop on a greater acreage than the acreage actually planted to wheat.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Conservation use acreage under other programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any acreage considered to be planted to wheat in accordance with clauses (i) and <!-- PDFPage:725 -->(iv) may not also be designated as conservation use acreage for the purpose of fulfilling any provisions under any acreage limitation or land diversion program requiring that the producers devote a specified acreage to conservation uses.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Exceptions to 0/85</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of each of the 1994 through 1997 crops of wheat, producers on a farm shall be eligible to receive deficiency payments as provided in clause (ii) if an acreage limitation program under subsection (e) of this section is in effect for the crop and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I)(aa) the producers have been determined by the Secretary (in accordance with section 1463(c) of this title) to be prevented from planting the crop or have incurred a reduced yield for the crop (due to a natural disaster); and</p>
