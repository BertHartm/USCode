<p class="statutory-body">Each warehouseman applying for a license to conduct a warehouse in accordance with this chapter shall, as a condition to the granting thereof, execute and file with the Secretary of Agriculture a good and sufficient bond to the United States to secure the faithful performance of his obligations as a warehouseman under the terms of this chapter and the rules and regulations prescribed hereunder, and of such additional obligations as a warehouseman as may be assumed by him under contracts with the respective depositors of agricultural products in such warehouse. Said bond shall be in such form and amount, shall have such surety or sureties, subject to service of process in suits on the bond within the State, District, or Territory in which the warehouse is located, and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture may prescribe to carry out the purposes of this chapter, and may, in the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture, include the requirements of fire and/or other insurance. Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture, or his designated representative, shall determine that a previously approved bond is, or for any cause has become, insufficient, he may require an additional bond or bonds to be given by the warehouseman concerned, conforming with the requirements of this section, and unless the same be given within the time fixed by a written demand therefor the license of such warehouseman may be suspended or revoked.</p>
