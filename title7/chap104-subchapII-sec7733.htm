<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to issue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall have the power to subpoena the attendance and testimony of any witness, the production of all evidence (including books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, and other tangible things that constitute or contain evidence), or to require the person to whom the subpoena is directed to permit the inspection of premises relating to the administration or enforcement of this chapter or any matter under investigation in connection with this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Location of production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The attendance of any witness and production of evidence relevant to the inquiry may be required from any place in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement of Subpoena</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of disobedience to a subpoena by any person, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction in which the investigation is conducted, or where the person resides, is found, transacts business, is licensed to do business, or is incorporated, in requiring the attendance and testimony of any witness, the production of evidence, or the inspection of premises. In case of a refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, a court may order the person to appear before the Secretary and give evidence concerning the matter in question, produce evidence, or permit the inspection of premises. Any failure to obey the court's order may be punished by the court as a contempt of the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Witnesses summoned by the Secretary shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in courts of the United States, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking the depositions shall be entitled to the same fees that are paid for similar services in the courts of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall publish procedures for the issuance of subpoenas under this section. Such procedures shall include a requirement that subpoenas be reviewed for legal sufficiency and signed by the Secretary. If the authority to sign a subpoena is delegated to an agency other than the Office of Administrative Law Judges, the agency receiving the delegation shall seek review for legal sufficiency outside that agency.</p>
