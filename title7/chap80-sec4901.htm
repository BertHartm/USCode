<p class="statutory-body">(a) Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the per capita consumption of watermelons in the United States has declined steadily in recent years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) watermelons are an important cash crop to many farmers in the United States and are an economical, enjoyable, and healthful food for consumers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) approximately 2,607,600,000 pounds of watermelons with a farm value of $158,923,000 were produced in 1981 in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) watermelons move in the channels of interstate commerce, and watermelons that do not move in such channels directly affect interstate commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and the establishment of new or improved markets and uses for watermelons are vital to the welfare of watermelon growers and those concerned with marketing, using, handling, and importing watermelons, as well as the general economic welfare of the Nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the development and implementation of coordinated programs of research, development, advertising, and promotion are necessary to maintain and expand existing markets and establish new or improved markets and uses for watermelons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is declared to be the policy of Congress that it is essential in the public interest, through the exercise of the powers provided herein, to authorize the establishment of an orderly procedure for the development, financing (through adequate assessments on watermelons harvested in the United States, or imported into the United States, for commercial use), and carrying out of an effective, continuous, and coordinated program of research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's competitive position in the marketplace, and establish, maintain, and expand domestic and foreign markets for watermelons. The purpose of this chapter is to so authorize the establishment of such procedure and the development, financing, and carrying out of such program. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to dictate quality standards nor provide for the control of production or otherwise limit the right of individual watermelon producers to produce watermelons.</p>
