<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized and empowered to make advances, without regard to any loan or total indebtedness limitation, to preserve and protect the security for or the lien or priority of the lien securing any loan or other indebtedness owing to, insured by, or acquired by the Secretary under this chapter or under any other programs administered by the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration; to bid for and purchase at any execution, foreclosure, or other sale or otherwise to acquire property upon which the United States has a lien by reason of a judgment or execution arising from, or which is pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, attached, or levied upon to secure the payment of, any such indebtedness whether or not such property is subject to other liens, to accept title to any property so purchased or acquired; and to sell, manage, or otherwise dispose of such property as hereinafter provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, real property administered under the provisions of this chapter may be operated or leased by the Secretary for such period or periods as the Secretary may deem necessary to protect the Government's investment therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary may determine whether real property administered under this chapter is suitable for disposition to persons eligible for assistance under the provisions of any law administered by the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration. The County Committee shall classify or reclassify real property (including real property administered by the Secretary on January 6, 1988) that is farmland, as being suitable for farming operation for such disposition unless the property, including property subdivided in accordance with subsection (e)(5) of this section, cannot be used to meet any of the purposes of section 1923 of this title (including being used as a start-up or add-on parcel of farmland). Any property which the Secretary determines to be suitable for such purposes shall, whenever practicable, be sold by the Secretary as expeditiously as possible to such eligible persons in a manner consistent with such provisions. Real property which is not determined suitable for sale to such eligible persons or which has not been purchased by such persons within a period of 12 months from the date first published under paragraph (2)(D), shall be (A) sold by the Secretary after public notice at public sale and, if no acceptable bid is received then by negotiated sale, at the best price obtainable for cash or on <!-- PDFPage:984 -->secured credit without regard to the laws governing the disposition of excess or surplus property of the United States or (B) leased to persons eligible for assistance under the provisions of any law administered by the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration under an annual lease or a lease with an option to purchase, with a preference for sale. The terms of such sale shall require an initial downpayment and the remainder of the sales price payable in installments with interest on unpaid balance at the rate determined by the Secretary, but not in any event at rates and terms more favorable than those legally permissible for eligible borrowers. Any conveyances under this section shall include all of the interest of the United States, including mineral rights, other than easements acquired under section 1997 of this title.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) select from among qualified applicants the applicant who has the greatest need for farm income and best meets the criteria for eligibility to receive loans under subchapter I of this chapter, except that if the committee determines that two or more applicants meet the loan eligibility criteria, the committee shall select between the qualified applicants on a random basis; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In leasing such land, the Secretary shall determine if the lessee has financial resources, and farm management skills and experience, that the Secretary determines are sufficient to assure a reasonable prospect of success in the proposed farming operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) To the extent the Secretary may lease or operate real property under this subsection, the Secretary shall, if the Secretary determines to administer such property through management contracts, offer the contracts on a competitive bid basis, giving preference to persons who will live in, and own and operate qualified small businesses in, the area where the property is located.</p>
