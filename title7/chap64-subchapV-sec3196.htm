<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of annual priority lists for allocation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to establish a rational allocation of funds appropriated under this section, the Sec<!-- PDFPage:1275 -->retary shall establish annually priority lists of animal health and disease problems of national or regional significance. Such lists shall be prepared after consultation with the Joint Council, the Advisory Board, and the Board. Any recommendations made in connection with such consultation shall not be controlling on the Secretary's determination of priorities. In establishing such priorities, the Secretary, the Joint Council, the Advisory Board, and the Board shall consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any health or disease problem which causes or may cause significant economic losses to any part of the livestock production industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether current scientific knowledge necessary to prevent, cure, or abate such a health or disease problem is adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether the status of scientific research is such that accomplishments may be anticipated through the application of scientific effort to such health or disease problem.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment of priorities for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Without regard to any consultation under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall, to the extent feasible, award grants to eligible institutions on the basis of the priorities assigned through a peer review system. Grantees shall be selected on a competitive basis in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary may establish.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distribution of multiyear grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of multiyear grants, the Secretary shall distribute funds to grant recipients on a schedule which is reasonably related to the timetable required for the orderly conduct of the research project involved.</p>
