Any person for good cause shown may, on application, be allowed by the Secretary to intervene in such proceeding, and appear in person or by counsel. At any time prior to the close of the hearing, the Secretary may amend the complaint; but in case of any amendment adding new charges, the hearing shall, on the request of the live poultry dealer, be adjourned for a period not exceeding 15 days.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report on findings of fact by Secretary; cease and desist order; assessment of civil penalty; action by Attorney General upon live poultry dealer's failure to pay penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after such hearing, the Secretary finds that the live poultry dealer has violated, or is violating, any provisions of section 197 of this title or section 228b&ndash;1 of this title covered by the charges, he shall make a report in writing in which he shall state his findings as to the facts, and shall issue and cause to be served on the live poultry dealer an order requiring such live poultry dealer to cease and desist from continuing such violation. The testimony taken at the hearing shall be reduced to writing and filed in the records of the Department of Agriculture. The Secretary may also assess a civil penalty of not more than $20,000 for each such violation. In determining the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed under this section, the Secretary shall consider the gravity of the offense, the size of the business involved, and the effect of the penalty on the person's ability to continue in business: <em>Provided, however</em>, That in no event can the penalty assessed by the Secretary take priority over or impede the ability of the live poultry dealer to pay any unpaid cash seller or poultry grower. If, after the lapse of the period allowed for appeal or after the affirmance of such penalty, the person against whom the civil penalty is assessed fails to pay such penalty, the Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney General, who may recover such penalty by an action in the appropriate District Court of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Finality of order unless appeal to court of appeals; time limit; bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order made under section 228b&ndash;2 of this title shall be final and conclusive unless within 30 days after service the live poultry dealer appeals to the court of appeals for the circuit in <!-- PDFPage:228 -->which he has his principal place of business, by filing with the clerk of such court a written petition praying that the Secretary's order be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition, together with a bond in such sum as the court may determine, conditioned that such live poultry dealer will pay the costs of the proceedings if the court so directs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification of appeal to Secretary; filing of record with court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk of the court shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be delivered to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall thereupon file in the court the record in such proceedings, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. If before such record is filed the Secretary amends or sets aside his report or order, in whole or in part, the petitioner may amend the petition within such time as the court may determine, on notice to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Issuance of temporary injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time after such petition is filed, the court, on application of the Secretary, may issue a temporary injunction, restraining, to the extent it deems proper, the live poultry dealer and his officers, directors, agents, and employees, from violating any of the provisions of the order pending the final determination of the appeal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Evidence in record as evidence in case; expedited proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The evidence so taken or admitted, and filed as aforesaid as a part of the record, shall be considered by the court as the evidence in the case. The proceedings in such cases in the court of appeals shall be made a preferred cause and shall be expedited in every way.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Action by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The court may affirm, modify, or set aside the order of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Taking of additional evidence; modified or additional findings by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the court determines that the just and proper disposition of the case requires the taking of additional evidence, the court shall order the hearing to be reopened for the taking of such evidence, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem proper. The Secretary may modify his findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he shall file such modified or new findings and his recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of his order, with the return of such additional evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Affirmance or modification of order as injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the court of appeals affirms or modifies the order of the Secretary, its decree shall operate as an injunction to restrain the live poultry dealer, and his officers, directors, agents, and employees from violating the provisions of such order or such order as modified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Exclusive jurisdiction of court of appeals; finality of decree; appeal to Supreme Court; stay of decree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The court of appeals shall have jurisdiction which upon the filing of the record with it shall be exclusive, to review, and to affirm, set aside, or modify, such orders of the Secretary, and the decree of such court shall be final except that it shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28, if such writ is duly applied for within 60 days after entry of the decree. The issue of such writ shall not operate as a stay of the decree of the court of appeals, insofar as such decree operates as an injunction, unless so ordered by the Supreme Court.</p>
