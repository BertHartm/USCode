<p class="statutory-body">As used in this chapter:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Communication satellite ground station complex</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;communication satellite ground station complex&rdquo; includes transmitters, receivers, and communications antennas at the Earth station site together with the interconnecting terrestrial transmission facilities (cables, line, or microwave facilities) and modulating and demodulating equipment necessary for processing traffic received from the terrestrial distribution system prior to transmission via satellite and the traffic received <!-- PDFPage:441 -->from the satellite prior to transfer to terrestrial distribution systems.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Comprehensive rural telecommunications plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;comprehensive rural telecommunications plan&rdquo; means a plan submitted by an applicant for a grant under this chapter. Each such plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a detailed explanation of the proposed rural telecommunications system, how such system is to be funded, and a description of the intended uses for grants received from the Secretary under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an explanation of the manner in which such plan complies with any requirements imposed by the Secretary under this chapter or otherwise imposed under section 950aaa&ndash;3 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a listing of the proposed purchases or leases of telecommunications terminal equipment, telecommunications transmission facilities, data terminal equipment, interactive video equipment, computer hardware and software systems, and components that process data for transmission via telecommunications, computer network components, communication satellite ground station equipment, or any other elements of the telecommunications system designed to further the purposes of this chapter, that the applicant intends to build or fund using the grant funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) an explanation of the special financial or other needs of the affected rural communities and of the applicants for such grant assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) an analysis of the relative costs and benefits of proposals for leasing or purchasing of facilities, equipment, components, hardware and software, or other items; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a description of the consultations with the appropriate local telephone exchange carrier or carriers and with a wide variety of additional telecommunications service providers (including other interexchange carriers, cable television operators, enhanced service providers, providers of satellite services and telecommunications equipment manufacturers and distributors), and the anticipated role of such providers in the proposed telecommunications system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Computer networks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;computer networks&rdquo; refers to computer hardware and software, terminals, signal conversion equipment including both modulators and demodulators, or related devices, used to communicate with other computers to process and exchange data through a telecommunication network in which signals are generated, modified, or prepared for transmission, or received, via telecommunications terminal equipment and telecommunications transmission facilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Data terminal equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;data terminal equipment&rdquo; refers to equipment that converts user information into data signals for transmission, or reconverts the received data signals into user information, and is normally found on the terminal of a circuit and on the premises of the end user.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) End user</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;end user&rdquo; means rural community facilities or persons associated with those facilities who participate in the programs established under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Fiber-optic cable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;fiber-optic cable&rdquo; means a bundle of optical transmission elements or waveguides usually consisting of a fiber core and fiber cladding that can guide a lightwave and that are incorporated into an assembly of materials that provide tensile strength and external protection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Interactive video equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;interactive video equipment&rdquo; refers to equipment used to produce and prepare for transmission audio and visual signals from at least two distant locations such that individuals at such locations can verbally and visually communicate with each other, and such equipment includes monitors, other display devices, cameras or other recording devices, audio pickup devices, and other related equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; means the Secretary of Agriculture.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Telecommunications transmission facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;telecommunications transmission facilities&rdquo; refers to those facilities that transmit, receive, or carry data between the telecommunications terminal equipment at each end of a telecommunications circuit or path. Such facilities include microwave antennae, relay stations and towers, other telecommunications antennae, fiber-optic cables and repeaters, coaxial cables, communication satellite ground station complexes, copper cable electronic equipment associated with telecommunications transmissions, and similar items as defined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Telecommunications terminal equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;telecommunications terminal equipment&rdquo; refers to the assembly of telecommunications equipment at the end of a circuit, normally located on the premises of the end user, that interfaces with telecommunications transmission facilities, and that is used to modify, convert, encode, or otherwise prepare signals to be transmitted via such telecommunications facilities, or that is used to modify, reconvert or carry signals received from such facilities, the purpose of which is to accomplish the goal for which the circuit was established.</p>
