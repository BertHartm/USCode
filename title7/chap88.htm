<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary shall implement this section in such a manner as to minimize any adverse economic effect on the agribusinesses and other agriculturally related economic interests within any county, State, or region that may result from a decrease of harvested acres due to the operation of this section. In carrying out this section, the Secretary may restrict the total amount of crop acreage that may be removed from production, taking into consideration the total amount of crop acreage that has, or will be, removed from production under other price support, production adjustment, or conservation program activities.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Maximize conservation goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall, to the greatest extent practicable, permit producers on a farm that desire to participate in the program authorized under this section to enroll acreage adequate to maximize conservation goals on such farm and ensure economic effectiveness of the program in each individual application.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Displacement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall not approve any plan that will result in the involuntary displacement of farm tenants or lessees by landowners through the removal of substantial portions of the farm from production of a commodity. In the case of any tenant or lessee who has rented or leased the farm (with or without a written option for annual renewal or periodic renewals) for a period of two or more of the immediately preceding years, the Secretary shall consider the refusal by a landlord, without reasonable cause other than simply for the purpose of enrollment in the program, to renew such rental or lease as an involuntary displacement in the absence of a written consent to such nonrenewal by the tenant or lessee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall certify compliance by producers with the terms and conditions of the plans.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Base and yield protection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall not, except as provided in paragraph (6), reduce crop acreage bases, or farm program payment yields, as a result of the planting of a resource-conserving crop as part of a resource-conserving crop rotation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Resource-conserving crops on reduced acreage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of title I of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.], acreage devoted to resource-conserving crops as part of a resource-conserving crop rotation under this program may also be designated as conservation use acreage for the purpose of fulfilling any provisions under any acreage limitation or land diversion program and up to 50 percent of the acreage so designated shall be without restrictions on haying and grazing, except as provided in paragraph (5)(B), except that such acreage <!-- PDFPage:1414 -->that is devoted to perennial cover on which cost-share assistance for the establishment of the perennial cover has been provided, shall not be credited towards the producer's resource-conserving crop requirement under a contract under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Barley, oats, and wheat</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, barley, oats, or wheat planted as part of a resource-conserving crop on reduced acreage may not be harvested in kernel form.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payment acres</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Secretary shall not reduce farm program payments of participants in this program as a result of the planting a resource-conserving crop as part of a resource-conserving crop rotation on payment acres.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Haying and grazing restriction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall not make any program payments to a producer who is otherwise eligible to receive with respect to acreage enrolled in the program if such producer hays or grazes such acreage (excluding acreage designated as conservation use acreage) during the 5-month period in each State during which haying and grazing of conserving use acres is not allowed under the provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], or, if the crop planted on such acreage includes a small grain, before the producer harvests the small grain crop in kernel form.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation on permitted haying and grazing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Secretary determines that implementation of this section will result in a significant adverse economic impact on hay or livestock prices in a particular geographic area, the Secretary may limit the quantity of hay that can be harvested or grazed from that area. Such limit may include restrictions on the number of times that hay may be harvested or grazed from the acres per year, the timing of such harvesting and grazing, or the number of years that such land may remain in the same hay stand, or a prohibition on the harvesting or grazing of hay from acres on which a small grain was not originally interplanted with the hay crop and harvested for grain.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Base acre adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, only for the purpose of establishing a producer's crop acreage base under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], may make such adjustments as the Secretary determines to be fair and equitable to reflect resource-conserving crop rotation practices that were maintained by producers prior to participation in the program and to reflect such other factors as the Secretary determines should be considered, except that the total of such adjustments in any year shall not exceed the total farm program savings in the same year that would result from the implementation of plans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Payment acreage limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No producers enrolled in a resource-conserving crop rotation shall be eligible to receive payments under farm programs for wheat, feed grains, cotton, or rice under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.] on acreage equal to the average number of traditionally underplanted acres for the three years prior to enrolling in this program.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Traditionally underplanted acreage&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), for the purposes of this paragraph the term &ldquo;traditionally underplanted acreage&rdquo; means the difference in a particular year between the acreage that is part of a producer's crop acreage base that is not planted to the program crop and the part of the crop acreage base subject to an acreage limitation program or required to be set aside, but only to the extent that such number exceeds the number of acres resulting from the reduction in payment acres under an amendment made by section 1101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&ndash;508; 104 Stat. 1388&ndash;1). In no case shall such acreage be less than zero.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a producer participating in a particular year in a program authorized under section 101B(c)(1)(D), 103B(c)(1)(D), 105B(c)(1)(E), or 107B(c)(1)(E) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1441&ndash;2(c)(1)(D), 1444&ndash;2(c)(1)(D), 1444f(c)(1)(E), or 1445b&ndash;3a(c)(1)(E)], the term &ldquo;traditionally underplanted acreage&rdquo; means 8 percent of the producer's permitted acreage for such year.</p>
