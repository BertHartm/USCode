<p class="statutory-body">It is declared to be the policy of Congress, in order to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of <!-- PDFPage:1020 -->food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a food stamp program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Household income for those households that, by contract for other than an hourly or piecework basis or by self-employment, derive their annual income in a period of time shorter than one year shall be calculated by averaging such income over a twelve-month period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, household income resulting from the self-employment of a member in a farming operation, who derives income from such farming operation and who has irregular expenses to produce such income, may, at the option of the household, be calculated by averaging such income and expenses over a 12-month period. Notwithstanding the first sentence, if the averaged amount does not accurately reflect the household's actual monthly circumstances because the household has experienced a substantial increase or decrease in busi<!-- PDFPage:1036 -->ness earnings, the State agency shall calculate the self-employment income based on anticipated earnings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Household income for those households that receive nonexcluded income of the type described in subsection (d)(3) of this section shall be calculated by averaging such income over the period for which it is received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), households shall have their incomes calculated on a prospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(A), or, at the option of the State agency, on a retrospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of the first month, or at the option of the State, the first and second months, during a continuous period in which a household is certified, the State agency shall determine eligibility and the amount of benefits on the basis of the household's income and other relevant circumstances in such first or second month.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Calculation of household income on a prospective basis is the calculation of income on the basis of the income reasonably anticipated to be received by the household during the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined. Such calculation shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary which shall provide for taking into account both the income reasonably anticipated to be received by the household during the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined and the income received by the household during the preceding thirty days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Calculation of household income on a retrospective basis is the calculation of income for the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined on the basis of income received in a previous period. Such calculation shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary which may provide for the determination of eligibility on a prospective basis in some or all cases in which benefits are calculated under this paragraph. Such regulations shall provide for supplementing the initial allotments of newly applying households in those cases in which the determination of income under this paragraph causes serious hardship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In promulgating regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order to assure that, to the extent feasible and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], the income of households receiving benefits under this chapter and title IV&ndash;A of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] is calculated on a comparable basis under this chapter and the Social Security Act. The Secretary is authorized, upon the request of a State agency, to waive any of the provisions of this subsection (except the provisions of paragraph (2)(A)) to the extent necessary to permit the State agency to calculate income for purposes of this chapter on the same basis that income is calculated under title IV&ndash;A of the Social Security Act in that State.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Excluded vehicles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A vehicle (and any other property, real or personal, to the extent the property is directly related to the maintenance or use of the vehicle) shall not be included in financial resources under this paragraph if the vehicle is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) used to produce earned income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) necessary for the transportation of a physically disabled household member; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) depended on by a household to carry fuel for heating or water for home use and provides the primary source of fuel or water, respectively, for the household.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Alternative vehicle allowance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the vehicle allowance standards that a State agency uses to determine eligibility for assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) would result in a lower attribution of resources to certain households than under subparagraph (B)(iv), in lieu of applying subparagraph (B)(iv), the State agency may elect to apply the State vehicle allowance standards to all households that would incur a lower attribution of resources under the State vehicle allowance standards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1037 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of a burial plot for each member of a household and nonliquid resources necessary to allow the household to carry out a plan for self-sufficiency approved by the State agency that constitutes adequate participation in an employment and training program under section 2015(d) of this title. The Secretary shall also exclude from financial resources any earned income tax credits received by any member of the household for a period of 12 months from receipt if such member was participating in the food stamp program at the time the credits were received and participated in such program continuously during the 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of farm property (including land, equipment, and supplies) that is essential to the self-employment of a household member in a farming operation, the Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of such property until the expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date such member ceases to be self-employed in farming.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall promulgate rules by which State agencies shall develop standards for identifying kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, the household is unlikely to be able to sell for any significant return because the household's interest is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's interest would be relatively great. Resources so identified shall be excluded as inaccessible resources. A resource shall be so identified if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. The Secretary shall not require the State agency to require verification of the value of a resource to be excluded under this paragraph unless the State agency determines that the information provided by the household is questionable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Temporary emergency standards of eligibility; Food Stamp Disaster Task Force; direct assistance to State and local officials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, after consultation with the official empowered to exercise the authority provided for by sections 5170a and 5192 of title 42, establish temporary emergency standards of eligibility for the duration of the emergency for households who are victims of a disaster which disrupts commercial channels of food distribution, if such households are in need of temporary food assistance and if commercial channels of food distribution have again become available to meet the temporary food needs of such households. Such standards as are prescribed for individual emergencies may be promulgated without regard to section 2013(c) of this title or the procedures set forth in section 553 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish a Food Stamp Disaster Task Force to assist States in implementing and operating the disaster program and the regular food stamp program in the disaster area; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall provide, by regulation, for emergency allotments to eligible households to replace food destroyed in a disaster. The regulations shall provide for replacement of the value of food actually lost up to a limit approved by the Secretary not greater than the applicable maximum monthly allotment for the household size.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall adjust reporting and other application requirements to be consistent with what is practicable under actual conditions in the affected area. In making this adjustment, the Secretary shall consider the availability of the State agency's offices and personnel and any damage to or disruption of transportation and communication facilities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Benefits not deemed income or resources for certain purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The value of benefits that may be provided under this chapter, whether through coupons, access devices, or otherwise&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2017_1_target" name="2017_1">1</a></sup> shall not be considered income or resources for any purpose under any Federal, State, or local laws, including, but not limited to, laws relating to taxation, welfare, and public assistance programs, and no participating State or political subdivision thereof shall decrease any assistance otherwise provided an individual or individuals because of the receipt of benefits under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) First month benefits prorated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The value of the allotment issued to any eligible household for the initial month or other initial period for which an allotment is issued shall have a value which bears the same ratio to the value of the allotment for a full month or other initial period for which the allotment is issued as the number of days (from the date of application) remaining in the month or other initial period for which the allotment is issued bears to the total number of days in the month or other initial period for which the allotment is <!-- PDFPage:1068 -->issued, except that no allotment may be issued to a household for the initial month or period if the value of the allotment which such household would otherwise be eligible to receive under this subsection is less than $10. Households shall receive full months&rsquo; allotments for all months within a certification period, except as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph with respect to an initial month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;initial month&rdquo; means (A) the first month for which an allotment is issued to a household, (B) the first month for which an allotment is issued to a household following any period in which such household was not participating in the food stamp program under this chapter after the expiration of a certification period or after the termination of the certification of a household, during a certification period, when the household ceased to be eligible after notice and an opportunity for a hearing under section 2020(e)(10) of this title, and (C) in the case of a migrant or seasonal farmworker household, the first month for which allotment is issued to a household that applies following any period of more than 30 days in which such household was not participating in the food stamp program after previous participation in such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Optional combined allotment for expedited households</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State agency may provide to an eligible household applying after the 15th day of a month, in lieu of the initial allotment of the household and the regular allotment of the household for the following month, an allotment that is equal to the total amount of the initial allotment and the first regular allotment. The allotment shall be provided in accordance with section 2020(e)(3) of this title in the case of a household that is not entitled to expedited service and in accordance with paragraphs (3) and (9) of section 2020(e) of this title in the case of a household that is entitled to expedited service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction of public assistance benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the benefits of a household are reduced under a Federal, State, or local law relating to a means-tested public assistance program for the failure of a member of the household to perform an action required under the law or program, for the duration of the reduction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the household may not receive an increased allotment as the result of a decrease in the income of the household to the extent that the decrease is the result of the reduction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State agency may reduce the allotment of the household by not more than 25 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rules and procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the allotment of a household is reduced under this subsection for a failure to perform an action required under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the State agency may use the rules and procedures that apply under part A of title IV of the Act to reduce the allotment under the food stamp program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allotments for households residing in centers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the center as an authorized representative of the individual for a period that is less than 1 month; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applications; qualifications; certificate of approval; periodic reauthorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations issued pursuant to this chapter shall provide for the submission of applications for approval by retail food stores and wholesale food concerns which desire to be authorized to accept and redeem coupons under the food stamp program and for the approval of those applicants whose participation will effectuate the purposes of the food stamp program. In determining the qualifications of applicants, there shall be considered among such other factors as may be appropriate, the following: (A) the nature and extent of the food business conducted by the applicant; (B) the volume of coupon business which may reasonably be expected to be conducted by the applicant food store or wholesale food concern; and (C) the business integrity and reputation of the applicant. Approval of an applicant shall be evidenced by the issuance to such applicant of a nontransferable certificate of approval. No retail food store or wholesale food concern of a type determined by the Secretary, based on factors that include size, location, and type of items sold, shall be approved to be authorized or reauthorized for participation in the food stamp program unless an authorized employee of the Department of Agriculture, a designee of the Secretary, or, if practicable, an official of the State or local government designated by the Secretary has visited the store or concern for the purpose of determining whether the store or concern should be approved or reauthorized, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall issue regulations providing for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the periodic reauthorization of retail food stores and wholesale food concerns; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) periodic notice to participating retail food stores and wholesale food concerns of the definitions of &ldquo;retail food store&rdquo;, &ldquo;staple foods&rdquo;, &ldquo;eligible foods&rdquo;, and &ldquo;perishable foods&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effective and efficient operation of program; effect of disqualification; posting of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No wholesale food concern may be authorized to accept and redeem coupons unless the Secretary determines that its participation is required for the effective and efficient operation of the food stamp program. No co-located wholesale-retail food concern may be authorized to accept and redeem coupons as a retail food store, unless (A) the concern does a substantial level of retail food business, or (B) the Secretary determines that failure to authorize such a food concern as a retail food store would cause hardship to food stamp households. In addition, no firm may be authorized to accept and redeem coupons as both a retail food store and as a wholesale food concern at the same time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A buyer or transferee (other than a bona fide buyer or transferee) of a retail food store or wholesale food concern that has been disqualified under section 2021(a) of this title may not accept or redeem coupons until the Secretary receives full payment of any penalty imposed on such store or concern.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Information submitted by applicants; safeguards; disclosure to and use by State agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Regulations issued pursuant to this chapter shall require an applicant retail food store or wholesale food concern to submit information, which may include relevant income and sales tax filing documents, which will permit a determination to be made as to whether such applicant qualifies, or continues to qualify, for approval under the provisions of this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter. The regulations may require retail food stores and wholesale food concerns to provide written authorization for the Secretary to verify all relevant tax filings with appropriate agencies and to obtain corroborating documentation from other sources so that the accuracy of information provided by the stores and concerns may be verified. Regulations issued pursuant to this chapter shall provide for safeguards which limit the use or disclosure of information obtained under the authority granted by this subsection to purposes directly connected with administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter, except that such information may be disclosed to and used by Federal law enforcement and investigative agencies and law enforcement and investigative agencies of a State government for the purposes of administering or enforcing this chapter or any other Federal or State law and the regulations issued under this chapter or such law, and State agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, authorized under section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 [42 U.S.C. 1786], for purposes of administering the provisions of that Act [42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.] and the regulations issued under that Act. Any person who publishes, divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner or to any extent not authorized by Federal law (including a regulation) any information obtained under this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both. The regulations shall establish the criteria to be used by the Secretary to determine whether the information is needed. The regulations shall not prohibit the audit and examination of such information by the Comptroller General of the United States authorized by any other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Hearing upon failure of applicant to receive approval; waiting period for new application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any retail food store or wholesale food concern which has failed upon application to re<!-- PDFPage:1071 -->ceive approval to participate in the food stamp program may obtain a hearing on such refusal as provided in section 2023 of this title. A retail food store or wholesale food concern that is denied approval to accept and redeem coupons because the store or concern does not meet criteria for approval established by the Secretary may not, for at least 6 months, submit a new application to participate in the program. The Secretary may establish a longer time period under the preceding sentence, including permanent disqualification, that reflects the severity of the basis of the denial.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting of abuses by public</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Approved retail food stores shall display a sign providing information on how persons may report abuses they have observed in the operation of the food stamp program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on participation of house-to-house trade routes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In those areas in which the Secretary, in consultation with the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture, finds evidence that the operation of house-to-house trade routes damages the program's integrity, the Secretary shall limit the participation of house-to-house trade routes to those routes that are reasonably necessary to provide adequate access to households.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State responsibility; records, inspection, and audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State agency of each participating State shall assume responsibility for the certification of applicant households and for the issuance of coupons and the control and accountability thereof. There shall be kept such records as may be necessary to ascertain whether the program is being conducted in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter. Such records shall be available for inspection and audit at any reasonable time and shall be preserved for such period of time, not less than three years, as may be specified in the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Correction of improper denials and underissuances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a State agency learns, through its own reviews under section 2025 of this title or other reviews, or through other sources, that it has improperly denied, terminated, or underissued <!-- PDFPage:1074 -->benefits to an eligible household, the State agency shall promptly restore any improperly denied benefits to the extent required by subsection (e)(11) of this section and section 2023(b) of this title, and shall take other steps to prevent a recurrence of such errors where such error was caused by the application of State agency practices, rules or procedures inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter or with regulations or policies of the Secretary issued under the authority of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Discrimination prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the certification of applicant households for the food stamp program, there shall be no discrimination by reason of race, sex, religious creed, national origin, or political beliefs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The State agency (as defined in section 2012(n)(1) of this title) of each State desiring to participate in the food stamp program shall submit for approval a plan of operation specifying the manner in which such program will be conducted within the State in every political subdivision. The Secretary may not, as a part of the approval process for a plan of operation, require a State to submit for prior approval by the Secretary the State agency instructions to staff, interpretations of existing policy, State agency methods of administration, forms used by the State agency, or any materials, documents, memoranda, bulletins, or other matter, unless the State determines that the materials, documents, memoranda, bulletins, or other matter alter or amend the State plan of operation or conflict with the rights and levels of benefits to which a household is entitled. In the case of all or part of an Indian reservation, the State agency as defined in section 2012(n)(1) of this title shall be responsible for conducting such program on such reservation unless the Secretary determines that the State agency (as defined in section 2012(n)(1) of this title) is failing, subsequent to August 31, 1964, properly to administer such program on such reservation in accordance with the purposes of this chapter and further determines that the State agency as defined in section 2012(n)(2) of this title is capable of effectively and efficiently conducting such program, in light of the distance of the reservation from State agency-operated certification and issuance centers, the previous experience of such tribal organization in the operation of programs authorized under the Indian Self-Determination Act (25 U.S.C. 450) and similar Acts of Congress, the tribal organization's management and fiscal capabilities, and the adequacy of measures taken by the tribal organization to ensure that there shall be no discrimination in the operation of the program on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin, in which event such State agency shall be responsible for conducting such program and submitting for approval a plan of operation specifying the manner in which such program will be conducted. The Secretary, upon the request of a tribal organization, shall provide the designees of such organization with appropriate training and technical assistance to enable them to qualify as expeditiously as possible as a State agency pursuant to section 2012(n)(2) of this title. A State agency, as defined in section 2012(n)(1) of this title, before it submits its plan of operation to the Secretary for the administration of the food stamp program on all or part of an Indian reservation, shall consult in good faith with the tribal organization about that portion of the State's plan of operation pertaining to the implementation of the program for members of the tribe, and shall implement the program in a manner that is responsive to the needs of the Indians on the reservation as determined by ongoing consultation with the tribal organization.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disqualification or civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any approved retail food store or wholesale food concern may be disqualified for a specified period of time from further participation in the food stamp program, or subjected to a civil money penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation <!-- PDFPage:1086 -->if the Secretary determines that its disqualification would cause hardship to food stamp households, on a finding, made as specified in the regulations, that such store or concern has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter. Regulations issued pursuant to this chapter shall provide criteria for the finding of a violation and the suspension or disqualification of a retail food store or wholesale food concern on the basis of evidence that may include facts established through on-site investigations, inconsistent redemption data, or evidence obtained through a transaction report under an electronic benefit transfer system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Period of disqualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Disqualification under subsection (a) of this section shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for a reasonable period of time, of no less than six months nor more than five years, upon the first occasion of disqualification;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for a reasonable period of time, of no less than twelve months nor more than ten years, upon the second occasion of disqualification;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) permanent upon&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the third occasion of disqualification;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the first occasion or any subsequent occasion of a disqualification based on the purchase of coupons or trafficking in coupons or authorization cards by a retail food store or wholesale food concern, except that the Secretary shall have the discretion to impose a civil money penalty of up to $20,000 for each violation (except that the amount of civil money penalties imposed for violations occurring during a single investigation may not exceed $40,000) in lieu of disqualification under this subparagraph, for such purchase of coupons or trafficking in coupons or cards that constitutes a violation of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter, if the Secretary determines that there is substantial evidence that such store or food concern had an effective policy and program in effect to prevent violations of the chapter and the regulations, including evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the ownership of the store or food concern was not aware of, did not approve of, did not benefit from, and was not involved in the conduct of the violation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) the management of the store or food concern was not aware of, did not approve of, did not benefit from, and was not involved in the conduct of the violation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the management was aware of, approved of, benefited from, or was involved in the conduct of no more than 1 previous violation by the store or food concern; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a finding of the sale of firearms, ammunition, explosives, or controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of title 21) for coupons, except that the Secretary shall have the discretion to impose a civil money penalty of up to $20,000 for each violation (except that the amount of civil money penalties imposed for violations occurring during a single investigation may not exceed $40,000) in lieu of disqualification under this subparagraph if the Secretary determines that there is substantial evidence (including evidence that neither the ownership nor management of the store or food concern was aware of, approved, benefited from, or was involved in the conduct or approval of the violation) that the store or food concern had an effective policy and program in effect to prevent violations of this chapter; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for a reasonable period of time to be determined by the Secretary, including permanent disqualification, on the knowing submission of an application for the approval or reauthorization to accept and redeem coupons that contains false information about a substantive matter that was a part of the application.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The action of disqualification or the imposition of a civil money penalty shall be subject to review as provided in section 2023 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As a condition of authorization to accept and redeem coupons, the Secretary may require a retail food store or wholesale food concern which has been disqualified or subjected to a civil penalty pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to furnish a bond to cover the value of coupons which such store or concern may in the future accept and redeem in violation of this chapter. The Secretary shall, by regulation, prescribe the amount, terms, and conditions of such bond. If the Secretary finds that such store or concern has accepted and redeemed coupons in violation of this chapter after furnishing such bond, such store or concern shall forfeit to the Secretary an amount of such bond which is equal to the value of coupons accepted and redeemed by such store or concern in violation of this chapter. Such store or concern may obtain a hearing on such forfeiture pursuant to section 2023 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfer of ownership; penalty in lieu of disqualification period; fines for acceptance of loose coupons; judicial action to recover penalty or fine</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the event any retail food store or wholesale food concern that has been disqualified under subsection (a) of this section is sold or the ownership thereof is otherwise transferred to a purchaser or transferee, the person or persons who sell or otherwise transfer ownership of the retail food store or wholesale food concern shall be subjected to a civil money penalty in an amount established by the Secretary through regulations to reflect that portion of the disqualification period that has not yet expired. If the retail food store or wholesale food concern has been disqualified permanently, the civil money penalty shall be double the penalty for a ten-year disqualification period, as calculated under regulations issued by the Secretary. The disqualification period imposed under subsection (b) of this section shall continue in effect as to the person or persons who sell or otherwise transfer ownership of the retail food store or wholesale food concern notwithstanding the imposition of a civil money penalty under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At any time after a civil money penalty imposed under paragraph (1) has become final under the provisions of section 2023(a) of this <!-- PDFPage:1087 -->title, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action against the person or persons subject to the penalty in a district court of the United States for any district in which such person or persons are found, reside, or transact business to collect the penalty and such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide such action. In such action, the validity and amount of such penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may impose a fine against any retail food store or wholesale food concern that accepts food coupons that are not accompanied by the corresponding book cover, other than the denomination of coupons used for making change as specified in regulations issued under this chapter. The amount of any such fine shall be established by the Secretary and may be assessed and collected in accordance with regulations issued under this chapter separately or in combination with any fiscal claim established by the Secretary. The Attorney General of the United States may institute judicial action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the store or concern to collect the fine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Fines for unauthorized third parties that accept food stamps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may impose a fine against any person not approved by the Secretary to accept and redeem food coupons who violates any provision of this chapter or a regulation issued under this chapter, including violations concerning the acceptance of food coupons. The amount of any such fine shall be established by the Secretary and may be assessed and collected in accordance with regulations issued under this chapter separately or in combination with any fiscal claim established by the Secretary. The Attorney General of the United States may institute judicial action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the person to collect the fine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disqualification of retailers who are disqualified under WIC program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall issue regulations providing criteria for the disqualification under this chapter of an approved retail food store or a wholesale food concern that is disqualified from accepting benefits under the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children established under section 1786 of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A disqualification under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be for the same length of time as the disqualification from the program referred to in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may begin at a later date than the disqualification from the program referred to in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notwithstanding section 2023 of this title, shall not be subject to judicial or administrative review.</p>

Such powers with respect to claims against recipients may be delegated by the Secretary to State agencies. The Secretary shall have the power to reduce amounts otherwise due to a State agency under section 2025 of this title to collect unpaid claims assessed against the State agency if the State agency has declined or exhausted its appeal rights under section 2023 of this title. In determining whether to settle, adjust, compromise, or waive a claim arising against a State agency pursuant to section 2025(c) of this title, the Secretary shall review a State agency's plans for new dollar investment in activities to improve program administration in order to reduce payment error, and shall take the State agency's plans for new dollar investment in such activities into consideration as the Secretary considers appropriate. To the extent that a State agency does not pay a claim established under section 2025(c)(1)(C) of this title, including an agreement to have all or part of the claim paid through a reduction in Federal administrative funding, within 30 days from the date on which the bill for collection is received by the State agency, the State agency shall be liable for interest on any unpaid portion of such claim accruing from the date on which the bill for collection was received by the State agency, unless the State agency appeals the claim under section 2025(c)(7) of this title. If the State agency appeals such claim (in whole or in part), the interest on any unpaid portion of the claim shall accrue from the date of the decision on the administrative appeal, or from a date that is 1 year after the date the bill is received, whichever is earlier, until the date the unpaid portion of the payment is received. If the State agency pays such claim (in whole or in part, including an agreement to have all or part of the claim paid through a reduction in Federal administrative funding) and the claim is subsequently overturned through administrative or judicial appeal, any amounts paid by the State agency shall be promptly returned with interest, accruing from the date the payment is received until the date the payment is returned. Any interest assessed under this paragraph shall be computed at a rate determined by the Secretary based on the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day Treasury bill auction rates during the period such interest accrues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each adult member of a household shall be jointly and severally liable for the value of any overissuance of coupons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Collection of overissuances</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Maximum reduction absent fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a household received an overissuance of coupons without any member of the household being found ineligible to participate in the program under section 2015(b)(1) of this title and a State agency elects to reduce the allotment of the household under paragraph (1)(A), the State agency shall not reduce the monthly allotment of the household under paragraph (1)(A) by an amount in excess of the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 10 percent of the monthly allotment of the household; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) $10.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State agency shall collect an overissuance of coupons issued to a household under paragraph (1) in accordance with the requirements established by the State agency for providing notice, electing a means of payment, and establishing a time schedule for payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Food stamp intercept of unemployment benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;uncollected overissuance&rdquo; means the amount of an overissuance of coupons, as determined under subsection (b)(1) of this section, that has not <!-- PDFPage:1089 -->been recovered pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State agency may recover an uncollected overissuance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) entering into an agreement with an individual described in paragraph (2) under which specified amounts will be withheld from unemployment compensation otherwise payable to the individual; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (k) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to pay to each State agency an amount equal to 50 per centum of all administrative costs involved in each State agency's operation of the food stamp program, which costs shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of (1) the certification of applicant households, (2) the acceptance, storage, protection, control, and accounting of coupons after their delivery to receiving points within the State, (3) the issuance of coupons to all eligible households, (4) food stamp informational activities, including those undertaken under section 2020(e)(1)(A) of this title, but not including recruitment activities, (5) fair hearings, (6) automated data processing and information retrieval systems subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (g) of this section, (7) food stamp program investigations and prosecutions, and (8) implementing and operating the immigration status verification system established under section 1137(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&ndash;7(d)): <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary is authorized at the Secretary's discretion to pay any State agency administering the food stamp program on all or part of an Indian reservation under section 2020(d) of this title or in a Native village within the State of Alaska identified in section 1610(b) of title 43.<sup><a href="#2025_1_target" name="2025_1">1</a></sup> such amounts for administrative costs as the Secretary determines to be necessary for effective operation of the food stamp program, as well as to permit each State to retain 35 percent of the value of all funds or allotments recovered or collected pursuant to sections 2015(b) and 2022(c) of this title and 20 percent of the value of any other funds or allotments recovered or collected, except the value of funds or allotments recovered or collected that arise from an error of a State agency. The officials responsible for making determinations of ineligibility under this chapter shall not receive or benefit from revenues retained by the State under the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Work supplementation or support program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) &ldquo;Work supplementation or support program&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the term &ldquo;work supplementation or support program&rdquo; means a program under which, as determined by the Secretary, public assistance (including any benefits provided under a program established by the State and the food stamp program) is provided to an employer to be used for hiring and employing a public assistance recipient who was not employed by the employer at the time the public assistance recipient entered the program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State agency may elect to use an amount equal to the allotment that would otherwise be issued to a household under the food stamp program, but for the operation of this subsection, for the purpose of subsidizing or supporting a job under a work supplementation or support program established by the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State agency makes an election under paragraph (2) and identifies each household that participates in the food stamp program that contains an individual who is participating in the work supplementation or support program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to the value of the allotment that the household would be eligible to receive but for the operation of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State agency shall expend the amount received under subparagraph (A) in accordance with the work supplementation or support program in lieu of providing the allotment that the household would receive but for the operation of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) sections 2014 and 2017(a) of this title, the amount received under this subsection shall be excluded from household income and resources; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the household shall not receive an allotment from the State agency for the period during which the member continues to participate in the work supplementation or support program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other work requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No individual shall be excused, by reason of the fact that a State has a work supplementation or support program, from any work requirement under section 2015(d) of this title, except during the periods in which the individual is employed under the work supplementation or support program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Length of participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State agency shall provide a description of how the public assistance recipients in the program shall, within a specific period of time, be moved from supplemented or supported employment to employment that is not supplemented or supported.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Displacement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A work supplementation or support program shall not displace the employment of individuals who are not supplemented or supported.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment error improvement system; purposes, establishment, definitions, implementation, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The program authorized under this chapter shall include a system that enhances payment accuracy by establishing fiscal incentives that require State agencies with high error rates to share in the cost of payment error and provide enhanced administrative funding to States with the lowest error rates. Under such system&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary shall adjust a State agency's federally funded share of administrative costs pursuant to subsection (a) of this sec<!-- PDFPage:1095 -->tion, other than the costs already shared in excess of 50 percent under the proviso in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section or under subsection (g) of this section, by increasing such share of all such administrative costs by one percentage point to a maximum of 60 percent of all such administrative costs for each full one-tenth of a percentage point by which the payment error rate is less than 6 percent, except that only States whose rate of invalid decisions in denying eligibility is less than a nationwide percentage that the Secretary determines to be reasonable shall be entitled to the adjustment prescribed in this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary shall foster management improvements by the States by requiring State agencies other than those receiving adjustments under subparagraph (A) to develop and implement corrective action plans to reduce payment errors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for any fiscal year in which a State agency's payment error rate exceeds the national performance measure for payment error rates announced under paragraph (6), other than for good cause shown, the State agency shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2025_2_target" name="2025_2">2</a></sup> the product of&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) 1; times</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amount of liability shall not be affected by corrective action under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;payment error rate&rdquo; means the sum of the point estimates of an overpayment error rate and an underpayment error rate determined by the Secretary from data collected in a probability sample of participating households;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the term &ldquo;overpayment error rate&rdquo; means the percentage of the value of all allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency that are either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) issued to households that fail to meet basic program eligibility requirements; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) overissued to eligible households; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the term &ldquo;underpayment error rate&rdquo; means the ratio of the value of allotments underissued to recipient households to the total value of allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The following errors may be measured for management purposes but shall not be included in the payment error rate:</p>

Not later than seven days after the Secretary takes any action to reduce allotments under this section, the Secretary shall furnish the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a statement setting forth (1) the basis of the Secretary's determination, (2) the manner in which the allotments will be reduced, and (3) the action that has been taken by the Secretary to reduce the allotments.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nature of Project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In an application submitted under subsection (a) of this section, the State shall provide the following:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Paragraphs (1)(B) and (8) of section 2020(e) of this title shall apply with respect to applicants and participating families in the same manner as such paragraphs apply with respect to applicants and participants in the food stamp program.</p>

Food coupons shall be issued to eligible families and individuals described in this clause <!-- PDFPage:1124 -->retroactive to the date of termination from the Project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If sections 256.031 through 256.036 of the Minnesota Statutes, 1989 Supplement, or Minnesota Laws 1989, chapter 282, article 5, section 130, are amended to reduce or eliminate benefits provided under those sections or restrict the rights of Project applicants or participating families, the State shall exclude from the Project applicants or participating families or individuals affected by such amendments and follow the standards specified in subparagraph (C), except that the State shall continue to pay from State funds an amount equal to the food assistance portion to such families and individuals until the State determines eligibility or ineligibility for the food stamp program or the family or individual has failed to supply the needed additional information within ten days. Food coupons shall be provided to families and individuals excluded from the Project under this clause who are determined eligible for the food stamp program retroactive to the date of the determination of eligibility. The Secretary shall pay to the State the value of the food coupons for which such families and individuals would have been eligible in the absence of food assistance payments under this clause from the date of termination from the Project to the date food coupons are provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Each family whose Project participation is terminated shall be screened for potential eligibility for the food stamp program and if the screening indicates potential eligibility, the family or family member shall be given a specific request to supply all additional information needed to determine such eligibility and assistance in completing a signed food stamp program application including provision of any relevant information obtained by the State for purpose of the Project. If the family or family member supplies such additional information within ten days after receiving the request, the State shall, within five days after the State receives such information, determine whether the family or family member is eligible for the food stamp program. Each family or family member who is determined through the screening or otherwise to be ineligible for the food stamp program shall be notified of that determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Section 2020(e)(10) of this title shall apply with respect to applicant and participating families in the same manner as such paragraph applies with respect to applicants and participants in the food stamp program, except that families shall be given notice of any action for which a hearing is available in a manner consistent with the notice requirements of the regulations implementing sections 402(a)(4) and 482(h)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2031_1_target" name="2031_1">1</a></sup> of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 602(a)(4)].</p>
