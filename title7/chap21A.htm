<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Transactions in tobacco involving the sale thereof at auction as commonly conducted at auction markets are affected with a public interest; such transactions are carried on by tobacco producers generally and by persons engaged in the business of buying and selling tobacco in commerce; the classification of tobacco according to type, grade, and other characteristics affect the prices received therefor by producers; without uniform standards of classification and inspection the evaluation of tobacco is susceptible to speculation, manipulation, and control, and unreasonable fluctuations in prices and quality determinations occur which are detrimental to producers and persons handling tobacco in commerce; such fluctuations constitute a burden upon commerce and make the use of uniform standards of classification and inspection imperative for the protection of producers and others engaged in commerce and the public interest therein.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to designate those auction markets where tobacco bought and sold thereon at auction, or the products customarily manufactured therefrom, moves in commerce. Before any market is designated by the Secretary under this section he shall determine by referendum the desire of tobacco growers who sold tobacco at auction on such market during the preceding marketing season. The Secretary may at his discretion hold one referendum for two or more markets or for all markets in a type area. No market or group of markets shall be designated by the Secretary unless two-thirds of the growers voting favor it. The Secretary shall have access to the tobacco records of the Collector of Internal Revenue and of the several collectors of internal revenue for the purpose of obtaining the names and addresses of growers who sold tobacco on any auction market, and the Secretary shall determine from said records the eligibility of such grower to vote in such referendum, and no grower shall be eligible to vote in more than one referendum. After public notice of not less than thirty days that any auction market has been so designated by the Secretary, no tobacco shall be offered for sale at auction on such market until it shall have been inspected and certified by an authorized representative of the Secretary according to the standards established under this chapter, except that the Secretary may temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification at any designated market whenever he finds it impracticable to provide for such inspection and certification because competent inspectors are not obtainable or because the quantity of tobacco available for inspection is insufficient to justify the cost of such service: <em>Provided</em>, That, in the event competent inspectors are not available, or for other reasons, the Secretary is unable to provide for such inspection and certification at all auction markets within a type area, he shall first designate those auction markets where the greatest number of growers may be served with the facilities available to him. The Secretary shall by regulation fix and collect fees and charges for inspection and certification, the establishment of standards, and other services under this section at designated auction markets. The fees and charges authorized by this section shall, as nearly as practicable, cover the costs of the services, including the administrative and supervisory costs customarily included by the Secretary in user fee calculations. The fees and charges, late payment penalties, and interest earned from the investment of such funds, when collected, shall be credited to the current appropriation account that incurs the cost and shall be available without fiscal year limitation to pay the expenses of the Secretary incident to providing services under this chapter. Any funds realized from the collection of fees or charges authorized under this section and section 511e of this title and credited to the current appropriation account incurring the cost of services provided under this section and section 511e of this title, late payment penalties, and interest earned from the investment of such funds may be invested by the Secretary in insured or fully collateralized, interest-bearing accounts or, at the discretion of the Secretary, by the Secretary of the Treasury in United States Government debt instruments. Any income realized from this activity may be used to pay the expenses of the Secretary of Agriculture incident to providing services under this chapter or reinvested in the manner authorized in the preceding sentence. The fees and charges authorized in this section shall be assessed against the ware<!-- PDFPage:344 -->house operator, irrespective of ownership or interest in the tobacco, and shall be collected by the warehouse operator from the sellers of the tobacco. The inspection and related services under this section shall be suspended or denied if the warehouse operator fails to collect or otherwise pay the fees and charges imposed under this section. Tobacco inspection or certification services provided to designated auction markets shall take precedence over such services, other than reinspection, requested under the authority contained in section 511e of this title or any other provision of law. In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Secretary shall establish a national advisory committee of tobacco producers, and advisory subcommittees for each major kind of tobacco, to advise the Secretary with regard to the level of inspection and related services and the fees and charges therefor. The advisory committee and subcommittees established under this section shall be of permanent duration. The committees shall meet at the call of the Secretary.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inspection for grade and quality; exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) All tobacco offered for importation into the United States, except tobacco described in paragraph (2), shall be inspected, insofar as practicable, for grade and quality as tobacco marketed through a warehouse in the United States is inspected for grade and quality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Cigar tobacco and oriental tobacco (both as provided for in chapter 24 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) offered for importation into the United States shall be accompanied by a certification by the importer, in such form as the Secretary of Agriculture may prescribe, stating the kind and type of such tobacco, and, in the case of cigar tobacco, that such tobacco will be used solely in the manufacture or production of cigars.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of grade and quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish grade and quality standards for the purposes of subsection (a)(1) of this section that are, insofar as practicable, the same as those applicable to tobacco marketed through a warehouse in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification necessary for excepted tobacco; false statements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any tobacco described in subsection (a)(2) of this section that is not accompanied by the certification required by that subsection shall not be permitted entry into the United States. The provisions of section 1001 of title 18 shall be applicable with respect to any certification made by an importer under such subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:347 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Place of inspection; fees and charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall enforce the provisions of subsection (a) of this section at the point of entry of tobacco offered for importation into the United States. The Secretary shall by regulation fix and collect from the importer fees and charges for inspection under subsection (a)(1) and subsection (e) of this section which shall, as nearly as practicable, cover the costs of such services, including the administrative and supervisory costs customarily included by the Secretary in user fee calculations, and which shall be comparable to fees and charges fixed and collected for services provided in connection with tobacco produced in the United States. The fees and charges, when collected, shall be credited to the current appropriation account that incurs the cost and shall be available without fiscal year limitation to pay the expenses of the Secretary incident to providing services under subsection (a)(1) of this section, subsection (e) of this section, and subsection (f) of this section. Any fees collected, late payment penalties, and interest earned shall be credited to the account referred to in this section and may be invested by the Secretary of Agriculture in insured or fully-collateralized interest-bearing accounts or, at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture, by the Secretary of the Treasury in United States Government debt instruments. Fees and charges, including late payment penalties, and interest earned from the investment of such funds shall be credited to the account referred to in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Tobacco pesticide residues; certification, etc., requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) All flue-cured or burley tobacco offered for importation into the United States shall be accompanied by a certification by the importer, in such form as the Secretary of Agriculture shall prescribe, that the tobacco does not contain any prohibited residue of any pesticide that has been cancelled, suspended, revoked, or otherwise prohibited under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.]. Any flue-cured or burley tobacco that is not accompanied by such certification shall be inspected by the Secretary at the point of entry to determine whether that tobacco meets the pesticide residue requirements. Subsection (d) of this section shall apply with respect to fees and charges imposed to cover the costs of such inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any tobacco that is determined by the Secretary not to meet the pesticide residue requirements shall not be permitted entry into the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The customs fraud provisions under section 1592 of title 19 and criminal fraud provisions under section 1001 of title 18 shall apply with respect to the certification requirement in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary shall by regulation provide for pesticide residue standards with respect to pesticides that are cancelled, suspended, revoked, or otherwise prohibited under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.], that shall apply to flue-cured and burley tobacco, whether domestically produced or imported.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary, to such extent and at such times as the Secretary determines appropriate, shall sample and test flue-cured and burley tobacco offered for importation or for sale in the United States to determine whether it conforms with the pesticide residue requirements. The Secretary shall by regulation impose fees and charges for such inspections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Secretary determines, as a result of tests conducted under paragraph (3), that certain flue-cured or burley tobacco offered for importation does not meet the requirements of this subsection, then such tobacco shall not be permitted entry into the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), if the Secretary determines that domestically produced Flue-cured&nbsp;<sup><a href="#511r_1_target" name="511r_1">1</a></sup> or Burley&nbsp;<sup><a href="#511r_1_target" name="511r_1">1</a></sup> tobacco does not meet the requirements of this section, such tobacco may not be moved in commerce among the States and shall be destroyed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) This paragraph shall apply only to tobacco produced after December 23, 1985, that receives price support under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.) or the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) End users of imported tobacco; certification, identification, etc., requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The certification required under subsection (e)(1) of this section shall also include the identification of any and all end users of such tobacco of which the importer has knowledge. Any flue cured&nbsp;<sup><a href="#511r_2_target" name="511r_2">2</a></sup> or burley tobacco permitted entry into the United States must be accompanied by a written identification of any and all end users of such tobacco. In cases in which the importer has no knowledge of the identity of an end user, the importer shall identify any and all purchasers to whom the importer expects to transfer such imported tobacco. The importer shall file with the Department of Agriculture an amended statement if, at any time after the time of entry of such tobacco imports, the importer has knowledge of any additional purchaser or end user. In those cases in which the importer has not identified all end users of such imported tobacco, the Secretary of Agriculture shall take all steps available to ascertain the identity of any and all such end users, including requesting such information from purchasers of such imported tobacco. Domestic purchasers of imported tobacco shall be required to supply any relevant information to the Department of Agriculture upon demand under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall provide to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and the House Committee on Agriculture, on or before April 1, 1986, a report on the implementation of this authority to identify each end user and purchaser of imported tobacco. Such report shall identify the end users and purchasers of imported tobacco and the quantity, in pounds, bought by such end user or purchaser, as well as all steps taken by the Department of Ag<!-- PDFPage:348 -->riculture to ascertain such identities. The Secretary shall provide an additional report, beginning November 15, 1986, and annual reports thereafter, on the implementation of this authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;end user of imported tobacco&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes or other tobacco products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an entity that mixes, blends, processes, alters in any manner, or stores, imported tobacco for export; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any other individual that the Secretary may identify as making use of imported tobacco for the production of tobacco products.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Subsection (d) of this section shall apply with respect to fees and charges imposed to cover the costs of such end user identification, certification, and reporting activities.</p>
