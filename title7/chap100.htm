<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allocation of purchase prices</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply with respect to a producer for a particular calendar year if the producer has already received a refund under section 204(h) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 for the same fiscal year before the effective date of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A refund under this subsection shall not be considered as any type of price support or payment for purposes of sections 3811 and 3821 of title 16.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7253. Consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amendment of orders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required consolidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall amend Federal milk marketing orders issued under section 608c of this title to limit the number of Federal milk marketing orders to not less than 10 and not more than 14 orders.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inclusion of California as separate order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the petition and approval of California dairy producers in the manner provided in section 608c of this title, the Secretary shall designate the State of California as a separate Federal milk marketing order. The order covering California shall have the right to reblend and distribute order receipts to recognize quota value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Related issues addressed in consolidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Among the issues the Secretary is authorized to implement as part of the consolidation of Federal milk marketing orders are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The use of utilization rates and multiple basing points for the pricing of fluid milk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The use of uniform multiple component pricing when developing 1 or more basic formula prices for manufacturing milk.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect of existing law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In implementing the consolidation of Federal milk marketing orders and related reforms under this subsection, the Secretary may not consider, or base any decision on, the table contained in section 608c(5)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Expedited process</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use of informal rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To implement the consolidation of Federal milk marketing orders and related reforms under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall use the notice and comment procedures provided in section 553 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Proposed amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall announce the proposed amendments to be made under subsection (a) of this section not later than 2 years after April 4, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Final amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall implement the amendments not later than 3 years after April 4, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of court order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The actions authorized by this subsection are intended to ensure the timely publication and implementation of new and amended Federal milk marketing orders. In the event that the Secretary is enjoined or otherwise restrained by a court order from publishing or implementing the consolidation and related reforms under subsection (a) of this section, the length of time for which that injunction or other restraining order is effective shall be added to the time limitations specified in paragraph (2) thereby extending those time limitations by a period of time equal to the period of time for which the injunction or other restraining order is effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Failure to timely consolidate orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary fails to implement the consolidation required under subsection (a)(1) of this section within the time period required under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section (plus any additional period provided under subsection (b)(3) of this section), the Secretary may not assess or collect assessments from milk producers or handlers under such section 608c of this title for marketing order administration and services provided under such section after the end of that period until the consolidation is completed. The Secretary may not reduce the level of services provided under the section on account of the prohibition against assessments, but shall rather cover the cost of marketing order administration and services through funds available for the Agricultural Marketing Service of the Department.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report regarding further reforms</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than April 1, 1997, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reviewing the Federal milk marketing order system established pursuant to section 608c of this title in light of the reforms required by subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) describing the efforts underway and the progress made in implementing the reforms required by subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) containing such recommendations as the Secretary considers appropriate for further improvements and reforms to the Federal milk marketing order system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any limitation imposed by Act of Congress on the conduct or completion of reports to Congress shall not apply to the report required under this section, unless the limitation specifically refers to this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress hereby consents to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact entered into among the States of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont as specified in section 1(b) Senate Joint Resolution 28 of the 104th Congress, as placed on the calendar of the Senate, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Finding of compelling public interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Based upon a finding by the Secretary of a compelling public interest in the Compact region, the Secretary may grant the States that have ratified the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, as of April 4, 1996, the authority to implement the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Duration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consent for the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact shall terminate on September 30, 2001.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia are the only additional States that may join the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, individually or otherwise, if upon entry the State is contiguous to a participating State and if Congress consents to the entry of the State into the Compact after April 4, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Compensation of Commodity Credit Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the end of each fiscal year that a Compact price regulation is in effect, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission shall compensate the Commodity Credit Corporation for the cost of any purchases of milk and milk products by the Corporation that result from the projected rate of increase in milk production for the fiscal year within the Compact region in excess of the projected national average rate of the increase in milk production, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Milk marketing order Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the request of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission, the Administrator of the applicable Federal milk marketing order issued under section 608c(5)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7256_1_target" name="7256_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall provide technical assistance to the Compact Commission and be compensated for that assistance.</p>

The Compact Commission shall respect and abide by the ongoing procedures between Federal milk marketing orders with respect to the sharing of proceeds from sales within the Compact region of bulk milk, packaged milk, or producer milk originating from outside of the Compact region. The Compact Commission shall not use compensatory payments under section 10(6) of the Compact as a barrier to the entry of milk into the Compact region or for any other purpose. Establishment of a Compact over-order price, in itself, shall not be considered a compensatory payment or a limitation or prohibition on the marketing of milk.</p>
