<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The marketing of tobacco constitutes one of the greatest basic industries of the United States with ramifying activities which directly affect interstate and foreign commerce at every point, and stable conditions therein are necessary to the general welfare. Tobacco produced for market is sold on a Nation-wide market and, with its products, moves almost wholly in interstate and foreign commerce from the producer to the ultimate consumer. The farmers producing such commodity are subject in their operations to uncontrollable natural causes, are widely scattered throughout the Nation, in many cases such farmers carry on their farming operations on borrowed money or leased lands, and are not so situated as to be able to organize effectively, as can labor and industry through unions and corporations enjoying Government protection and sanction. For these reasons among others, the farmers are unable without Federal assistance to control effectively the orderly marketing of such commodity with the result that abnormally excessive supplies thereof are produced and dumped indiscriminately on the Nation-wide market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The disorderly marketing of such abnormally excessive supplies affects, burdens, and obstructs interstate and foreign commerce by (1) materially affecting the volume of such commodity marketed therein, (2) disrupting the orderly marketing of such commodity therein, (3) reducing the price for such commodity with consequent injury and destruction of interstate and foreign commerce in such commodity, and (4) causing a disparity between the prices for such commodity in interstate and foreign commerce and industrial products therein, with a consequent diminution of the volume of interstate and foreign commerce in industrial products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whenever an abnormally excessive supply of tobacco exists, the marketing of such commodity by the producers thereof directly and substantially affects interstate and foreign commerce in such commodity and its products, and the operation of the provisions of this subpart becomes necessary and appropriate in order to promote, foster, and maintain an orderly flow of such supply in interstate and foreign commerce.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Proclamation of quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, not later than December 1 of any marketing year with respect to flue-cured tobacco, February 1 of any marketing year with respect to Burley tobacco, and March 1 of any marketing year with respect to other kinds of tobacco, proclaim a national marketing quota for any kind of tobacco for each of the next three succeeding marketing years whenever he determines with respect to such kind of tobacco&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that a national marketing quota has not previously been proclaimed and the total supply as of the beginning of such marketing year exceeds the reserve supply level therefor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that such marketing year is the last year of three consecutive years for which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that amendments have been made in provisions for establishing farm acreage allotments which will cause material revision of such allotments before the end of the period for which quotas are in effect; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that a marketing quota previously proclaimed for such marketing year is not in effect because of disapproval by producers in a referendum held pursuant to subsection (c) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That if such producers have disapproved national marketing quotas in referenda held in three successive years subsequent to 1952, thereafter a national marketing quota shall not be proclaimed hereunder which would be in effect for any marketing year within the three-year period for which national marketing quotas previously proclaimed were disapproved by producers in a referendum, unless prior to November 10 of the marketing year one-fourth or more of the farmers engaged in the production of the crop of tobacco harvested in the calendar year in which such marketing year begins petition the Secretary, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, to proclaim a national marketing quota for each of the next three succeeding marketing years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Announcement of amount of quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also determine and announce, not later than the first day of December with respect to flue-cured tobacco, not later than the first day of February with respect to Burley tobacco, and not later than the first day of March with respect to other kinds of tobacco, the amount of the national marketing quota proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section which is in effect for the next marketing year in terms of the total quantity of tobacco which may be marketed which will make available during such marketing year a supply of tobacco equal to the reserve supply level. The amount of the national marketing quota so announced may, not later than the following March 1, be increased by not more than 20 per centum if the Secretary determines that such increase is necessary in order to meet market demands or to avoid undue restrictions of marketings in adjusting the total supply to the reserve supply level.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Referendum on quotas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within thirty days after the proclamation of national marketing quotas under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of farmers engaged in the production of the crop of tobacco harvested immediately prior to the holding of the referendum to determine whether such farmers are in favor of or opposed to such quotas for the next three suc<!-- PDFPage:503 -->ceeding marketing years. If more than one-third of the farmers voting oppose the national marketing quotas, such results shall be proclaimed by the Secretary and the national marketing quotas so proclaimed shall not be in effect but such results shall in no wise affect or limit the subsequent proclamation and submission to a referendum, as otherwise provided in this section, of a national marketing quota.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1313. Apportionment of national marketing quota</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Apportionment among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national marketing quota for tobacco established pursuant to the provisions of section 1312 of this title, less the amount to be allotted under subsection (c) of this section, shall be apportioned by the Secretary among the several States on the basis of the total production of tobacco in each State during the five calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the quota is proclaimed (plus, in applicable years, the normal production on the acreage diverted under previous agricultural adjustment and conservation programs), with such adjustments as are determined to be necessary to make correction for abnormal conditions of production, for small farms, and for trends in production, giving due consideration to seed bed and other plant diseases during such five-year period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section and section 1312 of this title, except the provisions in subsection (g) of this section relating to reduction of allotments, for any of the three marketing years, 1941&ndash;1942 to 1943&ndash;1944, in which a national marketing quota is in effect for burley or flue-cured tobacco, such national marketing quota shall not be reduced below the 1940&ndash;1941 national marketing quota by more than 10 per centum and the farm-acreage allotments (other than allotments established in each year under subsection (g) of this section for farms on which no tobacco was produced in the last five years) shall be determined by increasing or decreasing the farm-acreage allotments established in the last preceding year in which marketing quotas were in effect in the same ratio as such national marketing quota is increased or decreased above or below the last preceding national marketing quota: <em>Provided</em>, That in the case of flue-cured tobacco no allotment shall be decreased below the 1940 allotment if such allotment was two acres or less, and in the case of burley tobacco no allotment shall be decreased below the 1939 allotment if such allotment was one-half acre or less, or below the 1940 allotment if such allotment was over one-half acre and not over one acre: <em>And provided further</em>, That an additional acreage not in excess of 2 per centum of the total acreage allotted to all farms in each State in 1940 shall be allotted by the local committees, without regard to the ratio aforesaid, among farms in the State in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary so as to establish allotments which the committees find will be fair and equitable in relation to the past acreage of tobacco (harvested and diverted); land, labor, and equipment available for the production of tobacco; and crop-rotation practices: <em>And provided further</em>, That the burley tobacco acreage allotment which would otherwise be established for any farm having a burley acreage allotment in 1942 shall not be less than one-half acre, and the acreage required for apportionment under this proviso shall be in addition to the National and State acreage allotments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allotment of quota among producing farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide, through the local committees, for the allotment of the marketing quota for any State among the farms on which tobacco is produced, on the basis of the following: Past marketing of tobacco, making due allowance for drought, flood, hail, other abnormal weather conditions, plant bed, and other diseases; land, labor, and equipment available for the production of tobacco; crop-rotation practices; and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That, except for farms on which for the first time in five years tobacco is produced to be marketed in the marketing year for which the quota is effective, the marketing quota for any farm shall not be less than the smaller of either (1) three thousand two hundred pounds, in the case of flue-cured tobacco, and two thousand four hundred pounds, in the case of other kinds of tobacco, or (2) the average tobacco production for the farm during the preceding three years, plus the average normal production of any tobacco acreage diverted under agricultural adjustment and conservation programs during such preceding three years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allotment to previous nonproducing farms and small farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide, through local committees, for the allotment of not in excess of 5 per centum of the national marketing quota (1) to farms in any State whether it has a State quota or not on which for the first time in five years tobacco is produced to be marketed in the year for which the quota is effective and (2) for further increase of allotments to small farms pursuant to the proviso in subsection (b) of this section on the basis of the following: Land, labor, and equipment available for the production of tobacco; crop-rotation practices; and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That farm marketing quotas established pursuant to this subsection for farms on which tobacco is produced for the first time in five years shall not exceed 75 per centum of the farm marketing quotas established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for farms which are similar with respect to the following: Land, labor, and equipment avail<!-- PDFPage:505 -->able for the production of tobacco, crop-rotation practices, and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of tobacco.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of farm marketing quotas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Farm marketing quotas may be transferred only in such manner and subject to such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Quota for 1938; minimum State allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case of flue-cured tobacco, the national quota for 1938 is increased by a number of pounds required to provide for each State in addition to the State poundage allotment a poundage not in excess of 4 per centum of the allotment which shall be apportioned in amounts which the Secretary determines to be fair and reasonable to farms in the State receiving allotments under this chapter which the Secretary determines are inadequate in view of past production of tobacco, and for each year by a number of pounds sufficient to assure that any State receiving a State poundage allotment of flue-cured tobacco shall receive a minimum State poundage allotment of flue-cured tobacco equal to the average national yield for the preceding five years of five hundred acres of such tobacco.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Increase of 1938 quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of fire-cured and dark air-cured and burley tobacco, the national quota for 1938 is increased by a number of pounds required to provide for each State in addition to the State poundage allotment a poundage not in excess of 2 per centum of the allotment which shall be apportioned in amounts which the Secretary determines to be fair and reasonable to farms in the State receiving allotments under this section which the Secretary determines are inadequate in view of past production of tobacco.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Conversion of national marketing quota into national acreage allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may convert the national marketing quota into a national acreage allotment by dividing the national marketing quota by the national average yield for the five years immediately preceding the year in which the national marketing quota is proclaimed, and may apportion the national acreage allotment, less a reserve of not to exceed 1 per centum thereof for new farms, for making corrections in old farm acreage allotments, and for adjusting inequities in old farm acreage allotments, through the local committees among farms on the basis of the factors set forth in subsection (b) of this section, using past farm acreage and past farm acreage allotments for tobacco in lieu of past marketing of tobacco; and the Secretary on the basis of the factors set forth in subsection (c) of this section and the past tobacco experience of the farm operator, shall through the local committees allot that portion of the national acreage allotment reserved for new farms among farms on which no tobacco was produced or considered produced during the last five years. Any acreage of tobacco harvested in excess of the farm acreage allotment for the year 1955, or any subsequent crop shall not be taken into account in establishing State and farm acreage allotments. Except for farms last mentioned or a farm operated, controlled, or directed by a person who also operates, controls, or directs another farm on which tobacco is produced, the farm-acreage allotment shall be increased by the smaller of (1) 20 per centum of such allotment or (2) the percentage by which the normal yield of such allotment (as determined through the local committees in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) is less than three thousand two hundred pounds, in the case of flue-cured tobacco, and two thousand four hundred pounds in the case of other kinds of tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That the normal yield of the estimated number of acres so added to farm acreage allotments in any State shall be considered as a part of the State marketing quota in applying the proviso in subsection (a) of this section. The actual production of the acreage allotment established for a farm pursuant to this subsection shall be the amount of the farm marketing quota. If any amount of tobacco shall be marketed as having been produced on the acreage allotment for any farm which in fact was produced on a different farm, the acreage allotments next established for both such farms shall be reduced by that percentage which such amount was of the respective farm marketing quota, except that such reduction for any such farm shall not be made if the Secretary through the local committees finds that no person connected with such farm caused, aided, or acquiesced in such marketing; and if proof of the disposition of any amount of tobacco is not furnished as required by the Secretary or if any producer on the farm files, or aids or acquiesces in the filing of, any false report with respect to the acreage of tobacco grown on the farm required by regulations issued pursuant to this chapter, the acreage allotment next established for the farm on which such tobacco is produced shall be reduced by a percentage similarly computed. If in any calendar year more than one crop of tobacco is grown from (1) the same tobacco plants or (2) different tobacco plants, and is harvested for marketing from the same acreage of a farm, the acreage allotment next established for such farm shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to the acreage from which more than one crop of tobacco has been so grown and harvested.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Increase of marketing quotas and acreage allotments to meet demand</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, whenever after investigation the Secretary determines with respect to any kind of tobacco that a substantial difference exists in the usage or market outlets for any one or more of the types comprising such kind of tobacco and that the quantity of tobacco of such type or types to be produced under the marketing quotas and acreage allotments established pursuant to this section would not be sufficient to provide an adequate supply for estimated market demands and carry-over requirements for such type or types of tobacco, the Secretary shall increase the marketing quotas and acreage <!-- PDFPage:506 -->allotments for farms producing such type or types of tobacco in the preceding year to the extent necessary to make available a supply of such type or types of tobacco adequate to meet such demands and carry-over requirements. The increases in farm marketing quotas and acreage allotments shall be made on the basis of the production of such type or types of tobacco during the period of years considered in establishing farm marketing quotas and acreage allotments for such kind of tobacco. The additional production authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to the national marketing quota established for such kind of tobacco pursuant to section 1312 of this title. The increase in acreage under this subsection shall not be considered in establishing future State or farm acreage allotments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In establishing farm acreage allotments for burley tobacco crops for the years 1956, 1957, and 1958 the acreage allotment for any farm which has not been retired from agricultural production shall not be reduced below the acreage allotment which would otherwise be established because the harvested acreage was less than the allotted acreage unless the acreage harvested was less than 50 per centum of the allotted acreage in each of the preceding five years, in which event it shall not be reduced for such reason to less than the largest acreage harvested in any year in such five-year period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Persons liable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The marketing of (1) any kind of tobacco in excess of the marketing quota for the farm on which the tobacco is produced, or (2) any kind of tobacco that is not eligible for price support under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.] because a producer on the farm has not agreed to make contributions or pay assessments to the No Net Cost Tobacco Fund or the No Net Cost Tobacco Account as required by sections 106A(d)(1) and 106(B)(d)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1314_1_target" name="1314_1">1</a></sup> of that Act [7 U.S.C. 1445&ndash;1(d)(1) and 1445&ndash;2(d)(1)], if marketing quotas for that kind of tobacco are in effect, shall be subject to a penalty of 75 per centum of the average market price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for such kind of tobacco for the immediately preceding marketing year. Such penalty shall be paid by the person who acquired such tobacco from the producer but an amount equivalent to the penalty may be deducted by the buyer from the price paid to the producer in case such tobacco is marketed by sale; or, if the tobacco is marketed by the producer through a warehouseman or other agent, such penalty shall be paid by such warehouseman or agent who may deduct an amount equivalent to the penalty from the price paid to the producer: <em>Provided</em>, That in case any tobacco is marketed directly to any person outside the United States the penalty shall be paid and remitted by the producer. If any producer falsely identifies or fails to account for the disposition of any tobacco, an amount of tobacco equal to the normal yield of the number of acres harvested in excess of the farm-acreage allotment shall be deemed to have been marketed in excess of the marketing quota for the farm, and the penalty in respect thereof shall be paid and remitted by the producer. Tobacco carried over by the producer thereof from one marketing year to another may be marketed without payment of the penalty imposed by this section if the total amount of tobacco available for marketing from the farm in the marketing year from which the tobacco is carried over did not exceed the farm marketing quota established for the farm for such marketing year (or which would have been established if marketing quotas had been in effect for such marketing year), or if the tobacco so carried over does not exceed the normal production of that number of acres by which the harvested acreage of tobacco in the calendar year in which the marketing year begins is less than the farm-acreage allotment. Tobacco produced in a calendar year in which marketing quotas are in effect for the marketing year beginning therein shall be subject to such quotas even though it is marketed prior to the date on which such marketing year begins.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Collection and deposit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require collection of the penalty upon a proportion of each lot of tobacco marketed from the farm equal to the proportion which the tobacco available for marketing from the farm in excess of the farm marketing quota is of the total amount of tobacco available for marketing from the farm if satisfactory proof is not furnished as to the disposition to be made of such excess tobacco prior to the marketing of any tobacco from the farm. All funds collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a special deposit account with the Treasurer of the United States until the end of the marketing year next succeeding that in which the funds are collected, and upon certification by the Secretary there shall be paid out of such special deposit account to persons designated by the Secretary the amount by which the penalty collected exceeds the amount of penalty due upon tobacco marketed in excess of the farm marketing quota for any farm. Such special account shall be administered by the Secretary, and the basis for, the amount of, and the person entitled to receive a payment from such account, when determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, shall be final and conclusive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lien in favor of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until the amount of the penalty provided by this section is paid, a lien on the tobacco with respect to which such penalty is incurred, and on any subsequent tobacco subject to marketing quotas in which the person liable for payment of the penalty has an interest, shall be in effect in favor of the United States for the amount of the penalty.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The Secretary, if the Secretary determines that it will not impair the effective operation of the tobacco marketing quota or price support program, may permit the owner and operator of any farm for which a tobacco acreage allotment (other than a Burley, Flue-cured, dark air-cured, Fire-cured, Virginia sun-cured and cigar-binder, type 54 or 55 tobacco acreage allotment) is established under this chapter to lease and transfer all or any part of such allotment to any other owner or operator of a farm in the same county for use in such county on a farm having a current tobacco allotment of the same kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Secretary shall, only with respect to the 1984 through 1986 crops of Flue-cured tobacco, permit the owner of a farm to which a Flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment or quota is assigned under this chapter to lease and transfer all or any part of such allotment or quota to any other owner or operator of a farm in the same county for use in such county on a farm having a current Flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment or quota except that for the 1985 and 1986 crops such lease and transfer shall be permitted only if (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2)(A)) the parties to the lease file a copy of the lease agreement with the county committee for the county in which the farms are located, together with a written statement certifying that none of the consideration for the lease has been or will be paid to the lessor, either directly or indirectly in any form including a loan by the lessee to the lessor, the endorsement of a note by the lessee for the lessor, or any other similar arrangement which represents the anticipated income for the lease, prior to the marketing of the tobacco produced under the lease and that the lease and transfer is otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this section. Beginning with the 1985 crop, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations establishing, insofar as is reasonably practicable, a similar requirement providing that none of the consideration for the lease of any Flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment and quota may be paid to the lessor prior to the marketing of the tobacco produced under the lease. The Secretary shall also require that any seller of a Flue-cured tobacco allotment and quota grant to the buyer an option to make payment therefore in equal annual installments payable each fall for a period not to exceed five years from the year in which the sale is made. With respect to the 1987 and subsequent crops of Flue-cured tobacco, the Secretary shall not permit the lease and transfer of Flue-cured tobacco acreage allotments and quotas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the county committee determines that the lessee or the lessor of a Flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment or quota knowingly made a false statement in the written statement filed under subparagraph (A), (i) in the case of a false statement knowingly made by the lessee, the lease agreement for purposes of the Flue-cured tobacco marketing quota program with respect to the lessee's farm shall be considered null and void as of the date approved by the county committee or (ii) in the case of a false statement knowingly made by the lessor, the Flue-cured tobacco allotment and quota next established for the farm of the lessor shall be reduced by the percentage which the leased allotment or quota was of the total Flue-cured tobacco allotment or quota for the farm. Notice of any determination made by the county committee under the preceding provision shall be mailed as soon as practicable to the lessee or lessor involved. If the lessee or lessor is dissatisfied with such determination, the lessee or lessor may request, within fifteen days after notice of such determination is mailed, a review of such determination by a local review committee under section 1363 of this title.</p>

The transfer shall be approved acre for acre.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allotments for other years unaffected; inclusion of amount in transferors&rsquo; plantings; referendum voting rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The lease and transfer of any part of a tobacco acreage allotment determined for a farm shall not affect the allotment for the farm from which such acreage allotment is transferred or the <!-- PDFPage:510 -->farm to which it is transferred, except with respect to the crop year specified in the lease. The amount of acreage allotment which is leased from a farm shall be considered for purpose of determining future allotments to have been planted to tobacco on the farm from which such allotment is transferred and the production pursuant to the lease and transfer shall not be taken into account in establishing allotments for subsequent years for the farm to which such allotment is transferred. The lessor shall be considered to have been engaged in the production of tobacco for the purpose of eligibility to vote in the referendum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on amount of acreage allotment; &ldquo;tillable cropland&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The total acreage allotted to any farm after the transfer by lease or sale of tobacco acreage allotment to the farm under the provisions of this section shall not exceed 50 per centum of the acreage of cropland in the farm.

For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;active Flue-cured tobacco producer&rdquo; means any person who shared in the risk of producing a crop of Flue-cured tobacco in not less than one of the three years preceding the year involved, or any person who certifies to the Secretary, in such form and manner as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe, his or her intent to become a Flue-cured tobacco producer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this section, a person shall be considered to have shared in the risk of producing a crop of Flue-cured tobacco if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the investment of such person in the production of such crop is not less than 20 per centum of the proceeds of the sale of such crop;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount of such person's return on such investment is dependent solely on the sale price of such crop; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such person may not receive any of such return before the sale of such crop.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Transfers allowed by referendum.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Referendum</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the request of at least 25 percent of the active flue-cured tobacco producers within a State, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of the active flue-cured tobacco producers within the State to determine whether the producers favor or oppose permitting the sale of a flue-cured tobacco allotment or quota from a farm in a State to any other farm in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines that a majority of the active flue-cured tobacco producers voting in the referendum approves permitting the sale of a flue-cured tobacco allotment or quota from a farm in the State to any other farm in the State, the Secretary shall permit the sale of a flue-cured tobacco allotment or quota from a farm in the State to any other farm in the State.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall, before July 1 of the year after the year of such disposal, take steps which will result in the total acreage of Flue-cured tobacco allotted to such farm not exceeding 50 per centum of the tillable cropland owned by such person.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) &ldquo;National average yield goal&rdquo; for any kind of tobacco means the yield per acre which on a national average basis the Secretary determines will improve or insure the usability of the tobacco and increase the net return per pound to the growers. In making this determination the Secretary shall give consideration to such Federal-State production research data as he deems relevant. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in 1983,,<sup><a href="#1314c_1_target" name="1314c_1">1</a></sup> the national average yield goal for Flue-cured tobacco shall be adjusted by the Secretary to the past five years&rsquo; moving national average yield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) &ldquo;National acreage allotment&rdquo; means the acreage determined by dividing the national marketing quota by the national average yield goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) &ldquo;Farm acreage allotment&rdquo; for a tobacco farm, other than a new tobacco farm, means the acreage allotment determined by adjusting uniformly the acreage allotment established for such farm for the immediately preceding year, prior to any increase or decrease in such allotment due to undermarketings or overmarketings and prior to any reduction under subsection (f) of this section, so that the total of all allotments is equal to the national acreage allotment less the reserve provided in subsection (e) of this section with a further downward or upward adjustment to reflect any adjustment in the farm marketing quota for overmarketing or undermarketing and to reflect any reduction required under subsection (f) of this section, and including any adjustment for errors or inequities from the reserve. In determining farm acreage allotments for Flue-cured tobacco for 1965, the 1965 farm allotment determined under section 1313 of this title shall be adjusted in lieu of the acreage allotment for the immediately preceding year. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, in 1983,,<sup><a href="#1314c_1_target" name="1314c_1">1</a></sup> farm acreage allotments for Flue-cured tobacco for farms in each county shall be adjusted by the Secretary to reflect the increases or decreases in the past five years&rsquo; moving county average yield per acre, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of actual yields of farms in the county, or, if such information is not available, on such other data on yields as the Secretary may deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The &ldquo;community average yield&rdquo; means for Flue-cured tobacco the average yield per acre in the community designated by the Secretary as a local administrative area under the provisions of section 590h(b) of title 16 which is determined by averaging the yields per acre for the three highest years of the five years 1959 to 1963, inclusive, except that if the yield for any of the three highest years is less than 80 per centum of the average for the three years then that year or years shall be eliminated and the average of the remaining years shall be the community aver<!-- PDFPage:516 -->age yield. Community average yields for other kinds of tobacco shall be determined in like manner, except that the five years 1960 to 1964, inclusive, may be used instead of the period 1959 to 1963, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) &ldquo;Preliminary farm yield&rdquo; for Flue-cured tobacco means a farm yield per acre determined by averaging the yield per acre for the three highest years of the five consecutive crop years beginning with the 1959 crop year except that if that average exceeds 120 per centum of the community average yield the preliminary farm yield shall be the sum of 50 per centum of the average of the three highest years and 50 per centum of the national average yield goal but not less than 120 per centum of the community average yield, and if the average of the three highest years is less than 80 per centum of the community average yield the preliminary farm yield shall be 80 per centum of the community average yield. In counties where less than five hundred acres of Flue-cured tobacco were allotted for 1964, the county may be considered as one community. If Flue-cured tobacco was not produced on the farm for at least three years of the five-year period the average of the yields for the years in which tobacco was produced shall be used instead of the three-year average. If no Flue-cured tobacco was produced on the farm in the five-year period but the farm is eligible for an allotment because Flue-cured tobacco was considered to have been produced under applicable provisions of law, a preliminary farm yield for the farm shall be determined under regulations of the Secretary taking into account preliminary farm yields of similar farms in the community. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, in 1983, preliminary farm yields for Flue-cured tobacco farms in each county shall be adjusted by the Secretary by the reciprocal of the factor computed in paragraph (4) of this subsection to adjust farm acreage allotments to reflect increases or decreases in the past five years&rsquo; moving county average yields.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) &ldquo;Preliminary farm yield&rdquo; for kinds of tobacco, other than Flue-cured, means a farm yield per acre determined in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (6) except that in lieu of the five consecutive crop years beginning with 1959 the immediately preceding 5 crop years shall be used by the Secretary. In counties where less than five hundred acres of the kind of tobacco for which the determination is being made were allotted in the last year of the five-year period the county may be considered as one community. If tobacco of the kind for which the determination is being made was not produced on the farm for at least three years of the five-year period, the average of the yields for the years in which the kind of tobacco was produced shall be used instead of the three-year average. If no tobacco of the kind for which the determination is being made was produced on the farm in the five-year period but the farm is eligible for an allotment because such tobacco was considered to have been produced under applicable provisions of law, a preliminary farm yield for the farm shall be determined under regulations of the Secretary taking into account preliminary farm yields of similar farms in the community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) &ldquo;Farm yield&rdquo; means the yield of tobacco per acre for a farm determined by multiplying the preliminary farm yield by a national yield factor which shall be obtained by dividing the national average yield goal by a weighted national average yield computed by multiplying the preliminary farm yield for each farm by the acreage allotment determined pursuant to paragraph (4) for the farm prior to adjustments for overmarketing, undermarketing, or reductions required under subsection (f) of this section and dividing the sum of the products by the national acreage allotment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) &ldquo;Farm marketing quota&rdquo; for any farm for any marketing year shall be the number of pounds of tobacco obtained by multiplying the farm yield by the acreage allotment prior to any adjustment for undermarketing or overmarketing, increased for undermarketing or decreased for overmarketing by the number of pounds by which marketings of tobacco from the farm during the immediately preceding marketing year, if marketing quotas were in effect under the program established by this section, is less than or exceeds the farm marketing quota for such year: <em>Provided</em>, That the farm marketing quota for any marketing year shall not be increased for undermarketing by an amount in excess of the number of pounds determined by multiplying the acreage allotment for the farm for the immediately preceding year prior to any increase or decrease for undermarketing or overmarketing by the farm yield. If on account of excess marketings in the preceding marketing year the farm marketing quota for the marketing year is reduced to zero pounds without reflecting the entire reduction required, the additional reduction required shall be made for the subsequent marketing year or years. The farm marketing quota will be increased or decreased for the second succeeding marketing year in the case of Maryland tobacco, and for any other kind of tobacco for which the Secretary determines it is impracticable because of the lack of adequate marketing data, to make the increases or decreases applicable to the immediately succeeding marketing year.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the proclamation of the national marketing quota for the 1986 crop of Flue-cured tobacco may be made not later than December 31, 1985. The Secretary, in his discretion, may proclaim the quota on an acreage-poundage basis as provided in this section or on an acreage allotment basis, whichever he determines would result in a more effective marketing quota for that kind of tobacco, and shall conduct a referendum in accordance with the provisions of section 1312(c) of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence or section 1312(c) of this title, the referendum with respect to national marketing quotas for Flue-cured tobacco for the 1986 through 1988 marketing years may be conducted not later than the earlier of (1) thirty days after any proclamation of the national marketing quota for Flue-cured tobacco for the 1986 marketing year made after January 30, 1986, or (2) March 15, 1986. If the Secretary determines that more than one-third of the farmers voting oppose the national marketing quotas the results shall be proclaimed and the national marketing quota so proclaimed shall not be in effect. If the Secretary proclaims the quotas on an acreage-poundage basis he shall determine and proclaim at the same time the national marketing quota, national acreage allotment, and national average yield goal for the first year of the three years for which quotas are proclaimed. Notice of the farm marketing quota which will be in effect for his farm for the first marketing year covered by the referendum insofar as practicable shall be mailed to the farm operator prior to the holding of any special referendum under subsection (b) of this section or a referendum on acreage-poundage quotas under this subsection, and at least 15 days prior to the holding of any special referendum under subsection (c) of this section. The Secretary shall determine and announce the national marketing quota, national acreage allotment and national average yield goal for the second and third marketing years of any three-year period for which national marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis are in effect on or before the December 15 with respect to Flue-cured tobacco and the March 1 with respect to other kinds of tobacco immediately preceding the beginning of the marketing year to which they apply. Whenever a national marketing quota, national acreage allotment, and national average yield goal are determined and announced, the Secretary shall provide for the determination of farm acreage allotments and farm marketing quotas under the provisions of this section for the crop and marketing year covered by the determinations. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the 1986 marketing year, the Secretary shall proclaim the national marketing quota for Flue-cured tobacco not later than 21 days after April 7, 1986. Any proclamation with respect to the national marketing quota for the 1986 mar<!-- PDFPage:518 -->keting year for Flue-cured tobacco made by the Secretary prior to April 7, 1986, shall become void on April 7, 1986.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No farm acreage allotment or farm yield shall be established for a farm on which no tobacco was produced or considered produced under applicable provisions of law for the immediately preceding five years. For each marketing year for which acreage-poundage quotas are in effect under this section the Secretary in his discretion may establish a reserve from the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 3 per centum of the national acreage allotment to be available for making corrections of errors in farm acreage allotments, adjusting inequities, and for establishing acreage allotments for new farms, which are farms on which tobacco was not produced or considered produced during the immediately preceding five years (except that not less than two-thirds of such reserve shall be for new farms). The part of the reserve held for apportionment to new farms shall be allotted on the basis of land, labor, and equipment available for the production of tobacco, crop rotation practices, soil and other physical factors affecting the production of tobacco and the past tobacco-producing experience of the farm operator.

The acreage reductions required under the last two sentences shall be in addition to any other adjustments made pursuant to this section, and when acreage reductions are made the farm marketing quota shall be reduced to reflect such reductions. The provisions of the next to the last sentence of such subsection pertaining to the filing of any false report with respect to the acreage of tobacco grown on the farm shall also be applicable to the filing of any false report with respect to the production or marketings of tobacco grown on a farm for which an acreage allotment and a farm yield are established as provided in this section. In establishing acreage allotments and farm yields for other farms owned by the owner displaced by acquisition of his land by any agency, as provided in section 1378 of this title, increases or decreases in such acreage allotments and farm yields as provided in this section shall be made on account of marketings below or in excess of the farm marketing quota for the farm acquired by the agency. Acreage allotments and farm marketing quotas determined under this section may (except in the case of kinds of tobacco not subject to section 1314b of this title) be leased and sold under the terms and conditions contained in section 1314b of this title, except that (1) the adjustment provided for in the last sentence of subsection (c) of said section shall be based on farm yields rather than normal yields, and (2) any credit for undermarketing or charge for overmarketing shall be attributed to the farm to which transferred. Transfers of acreage allotments for 1965 under section 1314b of this title on the basis of leases executed prior to the effective date of a program for the 1965 crop of Flue-cured tobacco under this section may be approved or ratified by the county committee for the purposes of this section, but the amount of allotment transferred shall be increased or decreased in the same proportion that the allotment of the farm from which it is transferred is increased or decreased under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Proclamations and referenda regarding burley tobacco</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall, within thirty days following April 14, 1971, proclaim national marketing quotas for burley tobacco for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1971, and determine and announce the amount of the marketing quota for burley tobacco for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1971, as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of the farmers engaged in the production of the 1970 crop of burley tobacco to determine whether they favor or oppose the establishment of farm marketing quotas on a poundage basis as provided in this section for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1971. If the Secretary determines that two-thirds or more of the farmers voting in such referendum approve marketing quotas on a poundage basis, marketing quotas as provided in this section shall be in effect for those three marketing years. If marketing quotas on a poundage basis are not approved by at least two-thirds of the farmers voting in such referendum, no marketing quotas or price support for burley tobacco shall be in effect for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1971. Thereafter, the provisions of section 1312 of this title shall apply: <em>Provided</em>, That national marketing quotas for burley tobacco for any marketing year subsequent to the marketing year beginning October 1, 1971, shall be proclaimed as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall determine and announce, not later than the February 1 preceding the second and third marketing years of any three-year period for which marketing quotas on a poundage basis are in effect for burley tobacco under this section, the amount of the national marketing quota for each of such years. If marketing quotas have been made effective on a poundage basis for burley tobacco under this section, the Secretary shall, not later than February 1 of the last year of three consecutive marketing years for which marketing quotas are in effect for burley tobacco under this section, proclaim national marketing quotas for burley tobacco for the next three succeeding marketing years as provided in this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the proclamation of national marketing quotas for Burley tobacco for the 1986 through 1988 marketing years may be made not later than March 1, 1986. Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum in accordance with section 1312(c) of this title. If the Secretary determines that more than one-third of the farmers voting oppose the national marketing quotas, he shall announce the results and no marketing quotas or price support shall be in effect for burley tobacco for the first marketing year of such three-year period. Thereafter, the provisions of section 1312 of this title shall apply: <em>Provided</em>, That the national marketing quota and farm marketing quotas shall be determined for burley tobacco as provided in this section. Notice of the farm marketing quota which will be in effect for his farm for the first marketing year covered by any referendum under this section shall, insofar as practicable, be mailed to the farm operator in sufficient time to be received prior to the referendum. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the 1986 marketing year, the Secretary shall proclaim the national marketing quota for Burley tobacco not later than 21 days after April 7, 1986, or February 1, 1986, whichever is later. Any proclamation with respect to the national marketing quota for the 1986 marketing year for Burley tobacco made by the Secretary prior to April 7, 1986, shall become void on April 7, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proclamations and referenda regarding dark air-cured tobacco and types 22 and 23 fire-cured tobacco</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall, not later than February 1, 1983, proclaim national marketing quotas for dark air-cured tobacco and for fire-cured tobacco, types 22 and 23 (hereinafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;fire-cured tobacco&rdquo;) for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1983, and determine and announce the amount of the marketing quota for dark air-cured and for fire-cured tobacco for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1983, as provided in this section. Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of the farmers engaged in the production of the 1982 crop of each of such kinds of tobacco to determine whether they favor or oppose the establishment of farm marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco as provided in this section for the three marketing years be<!-- PDFPage:523 -->ginning October 1, 1983, in lieu of quotas on an acreage basis in effect for the two marketing years beginning October 1, 1983. If the Secretary determines that one-half or more of the farmers voting in such referendum approve marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco, then marketing quotas as provided in this section shall be in effect for such kind of tobacco for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1983, and marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall cease to be in effect for such kind of tobacco for the two marketing years beginning on October 1, 1983. If marketing quotas on a poundage basis are not approved for such kind of tobacco by at least one-half of the farmers voting in such referendum, then quotas on an acreage basis shall be in effect for such kind of tobacco for the two marketing years beginning October 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If marketing quotas on an acreage basis are in effect for any such kind of tobacco, if, for a period of not less than three marketing years, a referendum has not been held under this section to determine whether producers of such kind of tobacco favor marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco, and if the Secretary, after conducting public hearings in the area in which such kind of tobacco is produced, ascertains that producers and other interested persons favor marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco, then the Secretary shall, at the time of the next announcement of the amount of the national marketing quota, announce national marketing quotas for the next three succeeding marketing years under this section. Within thirty days of such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of farmers engaged in the production of the most recent crop of such kind of tobacco to determine whether they favor the establishment of marketing quotas on a poundage basis for such kind of tobacco as provided in this section for the next three succeeding marketing years. If the Secretary determines that more than one-half of the farmers voting in such referendum approve marketing quotas on a poundage basis under this section, then quotas on that basis shall be in effect for the next three succeeding marketing years and the marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall cease to be in effect at the beginning of such three-year period. If marketing quotas on a poundage basis are not approved by more than one-half of the farmers voting in such referendum, then the marketing quotas on an acreage basis shall continue in effect as theretofore proclaimed under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall determine and announce, not later than the March 1 preceding the second and third marketing years of any three-year period for which marketing quotas on a poundage basis are in effect for any such kind of tobacco under this section, the amount of the national marketing quota for such kind of tobacco for each of such years. If marketing quotas on a poundage basis have been made effective for such kind of tobacco under this section, then the Secretary shall, not later than March 1 of the last of three consecutive marketing years for which marketing quotas are in effect for such kind of tobacco under this section, proclaim a national marketing quota for such kind of tobacco for the next three succeeding marketing years as provided in this section. The Secretary shall conduct extensive hearings in the area in which such kind of tobacco is produced to ascertain whether producers favor marketing quotas on an acreage basis or on a poundage basis and shall proclaim the quota on the basis he determines most producers of such kind of tobacco favor. Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum in accordance with section 1312(c) of this title. If more than one-half of the farmers voting in such referendum oppose the national marketing quotas, then the Secretary shall announce the results and no marketing quotas or price support shall be in effect for such kind of tobacco and the national marketing quota so proclaimed shall not be in effect for the next three succeeding marketing years. Thereafter the provisions of section 1312 of this title shall apply: <em>Provided</em>, That the national marketing quota and farm marketing quotas for such kind of tobacco shall be determined for such kind of tobacco as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of national marketing quota, determination; national reserve, establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the national marketing quota determined under this section for any kind of tobacco for which poundage quotas may be established for any marketing year shall be the amount of such kind of tobacco produced in the United States which the Secretary estimates will be utilized in the United States and will be exported during such marketing year, adjusted upward or downward in such amount as the Secretary, in his discretion, determines is desirable for the purpose of maintaining an adequate supply or for effecting an orderly reduction of supplies to the reserve supply level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For each marketing year for which marketing quotas are in effect for a kind of tobacco under this section, the Secretary in his discretion may establish a reserve with respect to such kind of tobacco (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;national reserve&rdquo;) from the national marketing quota for such kind of tobacco in an amount not in excess of 1 per centum of such national marketing quota to be available for making corrections and adjusting inequities in farm marketing quotas, and for establishing marketing quotas for new farms (that is, farms for which farm marketing quotas are not otherwise established).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For the 1986 and each subsequent crop of Burley tobacco, the national marketing quota for any marketing year shall be the quantity of Burley tobacco, as determined by the Secretary, that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Farm yields; determination; limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a national marketing quota is first proclaimed for a kind of tobacco under this section, the Secretary shall through local committees determine a farm yield for each farm for which an acreage allotment for such kind of tobacco was established for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970, in the case of burley tobacco, and for the previous marketing year, in the case of dark air-cured tobacco and fire-cured tobacco. Such yield shall be determined by averaging the yield per acre for the four highest years of the five consecutive years beginning with the 1966 crop year, in the case of burley tobacco, and the immediately preceding 5 crop years, in the case of dark air-cured tobacco and fire-cured tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That if the kind of tobacco involved was produced on the farm in fewer than five of such years, the farm yield shall be the simple average of the yields obtained in the years during such period that such kind of tobacco was produced on the farm: <em>Provided further</em>, That if no such kind of tobacco was produced on the farm but the farm was considered as having planted such kind of tobacco during the immediately preceding five years, the farm yield will be appraised on the basis of the yields established for similar farms in the area on which such kind of tobacco was produced during such five-year period: <em>And provided further</em>, That the farm yield established for any farm shall not exceed three thousand five hundred pounds per acre, in the case of burley tobacco, and three thousand pounds per acre, in the case of dark air-cured tobacco and fire-cured tobacco: <em>And provided further</em>, That, when a marketing quota program for dark air-cured tobacco or for fire-cured tobacco is first established under this section, farm yields so determined with respect to dark air-cured tobacco or fire-cured tobacco, as the case may be, shall be adjusted proportionately so that the weighted average of such farm yields is equal to the national average yield goal for dark air-cured tobacco or fire-cured tobacco, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Farm marketing quotas; preliminary quotas, determination, limitation; succeeding years, quota computation, limitations, increase and reduction of quotas; new farms, limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A preliminary farm marketing quota shall be determined for each farm for which a burley tobacco acreage allotment was established for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970, by multiplying the farm yield determined under subsection (d) of this section by the farm acreage allotment (prior to any reduction for violation of regulations issued pursuant to the chapter) established for such farm for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970. A preliminary farm marketing quota shall be determined for each farm for which a dark air-cured tobacco or fire-cured tobacco acreage allotment was established for the previous marketing year, by multiplying the farm yield determined under such subsection by the farm acreage allotment (prior to any such reduction) established for such farm for the previous marketing year. For each farm for which such a preliminary farm marketing quota is determined, a farm marketing quota for the first year shall be determined by multiplying the preliminary farm marketing quota by a national factor obtained by dividing the national marketing quota determined under subsection (c) of this section (less the national reserve) by the sum of all preliminary farm marketing quotas as determined under this subsection: <em>Provided</em>, That such national factor shall not be less than 95 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The farm marketing quota for each succeeding year shall be determined by multiplying the previous year's farm marketing quota by a national factor obtained by dividing the national market<!-- PDFPage:525 -->ing quota determined under subsection (c) of this section (less the national reserve) by the sum of the farm marketing quotas for the immediately preceding year for all farms for which marketing quotas for the kind of tobacco involved will be determined for such succeeding marketing year: <em>Provided</em>, That, except in the case of Burley tobacco, such national factor shall not be less than 90 per centum: <em>Provided further</em>, That for the marketing years beginning October 1, 1972, and October 1, 1973, the farm marketing quota for any farm shall not be less than the smaller of (1) one-half acre times the farm yield times one-half the sum of the figure one and the national factor for the current year, or (2) the farm marketing quota for the immediately preceding marketing year times one-half the sum of the figure one and the national factor for the current year. The farm marketing quota so computed for any farm for any year shall be increased by the number of pounds by which marketings from the farm during the immediately preceding year were less than the farm marketing quota (after adjustments): <em>Provided</em>, That any such increase shall not exceed the amount of the farm marketing quota (including leased pounds) for the immediately preceding marketing year prior to any increase for undermarketings or decrease for overmarketings. The farm marketing quota so computed for each farm for any year shall be reduced by the number of pounds by which marketing from the farm during the immediately preceding year exceeded the farm marketing quota (after adjustments): <em>Provided</em>, That if, on account of excess marketings in the preceding year, the farm marketing quota is reduced to zero pounds without reflecting the entire reduction required, the additional reduction required shall be made in subsequent marketing years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The farm marketing quota for a new farm shall be the number of pounds determined by the county committee with approval of the State committee to be fair and reasonable for the farm on the basis of the past experience of the farm operator with respect to the kind of tobacco involved: the land, labor, and equipment available for the production of such kind of tobacco; crop rotation practices, and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of such kind of tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That the farm marketing quota for any such new farm shall not exceed 50 per centum of the average of the farm marketing quotas for similar farms for which farm marketing quotas are otherwise established: <em>Provided further</em>, That the number of pounds allocated to all new farms shall not exceed that portion of the national reserve provided by the Secretary for establishing quotas for new farms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reductions for false information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a poundage program is in effect for any kind of tobacco under this section, the farm marketing quota next established for any farm shall be reduced by the amount of such kind of tobacco produced on any farm (1) which is marketed as having been produced on a different farm; (2) for which proof of disposition is not furnished as required by the Secretary; and (3) as to which any producer on the farm files, or aids or acquiesces in the filing of, any false report with respect to the production or marketings of tobacco: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary through the local committee finds that no person connected with such farm caused, aided, or acquiesced in any such irregularity, the next established farm marketing quota shall not be reduced under this subsection. The reductions required under this subsection shall be in addition to any other adjustments made pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Leases and transfers of farm quotas; limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When a poundage program is in effect for any kind of tobacco under this section, farm marketing quotas (after adjustments) for such kind of tobacco may be leased and transferred to other farms in the same county under the terms and conditions contained in section 1314d of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That such leases and transfers shall be on a pound for pound basis: <em>Provided further</em>, That any adjustment for undermarketings or overmarketings shall be attributed to the farm to which leased and transferred: <em>Provided further</em>, That not more than thirty thousand pounds of Burley tobacco quota may be leased and transferred to any farm under this section: <em>Provided further</em>, That a lease and transfer of Burley tobacco quota shall not be effective for any crop year unless a record of the transfer is filed with the county committee not later than July 1 of that crop year or, if such record of the transfer is filed with the county committee after July 1, the county committee determines with the concurrence of the State committee that all interested parties agreed to such lease and transfer before July 1 and that the failure to file such record of the transfer did not result from gross negligence on the part of any party to such lease and transfer: <em>And provided further</em>, That the marketing quota determined for any farm subsequent to such lease and transfer shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the farm yield established under subsection (d) of this section by 50 per centum of the acreage of cropland in the farm.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Effective for the 1991 and subsequent crop years, the Secretary may, during any one year, and subject to such rules as the Secretary deems appropriate, permit the sale of a burley tobacco quota from one farm to another farm in the same county if the buyer, who is an active burley tobacco producer, is not buying an amount larger than 30 percent of the existing quota for the buyer's farm, or 20,000 pounds whichever is greater. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;active burley tobacco producer&rdquo; means any person who shared in the risk of producing a crop of burley tobacco in not less than one of the three years preceding the year involved, or any person who certified to the Secretary, in such form and manner as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe, their intent to become an active burley tobacco producer. A person shall be considered to have shared in the risk of producing a crop of burley tobacco if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the investment of such person in the production of such crop is not less than 20 percent of the proceeds of the sale of such crop;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:526 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the investment of such person's return on such investment is dependent solely on the sale price of such crop; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such person may not receive any of such return before the sale of such crop.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No sale of burley tobacco quota from a farm shall be permitted, under paragraph (2), if any sale of quota to the same farm has been made within the three immediately preceding crop years. A sale of burley tobacco quota shall not be effective for a crop year unless a record of the sale is filed with the county committee not later than July 1 of the crop year. The marketing quota determined for any farm subsequent to such sale shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the farm yield established under subsection (d) of this section by 50 percent of the acreage of cropland in the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Loss of quotas through underplanting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Effective with the marketing year beginning October 1, 1994, no marketing quota, other than a new farm marketing quota, shall be established for a farm on which no burley tobacco was planted or considered planted in any two of the three years immediately preceding the year for which farm marketing quotas are being established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Marketing penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When marketing quotas under this section are in effect, provisions with respect to penalties for the marketing of excess tobacco and the other provisions contained in section 1314 of this title shall apply, except that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No penalty on excess tobacco shall be due or collected until 103 per centum of the farm marketing quota (after adjustments) for a farm has been marketed, but with respect to each pound of tobacco marketed in excess of such percentage the full penalty rate shall be due, payable, and collected at the time of marketing on each pound of tobacco marketed, and any tobacco marketed in excess of 100 per centum of the farm marketing quota (after adjustments) will require a reduction in subsequent farm marketing quotas in accordance with subsection (e) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary, in his discretion, determines it is desirable to encourage additional marketings of any grades of the kind of tobacco involved during any marketing year to insure traditional market patterns to meet the normal demands of export and domestic markets, he may authorize the marketing of such grades without the payment of penalty or deduction from subsequent quotas to the extent of 5 per centum of the farm marketing quota for the farm on which the tobacco was produced, and such marketings shall be eligible for price support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions with respect to penalties contained in the third sentence of section 1314(a) of this title shall be revised to read: &ldquo;If any producer falsely identifies or fails to account for the disposition of any tobacco, the Secretary, in lieu of assessing and collecting penalties based on actual marketings of excess tobacco, may elect to assess a penalty computed by multiplying the full penalty rate by an amount of tobacco equal to 25 per centum of the farm marketing quota (after adjustments) and the penalty in respect thereof shall be paid and remitted by the producer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions contained in the fourth sentence of section 1314(a) of this title shall not be applicable. For the first year a marketing quota program established under the provisions of this section is in effect with respect to burley tobacco, the farm marketing quota determined under the provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall receive a temporary upward adjustment equal to the amount of carryover penalty-free burley tobacco for the farm. For subsequent years, the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he considers necessary for carrying out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Lease and transfer of burley tobacco quota assigned</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may permit, after July 1 of any crop year, the lease and transfer of burley tobacco quota assigned to a farm if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the planted acreage of burley tobacco on the farm to which the quota is assigned is determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to produce the effective farm marketing quota under average conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the farm's expected production of burley tobacco is less than 80 percent of the farm's effective marketing quota as a result of a natural disaster condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any lease and transfer of quota under this subsection may be made to any other farm within the same State in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Lease and transfer of burley tobacco quotas in Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may permit the lease and transfer of a burley tobacco quota from one farm in a State to any other farm in the State if a majority of active burley tobacco producers within the State approve such lease and transfer by a state-wide referendum to be conducted by the Secretary. This subsection shall apply only to the States of Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A domestic manufacturer of cigarettes described in subsection (b) of this section shall purchase from the inventories of the producer-owned cooperative marketing associations for Burley tobacco described in section 1314h(a)(2) of this title, at the applicable list price published by the association, the quantity of tobacco described in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (3), the quantity of Burley tobacco required to be purchased by a manufacturer during a calendar year under this subsection shall equal 1/2 of the quantity of imported tobacco used by the manufacturer to produce cigarettes during the preceding calendar year that exceeds 25 percent of the quantity of all tobacco used by the manufacturer to produce cigarettes during the preceding calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary, in consultation with producer-owned cooperative marketing associations, determines that because of drought, insect or disease infestation, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of producers, the total quantity of a crop of domestic Burley tobacco or Flue-cured tobacco that is harvested and suitable for marketing is substantially less than the expected yield for the crop, and that pool inventories for the kind of tobacco involved have been depleted, effective for the calendar year following the year in which the crop loss occurs, the Secretary may reduce the minimum percentage of domestic tobacco specified in subsection (a) of this section to a percentage below 75 percent, as determined by the Secretary, that reflects the reduced availability of domestic supplies of the kind of tobacco involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of expected yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine the expected yield for a crop of Burley tobacco or Flue-cured tobacco by taking into consideration&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1321. Legislative finding of effect on interstate and foreign commerce and necessity of regulation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Corn is a basic source of food for the Nation, and corn produced in the commercial corn-producing area moves almost wholly in interstate and foreign commerce in the form of corn, livestock, and livestock products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Abnormally excessive and abnormally deficient supplies of corn acutely and directly affect, burden, and obstruct interstate and foreign commerce in corn, livestock, and livestock products. When abnormally excessive supplies exist, transportation facilities in interstate and foreign commerce are overtaxed, and the handling and processing facilities through which the flow of interstate and foreign commerce in corn, livestock, and livestock products is directed become acutely congested. Abnormally deficient supplies result in substantial decreases in livestock production and in an inadequate flow of livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce, with the consequence of unreasonably high prices to consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Violent fluctuations from year to year in the available supply of corn disrupt the balance between the supply of livestock and livestock products moving in interstate and foreign commerce and the supply of corn available for feeding. When available supplies of corn are excessive, corn prices are low and farmers overexpand livestock production in order to find outlets for corn. Such expansion, together with the relative scarcity and high price of corn, forces farmers to market abnormally excessive supplies of livestock in interstate commerce at sacrifice prices, endangering the financial stability of producers, and overtaxing handling and processing facilities through which the flow of interstate and foreign commerce in livestock and livestock products is directed. Such excessive marketings deplete livestock on farms, and livestock marketed in interstate and foreign commerce consequently becomes abnormally low, with resultant high prices to consumers and danger to the financial stability of persons engaged in transporting, handling, and processing livestock in interstate and foreign commerce. These high prices in turn result in another overexpansion of livestock production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Recurring violent fluctuations in the price of corn resulting from corresponding violent fluctuations in the supply of corn directly affect the movement of livestock in interstate commerce from the range cattle regions to the regions where livestock is fattened for market in interstate and foreign commerce, and also directly affect the movement in interstate commerce of corn marketed as corn which is transported from the regions where produced to the regions where livestock is fattened for market in interstate and foreign commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Substantially all the corn moving in interstate commerce, substantially all the corn fed to livestock transported in interstate commerce for fattening, and substantially all the corn fed to livestock marketed in interstate and foreign commerce, is produced in the commercial corn-producing area. Substantially all the corn produced in the commercial corn-producing area, <!-- PDFPage:535 -->with the exception of a comparatively small amount used for farm consumption, is either sold or transported in interstate commerce, or is fed to livestock transported in interstate commerce for feeding, or is fed to livestock marketed in interstate and foreign commerce. Almost all the corn produced outside the commercial corn-producing area is either consumed, or is fed to livestock which is consumed, in the State in which such corn is produced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The conditions affecting the production and marketing of corn and the livestock products of corn are such that, without Federal assistance, farmers, individually or in cooperation, cannot effectively prevent the recurrence of disparities between the supplies of livestock moving in interstate and foreign commerce and the supply of corn available for feeding, and provide for orderly marketing of corn in interstate and foreign commerce and livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The national public interest requires that the burdens on interstate and foreign commerce above described be removed by the exercise of Federal power. By reason of the administrative and physical impracticability of regulating the movement of livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce and the inadequacy of any such regulation to remove such burdens, such power can be feasibly exercised only by providing for the withholding from market of excessive and burdensome supplies of corn in times of excessive production, and providing a reserve supply of corn available for market in times of deficient production, in order that a stable and continuous flow of livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce may at all times be assured and maintained.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1331. Legislative finding of effect on interstate and foreign commerce and necessity of regulation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Wheat is a basic source of food for the Nation, is produced throughout the United States by more than a million farmers, is sold on the country-wide market and, as wheat or flour, flows almost entirely through instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce from producers to consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Abnormally excessive and abnormally deficient supplies of wheat on the country-wide market acutely and directly affect, burden, and obstruct interstate and foreign commerce. Abnormally excessive supplies overtax the facilities of interstate and foreign transportation, congest terminal markets and milling centers in the flow of wheat from producers to consumers, depress the price of wheat in interstate and foreign commerce, and otherwise disrupt the orderly marketing of such commodity in such commerce. Abnormally deficient supplies result in an inadequate flow of wheat and its products in interstate and foreign commerce with consequent injurious effects to the instrumentalities of such commerce and with excessive increases in the prices of wheat and its products in interstate and foreign commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It is in the interest of the general welfare that interstate and foreign commerce in wheat and its products be protected from such burdensome surpluses and distressing shortages, and that a supply of wheat be maintained which is adequate to meet domestic consumption and export requirements in years of drought, flood, and other adverse conditions as well as in years of plenty, and that the soil resources of the Nation be not wasted in the production of such burdensome surpluses. Such surpluses result in disastrously low prices of wheat and other grains to wheat producers, destroy the purchasing power of grain producers for industrial products, and reduce the value of the agricultural assets supporting the national credit structure. Such shortages of wheat result in unreasonably high prices of flour and bread to consumers and loss of market outlets by wheat producers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The conditions affecting the production and marketing of wheat are such that, without Federal assistance, farmers, individually or in cooperation, cannot effectively prevent the recurrence of such surpluses and shortages and the burdens on interstate and foreign commerce resulting therefrom, maintain normal supplies of wheat, or provide for the orderly marketing thereof in interstate and foreign commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Wheat which is planted and not disposed of prior to the date prescribed by the Secretary for the disposal of excess acres of wheat is an addition to the total supply of wheat and has a direct effect on the price of wheat in interstate and foreign commerce and may also affect the supply and price of livestock and livestock products. In the circumstances, wheat not disposed of prior to such date must be considered in the same manner as mechanically harvested wheat in order to achieve the policy of the chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The diversion of substantial acreages from wheat to the production of commodities which are in surplus supply or which will be in surplus supply if they are permitted to be grown on the diverted acreage would burden, obstruct, and adversely affect interstate and foreign commerce in such commodities, and would adversely affect the prices of such commodities in interstate and foreign commerce. Small changes in the supply of a commodity could create a sufficient surplus to affect seriously the price of such commodity in interstate and foreign commerce. Large changes in the supply of such commodity could have a more acute effect on the price of the commodity in interstate and foreign commerce and, also, could overtax the handling, processing, and transportation facilities through which the flow of interstate and foreign commerce in such commodity is directed. Such adverse effects caused by overproduction in one year could further result in a deficient supply of the commodity in the succeeding year, causing excessive increases in the price of the commodity in inter<!-- PDFPage:537 -->state and foreign commerce in such year. It is, therefore, necessary to prevent acreage diverted from the production of wheat to be used to produce commodities which are in surplus supply or which will be in surplus supply if they are permitted to be grown on the diverted acreage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this subpart affording a cooperative plan to wheat producers are necessary in order to minimize recurring surpluses and shortages of wheat in interstate and foreign commerce, to provide for the maintenance of adequate reserve supplies thereof, to provide for an adequate and orderly flow of wheat and its products in interstate and foreign commerce at prices which are fair and reasonable to farmers and consumers, and to prevent acreage diverted from the production of wheat from adversely affecting other commodities in interstate and foreign commerce.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1332. National marketing quota</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Proclamation; duration of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever prior to April 15 in any calendar year the Secretary determines that the total supply of wheat in the marketing year beginning in the next succeeding calendar year will, in the absence of a marketing quota program, likely be excessive, the Secretary shall proclaim that a national marketing quota for wheat shall be in effect for such marketing year and for either the following marketing year or the following two marketing years, if the Secretary determines and declares in such proclamation that a two- or three-year marketing quota program is necessary to effectuate the policy of the chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount; minimum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a national marketing quota for wheat has been proclaimed for any marketing year, the Secretary shall determine and proclaim the amount of the national marketing quota for such marketing year not earlier than January 1 or later than April 15 of the calendar year preceding the year in which such marketing year begins. The amount of the national marketing quota for wheat for any marketing year shall be an amount of wheat which the Secretary estimates (i) will be utilized during such marketing year for human consumption in the United States as food, food products, and beverages, composed wholly or partly of wheat, (ii) will be utilized during such marketing year in the United States for seed, (iii) will be exported either in the form of wheat or products thereof, and (iv) will be utilized during such marketing year in the United States as livestock (including poultry) feed, excluding the estimated quantity of wheat which will be utilized for such purpose as a result of the substitution of wheat for feed grains under section 1339c of this title; less (A) an amount of wheat equal to the estimated imports of wheat into the United States during such marketing year and, (B) if the stocks of wheat owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation are determined by the Secretary to be excessive, an amount of wheat determined by the Secretary to be a desirable reduction in such marketing year in such stocks to achieve the policy of the chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary determines that the total stocks of wheat in the Nation are insufficient to assure an adequate carryover for the next succeeding marketing year, the national marketing quota otherwise determined shall be increased by the amount the Secretary determines to be necessary to assure an adequate carryover: <em>And provided further</em>, That the national marketing quota for wheat for any marketing year shall be not less than one billion bushels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) National emergencies or material increase in demand; investigation; increase or termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after the proclamation of a national marketing quota for wheat for any marketing year, the Secretary has reason to believe that, because of a national emergency or because of a <!-- PDFPage:538 -->material increase in the demand for wheat, the national marketing quota should be terminated or the amount thereof increased, he shall cause an immediate investigation to be made to determine whether such action is necessary in order to meet such emergency or increase in the demand for wheat. If, on the basis of such investigation, the Secretary finds that such action is necessary, he shall immediately proclaim such finding and the amount of any such increase found by him to be necessary and thereupon such national marketing quota shall be so increased or terminated. In case any national marketing quota is increased under this subsection, the Secretary shall provide for such increase by increasing acreage allotments established under this subpart by a uniform percentage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Farm marketing quotas for wheat crops planted in calendar years 1966&ndash;1970</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall proclaim a national marketing quota for the crops of wheat planted for harvest in the calendar years 1966 through 1970, and farm marketing quotas shall not be in effect for such crops of wheat.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1334. Apportionment of national acreage allotment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Apportionment among States; special acreage reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national allotment for wheat, less a reserve of not to exceed 1 per centum thereof for apportionment as provided in this subsection and less the special acreage reserve provided for in this subsection, shall be apportioned by the Secretary among the States on the basis of the preceding year's allotment for each such State, including all amounts allotted to the State and including for 1967 the increased acreage in the State allotted for 1966 under section 1335 of this title, adjusted to the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary to establish a fair and equitable apportionment base for each State, taking into consideration established crop rotation practices, estimated decrease in farm allotments because of loss of history, and other relevant factors. The reserve acreage set aside herein for apportionment by the Secretary shall be used (1) to make allotments to counties in addition to the county allotments made under subsection (b) of this section, on the basis of the relative needs of counties for additional allotments because of reclamation and other new areas coming into production of wheat, or (2) to increase the allotment for any county, in which wheat is the principal grain crop produced, on the basis of its relative need for such increase if the average ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on old wheat farms in such county is less by at least 20 per centum than such average ratio on old wheat farms in an adjoining county or counties in which wheat is the principal grain crop produced or if there is a definable contiguous area consisting of at least 10 per centum of the cropland acreage in such county in which the average ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on old wheat farms is less by at least 20 per centum than such average ratio on the remaining old wheat farms in such county, provided that such low ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland is due to the shift prior to 1951 from wheat to one or more alternative income-producing crops which, because of plant disease or sustained loss of markets, may no longer be produced at a fair profit and there is no other alternative income-producing crop suitable for production in the area or county. The increase in the county allotment under clause (2) of the preceding sentence shall be used to increase allotments for old wheat farms in the affected area to make such allotments comparable with those on similar farms in adjoining areas or counties but the average ratio of increased allotments to cropland on such farms shall not exceed the average ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on old wheat farms in the adjoining areas or counties. There also shall be made available a special acreage reserve of not in excess of one million acres as determined by the Secretary to be desirable for the purposes hereof which shall be in addition to the national acreage reserve provided for in this subsection. Such special acreage reserve shall be made available to the States to make additional allotments to counties on the basis of the relative needs of counties, as determined by the Secretary, for additional allotments to make adjustments in the allotments on old wheat farms (that is, farms on which wheat has been seeded or regarded as seeded to one or more of the three crops immediately preceding the crop for which the allotment is established) on which the ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on the farm is less than one-half the average ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on old wheat farms in the county. Such adjustments shall not provide an allotment for any farm which would result in an allotment-cropland ratio for the farm in excess of one-half of such county average ratio and the total of such adjustments in any county shall not exceed the acreage made available therefor in the county. Such apportionment from the special acreage reserve shall be made only to counties where wheat is a major income-producing crop, only to farms on which there is limited opportunity for the production of an alternative income-producing crop, and only if an efficient farming operation on the farm requires the allotment of additional acreage from the special acreage reserve. For the purposes of making adjustments hereunder the cropland on the farm shall not include any land developed as cropland subsequent to the 1963 crop year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Apportionment among counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State acreage allotment for wheat, less a reserve of not to exceed 3 per centum thereof for apportionment as provided in subsection (c) of this section, shall be apportioned by the Secretary among the counties in the State, on the basis of the preceding year's wheat allotment in each such county, including for 1967 the increased acreage in the county allotted for 1966 pursuant to section 1335 of this title, adjusted to the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary in order to establish a fair and equitable apportionment base for each county, taking into consideration established crop rotation practices, estimated decrease in farm allotments because of loss of history, and other relevant factors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Apportionment among farms; overplanted allotments; reductions; notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The allotment to the county shall be apportioned by the Secretary, through the local committees, among the farms within the county on the basis of past acreage of wheat, tillable acres, crop-rotation practices, type of soil, and topography. Not more than 3 per centum of the State allotment shall be apportioned to farms on which wheat has not been planted during any of the three marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year in which the allotment is made. For the purpose of establishing farm acreage allotments&mdash;(i) the past acreage of wheat on any farm for 1958 or 1965 shall be the base acreage determined for the farm under the regulations issued by the Secretary for determining 1958 or 1965 farm wheat acreage allotments; (ii) if subsequent to the determination of <!-- PDFPage:541 -->such base acreage the 1958 or 1965 wheat acreage allotment for the farm is increased through administrative, review, or court proceedings, the 1958 or 1965 farm base acreage shall be increased in the same proportion; and (iii) the past acreage of wheat for 1959 and any subsequent year except 1965 shall be the wheat acreage on the farm which is not in excess of the farm wheat acreage allotment, plus, in the case wheat acreage on the farm which is not in excess of wheat acreage allotment, the acreage diverted under such wheat allotment programs: <em>Provided</em>, That for 1959 and subsequent years in the case of any farm on which the entire amount of the farm marketing excess is delivered to the Secretary or stored in accordance with applicable regulations to avoid or postpone payment of the penalty, the past acreage of wheat for the year in which such farm marketing excess is so delivered or stored shall be the farm base acreage of wheat determined for the farm under the regulations issued by the Secretary for determining farm wheat acreage allotments for such year, but if any part of the amount of wheat so stored is later depleted and penalty becomes due by reason of such depletion, for the purpose of establishing farm wheat acreage allotments subsequent to such depletion the past acreage of wheat for the farm for the year in which the excess was produced shall be reduced to the farm wheat acreage allotment for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each old or new farm acreage allotment for the 1962 crop of wheat as determined on the basis of a minimum national acreage allotment of fifty-five million acres shall be reduced by 10 per centum. In the event notices of farm acreage allotments for the 1962 crop of wheat have been mailed to farm operators prior to the effective date of this subparagraph (2), new notices showing the required reduction shall be mailed to farm operators as soon as practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the past acreage of wheat for 1967 and any subsequent year shall be the acreage of wheat planted, plus the acreage regarded as planted, for harvest as grain on the farm which is not in excess of the farm acreage allotment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (c), the farm acreage allotment for the 1967 and any subsequent crop of wheat shall be established for each old farm by apportioning the county wheat acreage allotment among farms in the county on which wheat has been planted, or is considered to have been planted, for harvest as grain in any one of the three years immediately preceding the year for which allotments are determined on the basis of past acreage of wheat and the farm acreage allotment for the year immediately preceding the year for which the allotment is being established, adjusted as hereinafter provided. For purposes of this paragraph, the acreage allotment for the immediately preceding year may be adjusted to reflect established crop-rotation practices, may be adjusted downward to reflect a reduction in the tillable acreage on the farm, and may be adjusted upward to reflect such other factors as the Secretary determines should be considered for the purpose of establishing a fair and equitable allotment: <em>Provided</em>, That (i) for the purposes of computing the allotment for any year, the acreage allotment for the farm for the immediately preceding year shall be decreased by 7 per centum if for the year immediately preceding the year for which such reduction is made neither a voluntary diversion program nor a voluntary certificate program was in effect and there was noncompliance with the farm acreage allotment for such year; (ii) for purposes of clause (i), any farm on which the entire amount of farm marketing excess is delivered to the Secretary, stored, or adjusted to zero in accordance with applicable regulations to avoid or postpone payment of the penalty when farm marketing quotas are in effect, shall be considered in compliance with the allotment, but if any part of the amount of wheat so stored is later depleted and penalty becomes due by reason of such depletion, the allotment for such farm next computed after determination of such depletion shall be reduced by reducing the allotment for the immediately preceding year by 7 per centum; and (iii) for purposes of clause (i) if the Secretary determines that the reduction in the allotment does not provide fair and equitable treatment to producers on farms following special crop rotation practices, he may modify such reduction in the allotment as he determines to be necessary to provide fair and equitable treatment to such producers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repealed. Pub. L. 89&ndash;321, title V, &sect;501(6), Nov. 3, 1965, 79 Stat. 1201</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Increase in acreage allotments and marketing quotas for class II durum wheat</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, with respect to the 1962 and 1963 crops of wheat, the Secretary determines that the acreage allotments of farms producing durum wheat are inadequate to provide for the production of a sufficient quantity of durum wheat to satisfy the demands therefor (but not including export demand involving a subsidy by, or a loss to, the Federal Government), he shall increase the farm marketing quotas and acreage allotments for such crop of wheat for farms located in counties in the States of North Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, South Dakota, and California, designated by the Secretary as counties which (1) are capable of producing durum wheat (class II), and (2) have produced such wheat for commercial food products during one or more of the five years immediately preceding the year in which such crop is harvested. The Secretary shall determine the percentage factor by which the average acreage of durum wheat (class II) produced during the last two-year period for which statistics are available (excluding any increases in durum wheat acreage as a result of increases in wheat acreage allotments authorized by this subsection) must be increased to satisfy such demand. The wheat acreage allotment for any farm established for such crop without regard to this subsection, after reduction in the case of the 1962 crop as required by subsection (c)(2) of this section (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;original allotment&rdquo;), shall be increased by an acreage computed by multiplying the average acreage of durum wheat (class II) on the farm during such two-year period (excluding any increase in the acreage of durum wheat as a result <!-- PDFPage:542 -->of an increase in the wheat acreage allotment for the farm authorized by this subsection) by such percentage factor: <em>Provided</em>, That such increased allotment shall not exceed the cropland on the farm well suited to wheat. The increase in the wheat acreage allotment for any farm shall be conditioned upon the production of an acreage of durum wheat (class II) at least equal to the average acreage of such wheat produced during such two-year period plus the number of acres by which the allotment is increased. Any increases in wheat acreage allotments authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to the National, State, and county wheat acreage allotments, and such increases shall not be considered in establishing future State, county, and farm allotments. The provisions of sections 1326(b) and 1340(6) of this title, relating to the reduction of the storage amount of wheat shall apply to the allotment for the farm established without regard to this subsection and not to the increased allotment under this subsection. As used in this subsection the term &ldquo;durum wheat&rdquo; means durum wheat (class II) other than the varieties known as &ldquo;Golden Ball&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peliss&rdquo;. Any farm receiving an increased allotment under this subsection shall not be required as a condition of eligibility for price support, or permitted, to participate in the special 1962 wheat program formulated under section 124 of the Agricultural Act of 1961, or section 307 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962. The Secretary shall give growers and millers of durum wheat and manufacturers of semolina products an opportunity to present their views and recommendations, prior to making any determination hereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Voluntary surrender of acreage allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any part of any 1955, 1956, or 1957 farm wheat acreage allotment on which wheat will not be planted and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the allotment to such farm and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving allotments in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable on the basis of past acreage of wheat tillable acres, crop rotation practices, type of soil, and topography. If all of the allotted acreage voluntarily surrendered is not needed in the county, the county committee may surrender the excess acreage to the State committee to be used for the same purposes as the State acreage reserve under subsection (c) of this section. Any allotment transferred under this provision shall be regarded for the purposes of subsection (c) of this section as having been planted on the farm from which transferred rather than on the farm to which transferred, except that this shall not operate to make the farm from which the allotment was transferred eligible for an allotment as having wheat planted thereon during the three-year base period: <em>Provided</em>, That notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any part of any 1955, 1956, or 1957 farm acreage allotment may be permanently released in writing to the county committee by the owner and operator of the farm, and reapportioned as provided herein. Acreage surrendered, reapportioned under this subsection, and planted shall be credited to the State and county in determining future acreage allotments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Plantings in excess of allotments or where no allotment is established</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no acreage in the commercial wheat-producing area seeded to wheat for harvest as grain in 1958 or thereafter except 1965 in excess of acreage allotments shall be considered in establishing future State and county acreage allotments. The planting on a farm in the commercial wheat-producing area of wheat of the 1958 or any subsequent crop for which no farm wheat acreage allotment was established shall not make the farm eligible for an allotment as an old farm pursuant to the first sentence of subsection (c) of this section nor shall such farm by reason of such planting be considered ineligible for an allotment as a new farm under the second sentence of such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Increase in acreage allotments for any kind of wheat in short supply; storage reduction and land-use provisions inapplicable to such wheat</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, with respect to any crop of wheat, the Secretary finds that the acreage allotments of farms producing any type of wheat are inadequate to provide for the production of a sufficient quantity of such type of wheat to satisfy the demand therefor, the wheat acreage allotment for such crop for each farm located in a county designated by the Secretary as a county which (1) is capable of producing such type of wheat, and (2) has produced such type of wheat for commercial food products during one or more of the five years immediately preceding the year in which such crop is harvested, shall be increased by such uniform percentage as he deems necessary to provide for such quantity. No increase shall be made under this subsection in the wheat acreage allotment of any farm for any crop if any wheat other than such type of wheat is planted on such farm for such crop. Any increases in wheat acreage allotments authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to the National, State, and county wheat acreage allotments, and such increases shall not be considered in establishing future State, county, and farm allotments. The provisions of sections 1326(b) and 1340(6) of this title, relating to the reduction of the storage amount of wheat shall apply to the allotment for the farm established without regard to this subsection and not to the increased allotment under this subsection. The land-use provisions of section 1339 of this title shall not be applicable to any farm receiving an increased allotment under this subsection and the producers on such farms shall not be required to comply with such provisions as a condition of eligibility for price support.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Increased durum wheat acreage allotments to Tulelake area, California, for 1970 and subsequent years; factors determinative; effect of increased allotments on marketing allocations and diversion payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall increase the acre<!-- PDFPage:543 -->age allotments for the 1970 and subsequent crops of wheat for privately owned farms in the irrigable portion of the area known as the Tulelake division of the Klamath project of California located in Modoc and Siskiyou Counties, California, as defined by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, and hereinafter referred to as the area. The increase for the area for each such crop shall be determined by adding, to the extent applications are made therefor, to the total allotments established for privately owned farms in the area for the particular crop without regard to this subsection (hereinafter referred to as the original allotments) an acreage sufficient to make available for each such crop a total allotment of twelve thousand acres for the area. The additional allotments made available by this subsection shall be in addition to the National, State, and county allotments otherwise established under this section, and the acreage planted to wheat pursuant to such increases in allotments shall not be taken into account in establishing future State, county, and farm acreage allotments except as may be desirable in providing increases in allotments for subsequent years under this subsection for the production of Durum&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1334_1_target" name="1334_1">1</a></sup> wheat. The Secretary shall apportion the additional allotment acreage made available under this subsection between Modoc and Siskiyou Counties on the basis of the relative needs for additional allotments for the portion of the area in each county. The Secretary shall allot such additional acreage to individual farms in the area for which applications for increased acreages are made on the basis of tillable acres, crop rotation practices, type of soil and topography, and the original allotment for the farm, if any. The increase in the wheat acreage allotment for any farm under this subsection (1) shall not be taken into account in computing the farm wheat marketing allocation under section 1379b of this title, and (2) shall be conditioned upon the production of Durum&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1334_1_target" name="1334_1">1</a></sup> wheat on the original allotment and on the increased acreage. The producers on a farm receiving an increased allotment under this subsection shall not be eligible for diversion payments under section 1339 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Transfer of farm wheat acreage allotments in case of natural disasters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the Secretary determines that because of a natural disaster a portion of the farm wheat acreage allotments in a county cannot be timely planted or replanted, he may authorize the transfer of all or a part of the wheat acreage allotment for any farm in the county so affected to another farm in the county or in an adjoining county on which one or more of the producers on the farm from which the transfer is to be made will be engaged in the production of wheat and will share in the proceeds thereof, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. Any farm allotment transferred under this subsection shall be deemed to be planted on the farm from which it was transferred for the purposes of acreage history credits under this chapter.</p>

L. 87&ndash;128, &sect;125, authorized the Secretary to increase durum wheat acreage allotment during 1962, 1963, and 1964 crops of wheat when he determines that acreage allotments established for durum wheat farms will be inadequate to produce a sufficient quantity of durum wheat to meet demand therefor, not including export demand involving a subsidy by or loss to the Federal Government, by such percentage factor as is determined to be necessary to provide for the increase in quantity the increase not to exceed the cropland on the farm well suited to wheat and to be conditioned upon the production of an acreage of durum wheat (class II) at least equal to the average acreage of such wheat produced during prescribed two-year period plus the number of acres by which the allotment is increased, provided that any farm receiving an increased durum wheat allotment shall not be required as a condition of price support, or permitted, to participate in the special 1962 wheat diversion program, and required the Secretary to become familiar with the views and recommendations of durum wheat grower and millers and manufacturers of semolina products prior to making any determinations. Former provisions of the subsection related to increase in allotment for durum wheat farms for 1957 crop of wheat, conditioned upon the production of durum wheat (class II) on the increased acreage and determined by adding to the allotment established without regard to subsec.

The acreage allotment for any farm shall be the larger of (1) the small-farm base acreage determined as provided above on the basis of the three-year period 1959&ndash;1961, reduced by the same percentage by which the national acreage allotment for the crop is reduced below fifty-five million acres, or (2) the acreage allotment determined without regard to (1) above. If the operator of any such farm fails to make such election with respect to any crop of wheat, (i) for the purposes of section 1340 of this title, the farm acreage allotment for such crop of wheat shall be deemed to be the larger of (A) the small-farm base acreage or (B) the acreage allotment for the farm, (ii) the land-use provisions of section 1339 of this title shall be inapplicable to the farm, (iii) such crop of wheat shall not be eligible for price support, and (iv) wheat marketing certificates applicable to such crop shall not be issued with respect to the farm. The additional acreage required to provide acreage allotments for farms based upon small-farm base acreages under this section shall be in addition to National, State, and county acreage allotments. This section shall not be applicable to the crops planted for harvest in 1967 and subsequent years.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Penalties: computation, lien, joint and several liability and interest; exceptions: nonsurplus supply crops, substantial impairment, and nonproduction of wheat; diverted acreage: amount, annual identity, and grazing; crops available for marketing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During any year in which marketing quotas for wheat are in effect, the producers on any farm (except a new farm receiving an allotment from the reserve for new farms) on which any crop is produced on acreage required to be diverted from the production of wheat shall be subject to a penalty on such crop, in addition to any marketing quota penalty applicable to such crops, as provided in this subsection unless (1) the crop is designated by the Secretary as one which is not in surplus supply and will not be in surplus supply if it is permitted to be grown on the diverted acreage, or as one the production of which will not substantially impair the purpose of the requirements of this section, or (2) no wheat is produced on the farm, and the producers have not filed an agreement or a statement of intention to participate in the payment program formulated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The acreage required to be diverted from the production of wheat on the farm shall be an acreage of cropland equal to the number of acres determined by multiplying the farm acreage allotment by the diversion factor determined by dividing the number of acres by which the national acreage allotment (less an acreage equal to the increased acreage allotted for 1966 pursuant to section 1335 of this title) is reduced below fifty-five million acres by the number of acres in the national acreage allotment (less an acreage equal to the increased acreage allotted for 1966 pursuant to section 1335 of this title). The actual production of any crop subject to penalty under this subsection shall be regarded as available for marketing and the penalty on such crop shall be computed on the actual acreage of such crop at the rate of 65 per centum of the parity price per bushel of wheat as of May 1 of the calendar year in which such crop is harvested, multiplied by the normal yield of wheat per acre established for the farm. Until the producers on any farm pay the penalty on such crop, the entire crop of wheat produced on the farm and any subsequent crop of wheat subject to marketing quotas in which the producer has an interest shall be subject to a lien in favor of the United States for the amount of the penalty. Each producer having an interest in the crop or crops on acreage diverted or required to be diverted from the production of wheat shall be <!-- PDFPage:551 -->jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the penalty. The persons liable for the payment or collection of the penalty under this section shall be liable also for interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date the penalty becomes due until the date of payment of such penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may require that the acreage on any farm diverted from the production of wheat be land which was diverted from the production of wheat in the previous year, to the extent he determines that such requirement is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may permit the diverted acreage to be grazed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment program for 1964 through 1970 crops; terms and conditions; amount; additional diverted acreage; conservation and soil-conserving uses; adjustment; knowledge of exceeding acreage allotment; acreage allotment not exceeded by delivery to Secretary of farm marketing excess or storage in accordance with regulations to avoid or postpone payment of penalty or by farms exempt from marketing quota; new farms ineligible for payments; sharing and medium of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to formulate and carry out a program with respect to the crops of wheat planted for harvest in the calendar years 1964 through 1970 under which, subject to such terms and conditions as he determines are desirable to effectuate the purposes of this section, payments may be made in amounts not in excess of 50 per centum of the estimated basic county support rate for wheat not accompanied by marketing certificates on the normal production of the acreage diverted taking into account the income objectives of the chapter, determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable with respect to acreage diverted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Any producer who complies with his 1964 farm acreage allotment for wheat and with the other requirements of the program shall be eligible to receive payments under the program for the 1964 crop of wheat. The Secretary may permit producers on any farm to divert from the production of wheat an acreage, in addition to the acreage diverted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, equal to 50 per centum of the farm acreage allotment for wheat: <em>Provided</em>, That the producers on any farm may, at their election, divert such acreage in addition to the acreage diverted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, as will bring the total acreage diverted on the farm to twenty-five acres. Such program shall require (1) that the diverted acreage shall be devoted to conservation uses approved by the Secretary; (2) that the total acreage of cropland on the farm devoted to soil-conserving uses, including summer fallow and idle land but excluding the acreage diverted as provided above, shall be not less than the total average acreage of cropland devoted to soil-conserving uses including summer fallow and idle land on the farm during a representative period, as determined by the Secretary, adjusted to the extent the Secretary determines appropriate for (i) abnormal weather conditions or other factors affecting production, (ii) established crop-rotation practices on the farm, (iii) participation in other Federal farm programs, (iv) unusually high percentage of land on the farm devoted to conserving uses, and (v) other factors which the Secretary determines should be considered for the purpose of establishing a fair and equitable soil-conserving acreage for the farm; and (3) that the producer shall not knowingly exceed (i) any farm acreage allotment in effect for any commodity produced on the farm, and (ii) except as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, with the farm acreage allotments on any other farm for any crop in which the producer has a share: <em>Provided</em>, That no producer shall be deemed to have exceeded a farm acreage allotment for wheat if the entire amount of the farm marketing excess is delivered to the Secretary or stored in accordance with applicable regulations to avoid or postpone payment of the penalty: <em>And provided further</em>, That no producer shall be deemed to have exceeded a farm acreage allotment for any crop of wheat if the farm is exempt from the farm marketing quota for such crop under section 1335 of this title. The producers on a new farm shall not be eligible for payments hereunder. The Secretary shall provide for the sharing of payment among producers on the farm on a fair and equitable basis. Payments may be made in cash or in wheat.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustment of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may provide for adjusting any payment on account of failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the land-use program formulated under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Advance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not to exceed 50 per centum of any payment to producers under subsection (b) of this section may be made in advance of determination of performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Diverted acreage used for production of certain crops; rate of payment; limitation on rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may permit all or any part of the diverted acreage to be devoted to the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, and flaxseed, if he determines that such production of the commodity is needed to provide an adequate supply, is not likely to increase the cost of the price-support program and will not adversely affect farm income, subject to the condition that payment with respect to diverted acreage devoted to any such crop shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable taking into consideration the use of such acreage for the production of such crops: <em>Provided</em>, That in no event shall the payment exceed one-half the rate which otherwise would be applicable if such acreage were devoted to conservation uses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program formulated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may include such terms and conditions, including provision for the control of erosion, in addition to those specifically provided for herein, as the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:552 -->determines are desirable to effectuate the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to promulgate such regulations as may be desirable to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Commodity Credit Corporation funds and authorization of appropriations for payments and administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to utilize its capital funds and other assets for the purpose of making the payments authorized in this section and to pay administrative expenses necessary in carrying out this section during the period ending June 30, 1965. There is authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary thereafter to pay such administrative expenses.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall permit any producer who is participating in the wheat program under title IV of this Act, in the feed grain program under title V of this Act, or in the cotton program under title VI of this Act, in any year in which an acreage diversion or set-aside program is in effect, under any such program in which such producer is participating, subject to the conditions prescribed in subsection (b) of this section, to plant and harvest hay from 25 per centum of the acreage on the farm diverted from production under such programs or twenty-five acres, whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any producer who elects to plant and harvest hay on diverted or set aside acreage pursuant to this section shall first agree not to use any such hay harvested from such acreage unless authorized to do so by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When any diverted or set aside acreage has been planted and harvested under authority of this section, the hay harvested therefrom shall be baled and stored in sealed storage on the farm in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe and shall be available only for use during periods of emergency declared by the Secretary. In order to avoid deterioration of such hay stored on the farm for emergency purposes pursuant to this section, the Secretary may permit such hay to be removed and used or sold from time to time so long as an amount of hay equal to the amount removed is previously placed in storage and sealed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any farmer who has hay stored on his farm for emergency purposes pursuant to this section may remove such hay from storage and use it whenever the Secretary has (1) designated as an emergency area the area in which such farm is located, and (2) specifically authorized the use of emergency hay by farmers in the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to make or guarantee loans to farmers, both tenants and landowners, to assist such farmers in the construction of storage facilities on the farm for the storage of emergency hay pursuant to the provisions of this section if such farmers are unable to obtain loans from commercial sources at reasonable rates and on reasonable terms and conditions. Loans made by the Secretary under this subsection shall be made at the current rate of interest for periods not exceeding ten years, and on such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The farm marketing quota for any crop of wheat shall be the actual production of the acreage planted to such crop of wheat on the farm less the farm marketing excess. The farm marketing excess shall be an amount equal to twice the projected farm yield multiplied by the number of acres of such crop of wheat on the farm in excess of the farm acreage allotment for such crop unless the producer, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary and within the time prescribed therein, establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary the actual production of such crop of wheat on the farm. If such actual production is so established, the farm marketing excess shall be an amount equal to the actual production of the number of acres of wheat on the farm in excess of the farm acreage allotment for such crop. In determining the farm marketing quota and farm marketing excess, any acreage of wheat remaining after the date prescribed by the Secretary for the disposal of excess acres of wheat shall be included as acreage of wheat on the farm, and the production thereof shall be appraised in such manner as the Secretary determines will provide a reasonably accurate estimate of such production. Any acreage of wheat disposed of in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary prior to such date as may be prescribed by the Secretary shall be excluded in determining the farm marketing quota and farm marketing excess. Self-seeded (volunteer) wheat shall be included in determining the acreage of wheat. Marketing quotas for any marketing year shall be in effect with respect to wheat harvested in the calendar year in which such marketing year begins notwithstanding that the wheat is marketed prior to the beginning of such marketing year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Whenever farm marketing quotas are in effect with respect to any crop of wheat, the producers on a farm shall be subject to a penalty on the farm marketing excess of wheat at a rate per bushel equal to 65 per centum of the parity price per bushel of wheat as of May 1 of the calendar year in which the crop is harvested. Each producer having an interest in the crop of wheat on any farm for which a <!-- PDFPage:555 -->farm marketing excess of wheat is determined shall be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the penalty on the farm marketing excess.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The farm marketing excess for wheat shall be regarded as available for marketing, and the penalty and the storage amount or amounts to be delivered to the Secretary of the commodity shall be computed upon twice the normal production of the excess acreage. Where, upon the application of the producer for an adjustment of penalty or of storage, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the actual production of the excess acreage is less than twice the normal production thereof, the difference between the amount of the penalty or storage as computed upon the basis of twice the normal production and as computed upon the basis of actual production shall be returned to or allowed the producer. The Secretary shall issue regulations under which the farm marketing excess of the commodity for the farm may be stored or delivered to him. Upon failure to store or deliver to the Secretary the farm marketing excess within such time as may be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the penalty computed as aforesaid shall be paid by the producer. Any wheat delivered to the Secretary hereunder shall become the property of the United States and shall be disposed of by the Secretary for relief purposes in the United States or in foreign countries or in such other manner as he shall determine will divert it from the normal channels of trade and commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Until the producers on any farm store, deliver to the Secretary, or pay the penalty on, the farm marketing excess of any crop of wheat, the entire crop of wheat produced on the farm and any subsequent crop of wheat subject to marketing quotas in which the producer has an interest shall be subject to a lien in favor of the United States for the amount of the penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The penalty upon wheat stored shall be paid by the producer at the time, and to the extent, of any depletion in the amount of the commodity so stored, except depletion resulting from some cause beyond the control of the producer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Whenever the planted acreage of the then current crop of wheat on any farm is less than the farm acreage allotment for such commodity, the total amount of the commodity from any previous crops required to be stored in order to postpone or avoid payment of penalty shall be reduced by that amount which is equal to the normal production of the number of acres by which the farm acreage allotment exceeds the planted acreage. The provisions of section 1326(b) and (c) of this title shall be applicable also to wheat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Until the farm marketing excess of wheat is stored or delivered to the Secretary or the penalty thereon is paid, each bushel of the commodity produced on the farm which is sold by the producer to any person within the United States shall be subject to the penalty as specified in paragraph (2) of this section. Such penalty shall be paid by the buyer, who may deduct an amount equivalent to the penalty from the price paid to the producer. If the buyer fails to collect such penalty, such buyer and all persons entitled to share in the wheat marketed from the farm or the proceeds thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for such penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The marketing penalty for rice produced in the calendar year in which any marketing year begins (if beginning with or after the 1941&ndash;1942 marketing year) shall be at a rate equal to 50 per centum of the basic rate of the loan for cooperators for such marketing year under section 1302 of this title and this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Omitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The provisions of this section are amendatory of and supplementary to this chapter, and all provisions of law applicable in respect of marketing quotas and loans under such chapter as so amended and supplemented shall be applicable, but nothing in this section shall be construed to amend or repeal sections 1301(b)(6), 1323(b), or 1335(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The persons liable for the payment or collection of the penalty or any amount of wheat shall be liable also for interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date the penalty becomes due until the date of payment of such penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) If marketing quotas for wheat are not in effect for any marketing year, all previous marketing quotas applicable to wheat shall be terminated, effective as of the first day of such marketing year. Such termination shall not abate any penalty previously incurred by a producer or relieve any buyer of the duty to remit penalties previously collected by him.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">American cotton is a basic source of clothing and industrial products used by every person in the United States and by substantial numbers of people in foreign countries. American cotton is sold on a world-wide market and moves from the places of production almost entirely in interstate and foreign commerce to processing establishments located throughout the world at places outside the State where the cotton is produced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Fluctuations in supplies of cotton and the marketing of excessive supplies of cotton in interstate and foreign commerce disrupt the orderly marketing of cotton in such commerce with consequent injury to and destruction of such commerce. Excessive supplies of cotton directly and materially affect the volume of cotton moving in interstate and foreign commerce and cause disparity in prices of cotton and industrial products moving in interstate and foreign commerce with consequent diminution of the volume of such commerce in industrial products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The conditions affecting the production and marketing of cotton are such that, without Federal assistance, farmers, individually or in cooperation, cannot effectively prevent the recurrence of excessive supplies of cotton and fluctuations in supplies, cannot prevent indiscriminate dumping of excessive supplies on the Nation-wide and foreign markets, cannot maintain normal carry-overs of cotton, and cannot provide for the orderly marketing of cotton in interstate and foreign commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It is in the interest of the general welfare that interstate and foreign commerce in cotton be protected from the burdens caused by the marketing of excessive supplies of cotton in such commerce, that a supply of cotton be maintained which is adequate to meet domestic consumption and export requirements in years of drought, flood, and other adverse conditions as well as in years of plenty, and that the soil resources of the Nation be not wasted in the production of excessive supplies of cotton.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this subpart affording a cooperative plan to cotton producers are necessary and appropriate to prevent the burdens on interstate and foreign commerce caused by the marketing in such commerce of excessive supplies, and to promote, foster, and maintain an orderly flow of an adequate supply of cotton in such commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever during any calendar year the Secretary determines that the total supply of cotton for the marketing year beginning in such calendar year will exceed the normal supply for such marketing year, the Secretary shall proclaim such fact and a national marketing quota shall be in effect for the crop of cotton produced in the next calendar year. The Secretary shall also determine and specify in such proclamation the amount of the national marketing quota in terms of the number of bales of cotton (standard bales of five hundred pounds gross weight) adequate, together with (1) the estimated carry-over at the beginning of the marketing year which begins in the next calendar year and (2) the estimated imports during such marketing year, to make available a normal supply of cotton: <em>Provided</em>, That beginning with the 1961 crop, the national marketing quota shall be not less than a number of bales equal to the estimated domestic consumption and estimated exports (less estimated imports) for the marketing year for which the quota is proclaimed, except that the Secretary shall make such adjustment in the amount of such quota as he determines necessary after taking into consideration the estimated stocks of cotton in the United States (including the qualities of such stocks) and stocks in foreign countries which would be available for the marketing year for which the quota is being proclaimed if no adjustment of such quota is made hereunder, to assure the maintenance of adequate but not excessive stocks in the United States to provide a continuous and stable supply of the different qualities of cotton needed in the United States and in foreign cotton consuming countries, and for purposes of national security; but the Secretary, in making such adjustments, may not reduce the national marketing quota for any year below (i) one million bales less than the estimated domestic consumption and estimated exports for the marketing year for which such quota is being proclaimed, or (ii) ten million bales, whichever is larger. Such proclamation shall be made not later than October 15 of the calendar year in which such determination is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the national marketing quota for cotton for 1957 and 1958 shall be not less than the number of bales required to pro<!-- PDFPage:558 -->vide a national acreage allotment for 1957 and 1958 equal to the national acreage allotment for 1956: <em>Provided</em>, That if the acreage allotment for any State for 1957 or 1958 is less than its allotment for the preceding year by more than 1 per centum, such State allotment shall be increased so that the reduction shall not exceed 1 per centum per annum, and the acreage required for such increase shall be in addition to the national acreage allotment for such year. Additional acreage apportioned to a State for 1957 or 1958 under the foregoing proviso shall not be taken into account in establishing future State allotments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the national marketing quota for upland cotton for 1959 and subsequent years shall be not less than the number of bales required to provide a national acreage allotment for each such year of sixteen million acres.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1344. Apportionment of national acreage allotments</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a national marketing quota is proclaimed under section 1342 of this title, the Secretary shall determine and proclaim a national acreage allotment for the crop of cotton to be <!-- PDFPage:560 -->produced in the next calendar year. The national acreage allotment for cotton shall be that acreage, based upon the national average yield per acre of cotton for the four years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the national marketing quota is proclaimed, required to make available from such crop an amount of cotton equal to the national marketing quota.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Apportionment among States for year 1953 and subsequent years; adjustment; national acreage reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national acreage allotment for cotton for 1953 and subsequent years shall be apportioned to the States on the basis of the acreage planted to cotton (including the acreage regarded as having been planted to cotton under the provisions of Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) during the five calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the national marketing quota is proclaimed, with adjustments for abnormal weather conditions during such period: <em>Provided</em>, That there is established a national acreage reserve consisting of three hundred and ten thousand acres which shall be in addition to the national acreage allotment; and such reserve shall be apportioned to the States on the basis of their needs for additional acreage for establishing minimum farm allotments under subsection (f)(1) of this section, as determined by the Secretary without regard to State and county acreage reserves (except that the amount apportioned to Nevada shall be one thousand acres). For the 1960 and succeeding crops of cotton, the needs of States (other than Nevada) for such additional acreage for such purpose may be estimated by the Secretary, after taking into consideration such needs as determined or estimated for the preceding crop of cotton and the size of the national acreage allotment for such crop. The additional acreage so apportioned to the State shall be apportioned to the counties on the basis of the needs of the counties for such additional acreage for such purpose, and added to the county acreage allotment for apportionment to farms pursuant to subsection (f) of this section (except that no part of such additional acreage shall be used to increase the county reserve above 15 per centum of the county allotment determined without regard to such additional acreage). Additional acreage apportioned to a State for any year under the foregoing proviso shall not be taken into account in establishing future State acreage allotments. Needs for additional acreage under the foregoing provisions and under the last proviso in subsection (e) of this section shall be determined or estimated as though allotments were first computed without regard to subsection (f)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Apportionment among States for years 1950 and 1951; computation and adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national acreage allotments for cotton for the years 1950 and 1951 shall be apportioned to the States on the basis of a national acreage allotment base of twenty-two million five hundred thousand acres, computed and adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The average of the planted acreages (including acreage regarded as planted under the provisions of Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) in the States for the years 1945, 1946, 1947, and 1948 shall constitute the national base; except that in the case of any State having a 1948 planted cotton acreage of over one million acres and less than 50 per centum of the 1943 allotment, the average of the acreage planted (or regarded as planted under Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) for the years 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, and 1948 shall constitute the base for such State and shall be included in computing the national base; to this is to be added (A) the estimated additional acreage for each State required for small-farm allotments under subsection (f)(1) of this section; (B) the acreage required as a result of the State adjustment provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection; (C) the additional acreage required to determine a total national allotment base of twenty-two million five hundred thousand acres, which additional acreage shall be distributed on a proportionate basis among States receiving no adjustment under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the acreage allotment base for 1950 and 1951 for any State (on the basis of a national acreage allotment base of twenty-two million five hundred thousand acres) shall not be less than the larger of (1) 95 per centum of the average acreage actually planted to cotton in the State during the years 1947 and 1948, or (2) 85 per centum of the acreage planted to cotton in the State in 1948.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If the national acreage allotment for 1950 or 1951 is more or less than twenty-two million five hundred thousand acres, horizontal adjustments shall be made percentagewise by States so as to reflect the ratio of the national acreage allotment for 1950 and 1951 to twenty-two million five hundred thousand acres.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Apportionment for year 1952; adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national acreage allotment for cotton for 1952 shall be apportioned to States on the basis of the acreage planted to cotton (including the acreage regarded as having been planted to cotton under the provisions of Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) during the years 1946, 1947, 1948, and 1950, with adjustments for abnormal weather conditions during such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Apportionment among counties; reservation of acreage; additional acreage for establishing minimum farm allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State acreage allotment for cotton shall be apportioned to counties on the same basis as to years and conditions as is applicable to the State under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the State committee may reserve not to exceed 10 per centum of its State acreage allotment (15 per centum if the State's 1948 planted acreage was in excess of one million acres and less than half its 1943 allotment) which shall be used to make adjustments in county allotments for trends in acreage, for counties adversely affected by abnormal conditions affecting plantings, or for small or new farms, or to correct inequities in farm allotments and to prevent hardship: <em>Provided further</em>, That if the additional acreage allocated to a State under the proviso in subsection (b) of this <!-- PDFPage:561 -->section is less than the requirements as determined or estimated by the Secretary for establishing minimum farm allotments for the State under subsection (f)(1) of this section, the acreage reserved under this subsection shall not be less than the smaller of (1) the remaining acreage so determined or estimated to be required for establishing minimum farm allotments or (2) 3 per centum of the State acreage allotment; and the acreage which is required to be reserved under this proviso shall be allocated to counties on the basis of their needs for additional acreage for establishing minimum farm allotments under subsection (f)(1) of this section, and added to the county acreage allotment for apportionment to farms pursuant to subsection (f) of this section (except that no part of such additional acreage shall be used to increase the county reserve above 15 per centum of the county allotment determined without regard to such additional acreages).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Apportionment among farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The county acreage allotment, less not to exceed the percentage provided for in paragraph 3 of this subsection, shall be apportioned to farms on which cotton has been planted (or regarded as having been planted under the provisions of Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) in any one of the three years immediately preceding the year for which such allotment is determined on the following basis:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Insofar as such acreage is available, there shall be allotted the smaller of the following: (A) ten acres; or (B) the acreage allotment established for the farm for the 1958 crop.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The remainder shall be allotted to farms other than farms to which an allotment has been made under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection so that the allotment to each farm under this paragraph together with the amount of the allotment to such farm under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection shall be a prescribed percentage (which percentage shall be the same for all such farms in the county or administrative area) of the acreage, during the preceding year, on the farm which is tilled annually or in regular rotation, excluding from such acreages the acres devoted to the production of sugarcane for sugar; sugar beets for sugar; wheat, tobacco, or rice for market; peanuts picked and threshed; wheat or rice for feeding to livestock for market; or lands determined to be devoted primarily to orchards or vineyards, and nonirrigated lands in irrigated areas: <em>Provided, however</em>, That if a farm would be allotted under this paragraph an acreage together with the amount of the allotment to such farm under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection in excess of the largest acreage planted (and regarded as planted under Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) to cotton during any of the preceding three years, the acreage allotment for such farm shall not exceed such largest acreage so planted (and regarded as planted under Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) in any such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The county committee may reserve not in excess of 15 per centum of the county allotment (15 per centum if the State's 1948 planted cotton acreage was in excess of one million acres and less than half its 1943 allotment) which, in addition to the acreage made available under the proviso in subsection (e) of this section, shall be used for (A) establishing allotments for farms on which cotton was not planted (or regarded as planted under Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) during any of the three calendar years immediately preceding the year for which the allotment is made, on the basis of land, labor, and equipment available for the production of cotton, crop-rotation practices, and the soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of cotton; and (B) making adjustments of the farm acreage allotments established under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection so as to establish allotments which are fair and reasonable in relation to the factors set forth in this paragraph and abnormal conditions of production on such farms, or in making adjustments in farm acreage allotments to correct inequities and to prevent hardship: <em>Provided</em>, That not less than 20 per centum of the acreage reserved under this subsection shall, to the extent required, be allotted, upon such basis as the Secretary deems fair and reasonable to farms (other than farms to which an allotment has been made under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection), if any, to which an allotment of not exceeding fifteen acres may be made under other provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any part of the acreage allotted for 1950 to individual farms in any county under the provisions of this section which will not be planted to cotton and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the allotments to such farms and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving allotments to the extent necessary to provide such farms with the allotments authorized under paragraph (5) of this subsection. If any acreage remains after providing such allotments, it may be apportioned in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable to other farms in the same county receiving allotments which the county committee determines are inadequate and not representative in view of their past production of cotton and to new farms in such county. No allotment shall be made, or increased, by reason of this paragraph to an acreage in excess of 40 per centum of the acreage on the farm which is tilled annually or in regular rotation, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Any transfer of allotment under this paragraph shall not operate to reduce the allotment for any subsequent year for the farm from which acreage is transferred, except in accordance with paragraph (1)(B) and the proviso in paragraph (2) of this subsection: <em>Provided</em>, That any part of any farm acreage allotment may be permanently released in writing to the county committee by the owner and operator of the farm and may be reapportioned in the manner set forth above. In any subsequent year, unless hereafter otherwise provided by law, acreage surrendered under this paragraph and reallocated pursuant to applications filed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this section shall be <!-- PDFPage:562 -->credited to the State and county in determining acreage allotments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and without reducing any farm acreage allotment determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, each farm acreage allotment for 1950 shall be increased by such amount as may be necessary to provide an allotment equal to the larger of 65 per centum of the average acreage planted to cotton (or regarded as planted to cotton under the provisions of Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) on the farm in 1946, 1947, and 1948, or 45 per centum of the highest acreage planted to cotton (or regarded as planted to cotton under Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress) on the farm in any one of such three years; but no such allotment shall be increased by reason of this provision to an acreage in excess of 40 per centum of the acreage on the farm which is tilled annually or in regular rotation, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. An increase in any 1950 farm acreage allotment shall be made pursuant to this paragraph only upon application in writing by the owner or operator of the farm within such reasonable period of time (in no event less than fifteen days) as may be prescribed by the Secretary. The additional acreage required to be allotted to farms under this paragraph shall be in addition to the county, State, and national acreage allotments and the production from such acreage shall be in addition to the national marketing quota. The additional acreage authorized by this paragraph shall not be taken into account in establishing future State, county, and farm acreage allotments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of the subsection, if the county committee recommends such action and the Secretary determines that such action will result in a more equitable distribution of the county allotment among farms in the county, the remainder of the county acreage allotment (after making allotments as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection) shall be allotted to farms other than farms to which an allotment has been made under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection so that the allotment to each farm under this paragraph together with the amount of the allotment of such farm under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection shall be a prescribed percentage (which percentage shall be the same for all such farms in the county) of the average acreage planted to cotton on the farm during the three years immediately preceding the year for which such allotment is determined, adjusted as may be necessary for abnormal conditions affecting plantings during such three-year period: <em>Provided</em>, That the county committee may in its discretion limit any farm acreage allotment established under the provisions of this paragraph for any year to an acreage not in excess of 50 per centum of the cropland on the farm, as determined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection: <em>Provided further</em>, That any part of the county acreage allotment not apportioned under this paragraph by reason of the initial application of such 50 per centum limitation shall be added to the county acreage reserve under paragraph (3) of this subsection and shall be available for the purposes specified therein. If the county acreage allotment is apportioned among the farms of the county in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the acreage reserved under paragraph (3) of this subsection may be used to make adjustments so as to establish allotments which are fair and reasonable to farms receiving allotments under this paragraph in relation to the factors set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7)(A) In the event that any farm acreage allotment is less than that prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subsection, such acreage allotment shall be increased to the acreage prescribed by said paragraph (1). The additional acreage required to be allotted to farms under this paragraph shall be in addition to the county, State, and national acreage allotments and the production from such acreage shall be in addition to the national marketing quota.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the acreage by which any farm acreage allotment for 1959 or any subsequent crop established under paragraph (1) of this subsection exceeds the acreage which would have been allotted to such farm if its allotment had been computed on the basis of the same percentage factor applied to other farms in the county under paragraph (2), (6), or (8) of this subsection shall not be taken into account in establishing the acreage allotment for such farm for any crop for which acreage is allotted to such farm under paragraph (2), (6), or (8) of this subsection; and acreage shall be allotted under paragraph (2), (6), or (8) of this subsection to farms which did not receive 1958 crop allotments in excess of ten acres if and only if the Secretary determines (after considering the allotments to other farms in the county for such crop compared with their 1958 allotments and other relevant factors) that equity and justice require the allotment of additional acreage to such farm under paragraph (2), (6), or (8) of this subsection,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the acreage by which any county acreage allotment for 1959 or any subsequent crop is increased from the national or State reserve on the basis of its needs for additional acreage for establishing minimum farm allotments shall not be taken into account in establishing future county acreage allotments, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the additional acreage allotted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (7) shall not be taken into account in establishing future State, county, or farm acreage allotments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of paragraphs (2) and (6) of this subsection, the Secretary shall, if allotments were in effect the preceding year, provide for the county acreage allotment for the 1959 and succeeding crops of cotton, less the acreage reserved under paragraph (3) of this subsection, to be apportioned to farms on which cotton has been planted in any one of the three years imme<!-- PDFPage:563 -->diately preceding the year for which such allotment is determined, on the basis of the farm acreage allotment for the year immediately preceding the year for which such apportionment is made, adjusted as may be necessary (i) for any change in the acreage of cropland available for the production of cotton, or (ii) to meet the requirements of any provision (other than those contained in paragraphs (2) and (6)) with respect to the counting of acreage for history purposes: <em>Provided</em>, That, beginning with allotments established for the 1961 crop of cotton, if the acreage actually planted (or regarded as planted under the Soil Bank Act, the environmental quality incentives program established under chapter 4 of subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 [16 U.S.C. 3839aa et seq.], and the release and reapportionment provisions of subsection (m) (2) of this section) to cotton on the farm in the preceding year was less than 75 per centum of the farm allotment for such year or, in the case of a farm which qualified for price support on the crop produced in such year under section 1444(b) of this title, 75 per centum of the farm domestic allotment established under section 1350 of this title for such year, whichever is smaller, in lieu of using such allotment as the farm base as provided in this paragraph, the base shall be the average of (1) the cotton acreage for the farm for the preceding year as determined for purposes of this proviso and (2) the allotment established for the farm pursuant to the provisions of this subsection for such preceding year; and the 1958 allotment used for establishing the minimum farm allotment under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be adjusted to the average acreage so determined. The base for a farm shall not be adjusted as provided in this paragraph if the county committee determines that failure to plant at least 75 per centum of the farm allotment was due to conditions beyond the control of producers on the farm. The Secretary shall establish limitations to prevent allocations of allotment to farms not affected by the foregoing proviso, which would be excessive on the basis of the cropland, past cotton acreage, allotments for other commodities, and good soil conservation practices on such farms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Law and conditions governing establishment of acreage allotments and yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) State, county, and farm acreage allotments and yields for cotton shall be established in conformity with section 1344a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In apportioning the county allotment among the farms within the county, the Secretary, through the local committees, shall take into consideration different conditions within separate administrative areas within a county if any exist, including types, kinds, and productivity of the soil so as to prevent discrimination among the administrative areas of the county.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Repealed. Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title III, &sect;378(d), as added Aug. 28, 1958, Pub. L. 85&ndash;835, title V, &sect;501, 72 Stat. 996</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Excess planting; old and new farm allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any acreage planted to cotton in excess of the farm acreage allotment shall not be taken into account in establishing State, county, and farm acreage allotments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, beginning with the 1960 crop the planting of cotton on a farm in any of the immediately preceding three years that allotments were in effect but no allotment was established for such farm for any year of such three-year period shall not make the farm eligible for an allotment as an old farm under subsection (f) of this section: <em>Provided, however</em>, That by reason of such planting the farm need not be considered as ineligible for a new farm allotment under subsection (f)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Availability of records for inspection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, State and county committees shall make available for inspection by owners or operators of farms receiving cotton acreage allotments all records pertaining to cotton acreage allotments and marketing quotas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Minimum allotments to States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section except subsection (g)(1) of this section, there shall be allotted to each State for which an allotment is made under this section not less than the smaller of (A) four thousand acres or (B) the highest acreage planted to cotton in any one of the three calendar years immediately preceding the year for which the allotment is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Administration of law governing war crops</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary, in administering the provisions of Public Law 12, Seventy-ninth Congress, as it relates to war crops, shall carry out the provisions of such Act in the following manner:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) A survey shall be conducted of every farm which had a 1942 cotton acreage allotment, and of such other farms as the Secretary considers necessary in the administration of Public Law 12. This survey shall obtain for each farm the most accurate information possible on (a) the total acreage in cultivation, and (b) the acreage of individual crops planted on each farm in the years 1941, 1945, 1946, and 1947.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) An eligible farm for war-crop credit shall be a farm on which (a) the cotton acreage on the farm in 1945, 1946, or 1947, was reduced below the cotton acreage planted on the farm in 1941; (b) the war-crop acreage on the farm in 1945, 1946, or 1947, was increased above the war-crop acreage on the farm in 1941; and (c) the farm had a cotton acreage allotment in 1942.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) A farm shall be regarded as having planted cotton (in addition to the actual acreage planted to cotton) to the extent of the lesser of (a) the reduction in cotton acreage for each of the years 1945, 1946, and 1947, below the acreage planted to cotton in 1941, or (b) the increase in war crops for each of the years 1945, 1946, and 1947, above that planted to such war crops in 1941. However, the county com<!-- PDFPage:564 -->mittee may be given the discretion to adjust such war-crop credit when the county committee determines that the reduction in cotton acreage was not related to an increase in war crops, but the adjustment shall be made only after consultation with the producer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The Secretary, using the best information obtainable, and working with and through the State and county committees, shall use whatever means necessary to make an accurate determination of the credits due each individual farm, under Public Law 12.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The national acreage allotment established under subsection (a) of this section for the 1954 crop of cotton shall be increased to twenty-one million acres and apportioned to the States in the same manner in which the national acreage allotment heretofore established for 1954 was apportioned to the States. In addition to such increased national acreage allotment, and in order to provide equitable adjustments in 1954 farm acreage allotments, (A) three hundred and fifteen thousand additional acres shall be prorated as follows: one-half to the States of Arizona, California, and New Mexico, and one-half to the other States (excluding those which receive a minimum allotment under subsection (k) of this section), the proration of each half being made to the States participating therein on the basis of their respective shares of the increased national acreage allotment, and (B) such additional acreage shall be added as may be required to provide each State a total allotment under subsection (b) of this section and the provisions of this paragraph of not less than 66 per centum of the acreage planted to cotton in the State in 1952. The additional acreage made available to States under clause (B) of the preceding sentence shall not be taken into account in establishing future State acreage allotments. The additional acreage made available to States under the provisions of this paragraph shall be apportioned to counties on the basis of their respective shares of the State acreage allotment heretofore apportioned pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, and the additional acreage shall be apportioned to farms pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That, if the county committee determines that such action will result in a more equitable distribution of the additional county allotment among farms in the county, the additional acreage shall be apportioned by the county committee to farms so as to provide each farm with an allotment equal to the larger of 65 per centum of the average acreage planted to cotton on the farm in 1951, 1952, and 1953 (as determined by the county committee in establishing allotments under subsection (f) of this section) or 40 per centum of the highest acreage planted to cotton on the farm in any one of such three years as so determined: <em>Provided</em>, That the State committee in each State shall limit such increase based on the system of farming, soil, crop-rotation practices, and other physical factors affecting production in such State, to an acreage not in excess of 50 per centum of the cropland on the farm, as determined under regulations heretofore prescribed by the Secretary. If the additional acreage is insufficient to meet the total of the farm increases so computed, such farm increases shall be reduced pro rata to the additional acreage available to the county; if the additional acreage available to the county is in excess of the total of the farm increases so computed the acreage remaining after making such increases shall be allotted to farms pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f)(3) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, if the State committee determines that such action will result in a more equitable distribution of the additional acreage made available to the State under this paragraph it shall apportion such additional allotment directly to farms so as to provide each farm with an allotment equal to the larger of 65 per centum of the average acreage planted to cotton on the farm in 1951, 1952, and 1953 (as determined by the county committee in establishing allotments under subsection (f) of this section) or 40 per centum of the highest acreage planted to cotton on the farm in any one of such three years as so determined: <em>Provided</em>, That the State committee in each State shall limit such increase based on the system of farming, soil, crop-rotation practices, and other physical factors affecting production in such State, to an acreage not in excess of 50 per centum of the cropland on the farm, as determined under regulations heretofore prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That if the State total of the farm increases so computed exceeds the additional acreage made available to the State under this paragraph, such farm increases shall be reduced pro rata to the additional acreage available to the State. Any acreage unallotted to farms because of the limitations contained in the preceding sentence shall be apportioned by the State committee to counties on the basis of past acreages planted to cotton and shall be used by county committees for adjustments in farm allotments on the basis of one or more of the following: The past acreage of cotton on the farm, the percentage of cropland heretofore determined under subsection (f)(2) of this section, and the factors enumerated in subsection (f)(3) of this section. Before apportioning such unallotted acreage to counties as provided in the foregoing sentence, the State committee may, if it determines that such action is required to provide equitable allot<!-- PDFPage:565 -->ments within the State, apportion such unallotted acreage directly to farms to the extent required to provide each farm with the minimum allotment described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Any part of the county allotment heretofore established for the 1954 crop which was not apportioned to farms because of the limitation contained in the proviso in subsection (f)(2) of this section shall be available to the State committee and used as provided above for apportionment of unallotted acreage to farms. The provisions of this subsection, except paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall not apply to extra long staple cotton covered by section 1347 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any part of any farm cotton acreage allotment on which cotton will not be planted and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the allotment to such farm and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving allotments in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable on the basis of past acreage of cotton land, labor, equipment available for the production of cotton, crop rotation practices, and soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of cotton. If all of the allotted acreage voluntarily surrendered is not needed in the county, the county committee may surrender the excess acreage to the State committee to be used for the same purposes as the State acreage reserve under subsection (e) of this section. Any allotment released under this provision shall be regarded for the purposes of establishing future allotments as having been planted on the farm and in the county where the release was made rather than on the farm and in the county to which the allotment was transferred, except that this shall not operate to make the farm from which the allotment was transferred eligible for an allotment as having cotton planted thereon during the three-year base period: <em>Provided</em>, That notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any part of any farm acreage allotment may be permanently released in writing to the county committee by the owner and operator of the farm, and reapportioned as provided herein. Acreage released under this paragraph shall be credited to the State in determining future allotments. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply also to extra long staple cotton covered by section 1347 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or other provision of law, the acreage allotted to any State for 1954 under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection which is less than one hundred thousand acres but more than thirty thousand acres shall be increased by an acreage equal to 15 per centum of the acreage allotted to it prior to January 30, 1954. Such acreage shall be used by the State committee as a reserve to make equitable adjustments in 1954 farm acreage allotments on the basis of land, labor, equipment available for the production of cotton, crop-rotation practices, past acreages of cotton, soil, and other physical factors affecting the production of cotton.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Transfer of farm cotton acreage allotments in case of natural disasters; eligibility for allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the Secretary determines for any year that because of a natural disaster a portion of the farm cotton acreage allotments in a county cannot be timely planted or replanted in such year, he may authorize for such year the transfer of all or a part of the cotton acreage allotment for any farm in the county so affected to another farm in the county or in an adjoining county on which one or more of the producers on the farm from which the transfer is to be made will be engaged in the production of cotton and will share in the proceeds thereof, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. Any farm allotment transferred under this paragraph shall be deemed to be released acreage for purposes of acreage history credits under subsections (f)(8) and (m)(2) of this section, and section 1377 of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (m)(2) of this section, the transfer of any farm allotment under this subsection for any year shall operate to make the farm from which the allotment was transferred eligible for an allotment as having cotton planted thereon during the three-year base period.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority for calendar years 1966 through 1970; transfer periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary, if he determines that it will not impair the effective operation of the program involved, (1) may permit the owner and operator of any farm for which a cotton acreage allotment is established to sell or lease all or any part or the right to all or any part of such allotment (excluding that part of the allotment which the Secretary determines was apportioned to the farm from the national acreage reserve) to any other owner or operator of a farm for transfer to such farm; (2) may permit the owner of a farm to transfer all or any part of such allotment to any other farm owned or controlled by him; <em>Provided</em>, That the authority granted under this section may be exercised for the calendar years 1966 through 1970, but all transfers hereunder shall be for such period of years as the parties thereto may agree.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requisite conditions for transfer of acreage allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Transfers under this section shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) no allotment shall be transferred to a farm in another State or to a person for use in another State; (ii) no farm allotment may be sold or leased for transfer to a farm in another county unless the producers of cotton in the county from which transfer is being made have voted in a referendum within three years of the date of such transfer, by a two-thirds majority of the producers participating in such referendum, to permit the transfer of allotments to farms outside the county, which referendum, insofar as practicable, shall be held in conjunction with the marketing quota referendum for the commodity; (iii) no transfer of an allotment from a farm subject to a mortgage or other lien shall be permitted unless the transfer is agreed to by the lienholder; (iv) no sale of a farm allotment shall be permitted if any sale of cotton allotment to the same farm has been made within the three immediately preceding crop years; (v) the total cotton allotment for any farm to which allotment is transferred by sale or lease shall not exceed the farm acreage allotment (excluding reapportioned acreage) established for such farm for 1965 by more than one hundred acres; (vi) no cotton in excess of the remaining acreage allotment on the farm shall be planted on any farm from which the allotment (or part of an allotment) is sold for a period of five years following such sale, nor shall any cotton in excess of the remaining acreage allotment on the farm be planted on any farm from which the allotment (or part of an allotment) is leased during the period of such lease, and the producer on such farm shall so agree as a condition precedent to the Secretary's approval of any such sale or lease; and (vii) no transfer of allotment shall be effective until a record thereof is filed with the county committee of the county to which such transfer is made and such committee determines that the transfer complies with the provisions of this section. Such record may be filed with such committee <!-- PDFPage:569 -->only during the period beginning June 1 and ending December 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extent of estate transferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The transfer of an allotment shall have the effect of transferring also the acreage history, farm base, and marketing quota attributable to such allotment and if the transfer is made prior to the determination of the allotment for any year the transfer shall include the right of the owner or operator to have an allotment determined for the farm for such year: <em>Provided</em>, That in the case of a transfer by lease, the amount of the allotment shall be considered for purposes of determining allotments after the expiration of the lease to have been planted on the farm from which such allotment is transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Period of ineligibility of land for new allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The land in the farm from which the entire cotton allotment and acreage history have been transferred shall not be eligible for a new farm cotton allotment during the five years following the year in which such transfer is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfer of allotments established under minimum allotment provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The transfer of a portion of a farm allotment which was established under minimum farm allotment provisions for cotton or which operates to bring the farm within the minimum farm allotment provision for cotton shall cause the minimum farm allotment or base to be reduced to an amount equal to the allotment remaining on the farm after such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the administration of this section, which shall include provisions for adjusting the size of the allotment transferred if the farm to which the allotment is transferred has a substantially higher yield per acre and such other terms and conditions as he deems necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Adjustment upon transfer of land covered by conservation reserve contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the sale or lease occurs during a period in which the farm is covered by a conservation reserve contract, cropland conversion agreement, cropland adjustment agreement, or other similar land utilization agreement, the rates of payment provided for in the contract or agreement of the farm from which the transfer is made shall be subject to an appropriate adjustment, but no adjustment shall be made in the contract or agreement of the farm to which the allotment is transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Exchange of cotton acreage allotments for rice acreage allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall by regulations authorize the exchange between farms in the same county, or between farms in adjoining counties within a State, of cotton acreage allotment for rice acreage allotment. Any such exchange shall be made on the basis of application filed with the county committee by the owners and operators of the farms, and the transfer of allotment between the farms shall include transfer of the related acreage history for the commodity. The exchange shall be acre for acre or on such other basis as the Secretary determines is fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the comparative productivity of the soil for the farms involved and other relevant factors. No farm from which the entire cotton or rice allotment has been transferred shall be eligible for an allotment of cotton or rice as a new farm within a period of five crop years after the date of such exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Applicability to cotton restricted to upland cotton</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section relating to cotton shall apply only to upland cotton.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The farm marketing excess of cotton shall be regarded as available for marketing and the amount of penalty shall be computed upon the normal production of the acreage on the farm planted to cotton in excess of the farm acreage allotment. If a downward adjustment in the amount of the farm marketing excess is made pursuant to the proviso in section 1345 of this title, the difference between the amount of the penalty computed upon the farm marketing excess before such adjustment and as computed upon the adjusted farm marketing excess shall be returned to or allowed the producer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The national export market acreage reserve shall be apportioned to farms by the Secretary on the basis of the applications therefor. No application shall be accepted for a greater acreage than is available on the farm for the production of upland cotton. After apportionments are thus made to farms, the Secretary shall provide farm operators a reasonable time in which to cancel their applications (and agreements to forgo price support) and surrender to the Secretary through the county committee the export mar<!-- PDFPage:571 -->ket acreage assigned to the farm. Acreage so surrendered shall be available for reassignment by the Secretary to other eligible farms to which export market acreage has been apportioned on the basis of the applications remaining outstanding. The operator of any farm who elects to forgo price support for any such crop under this subsection shall not be eligible for price support on cotton of such crop produced on any other farm in which he has a controlling or substantial interest as determined by the Secretary. Acreage planted to cotton in excess of the farm acreage allotment established under section 1344 of this title shall not be taken into account in establishing future State, county, and farm acreage allotments. The operator of any farm to which export market acreage is apportioned, or the purchasers of cotton produced on such farm, shall, under regulations issued by the Secretary, furnish a bond or other undertaking prescribed by the Secretary, providing for the exportation, without benefit of any Government cotton export subsidy and within such time as the Secretary may specify, of all cotton produced on such farm for such year. The bond or other undertaking given pursuant to this subsection shall provide that, upon failure to comply with the terms and conditions thereof, the person furnishing such bond or other undertaking shall be liable for liquidated damages in an amount which the Secretary determines and specifies in such undertaking will approximate the amount payable on excess cotton under subsection (a) of this section. The Secretary may, in lieu of the furnishing of a bond or other undertaking, provide for the payment of an amount equal to that which would be payable as liquidated damages under such bond or other undertaking. If such bond or other undertaking is not furnished, or if payment in lieu thereof is not made as provided herein, at such time and in the manner required by regulations of the Secretary, or if the acreage planted to cotton on the farm exceeds the sum of the farm acreage allotment established under section 1344 of this title and the acreage apportioned to the farm from the national export market acreage reserve, the acreage planted to cotton in excess of the farm acreage allotment established under section 1344 of this title shall be regarded as excess acreage for purposes of this section and section 1345 of this title. Amounts collected by the Secretary under this subsection shall be remitted to the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The acreage allotment established under the provisions of section 1344 of this title for each farm for the 1964 crop may be supplemented by the Secretary by an acreage equal to such percentage, but not more than 10 per centum, of such acreage allotment as he determines will not increase the carryover of upland cotton at the beginning of the marketing year for the next succeeding crop above one million bales less than the carryover on the same date one year earlier, if the carryover on such earlier date exceeds eight million bales. For the 1965 crop, the Secretary may, after such hearing and investigation as he finds necessary, announce an export market acreage which he finds will not increase the carryover of upland cotton at the beginning of the marketing year for the next succeeding crop above one million bales less than the carryover on the same date one year earlier, if the carryover on such earlier date exceeds eight million bales. Such export market acreage shall be apportioned to the States on the basis of the State acreage allotments established under section 1344 of this title and apportioned by the States to farms receiving allotments under section 1344 of this title, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary, after considering applications for such acreage filed with the county committee of the county in which the farm is located.

For purposes of sections 1345 and 1374 of this title and the provisions of any law requiring compliance with a farm acreage allotment as a condition of eligibility for price support or payments under any farm program, the farm acreage allotment for farms with export market acreage shall be the sum of the farm acreage allotment established under section 1344 of this title and the maximum export market acreage. Export market acreage shall be in addition to the county, State, and National acreage allotments and shall not be taken into account in establishing future State, county, and farm acreage allotments.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1350. National base acreage allotment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish for each of the 1971 through 1977 crops of upland cotton a national base acreage allotment. Such national base acreage allotment shall be announced not later than November 15 of the calendar year preceding the year for which the national base acreage allotment is to be effective. The national base acreage allotment for any crop of cotton shall be the number of acres which the Secretary determines on the basis of the expected national yield will produce an amount of cotton equal to the estimated domestic consumption of cotton (standard bales of four hundred and eighty pounds net weight) for the marketing year beginning in the year in which the crop is to be produced, plus not to exceed 25 per centum thereof if the Secretary, taking into consideration other actions he may take under the Agricultural Act of 1970, determines that such additional amount is necessary to provide for a production which will equal the national cotton production goal, except that such national base acreage allotment shall be eleven million five hundred thousand acres for the 1971 crop and in the case of the 1972 through 1977 crops shall be in such amount as the Secretary determines necessary to maintain adequate supplies. The national base acreage allotment for the 1974 through 1977 crops shall not be less than eleven million acres.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Apportionment to States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national base acreage allotment for each crop of upland cotton shall be apportioned by the Secretary to the States on the basis of the acreage planted (including acreage regarded as having been planted) to upland cotton within the farm acreage allotment or the farm base acreage allotment, whichever is in effect, during the five calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the national cotton production goal is proclaimed, with adjustments for abnormal weather conditions or other natural disaster during such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Apportionment to counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State base acreage allotment for each crop of upland cotton shall be apportioned to counties on the same basis as to years and conditions as is applicable to the State under subsection (b) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That the State committee may reserve not to exceed 2 per centum of its State acreage allotment which shall be used to make adjustments in county allotments for trends in acreage, for counties adversely affected by abnormal conditions affecting plantings, or for small or new farms, or to correct inequities in farm allotments and to prevent hardships.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adjustment of apportionment bases for counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall adjust the apportionment base for each county as may be necessary because of transfers of allotments across county lines.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Apportionment to farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The county base acreage allotment for the 1971 crop shall be apportioned to old cotton farms in the county on the basis of the domestic acreage allotment established for the farm for the 1970 crop. For the 1972 and each subsequent crop of upland cotton the county base acreage allotment shall be apportioned to old cotton farms in the county on the basis of the farm base acreage allotment established for such farm for the preceding year. The county committee may reserve not in excess of 10 per centum of the county allotment which, in addition to the acreage made available under the proviso in subsection (c) of this section, shall be used for (A) establishing allotments for farms on which cotton was not planted (or regarded as planted) during any of the three calendar years immediately preceding the year for which the allotment is made, on the basis of land, labor, and equipment available for the production of cotton, crop-rotation practices, and the soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of cotton; and (B) making adjustments of the farm allotments established under this para<!-- PDFPage:574 -->graph so as to establish allotments which are fair and reasonable in relation to the factors set forth in this paragraph and abnormal conditions of production on such farms, or in making adjustments in farm allotments to correct inequities and to prevent hardships. No part of such reserve shall be apportioned to a farm to reflect new cropland brought into production after November 30, 1970.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If for any crop the total acreage of cotton planted on a farm is less than the farm base acreage allotment, the farm base acreage allotment used as a base for the succeeding crop shall be reduced by the percentage by which such planted acreage was less than such farm base acreage allotment, but such reduction shall not exceed 20 per centum of the farm base acreage allotment for the preceding crop. If not less than 90 per centum of the base acreage allotment for the farm is planted to cotton, the farm shall be considered to have an acreage planted to cotton equal to 100 per centum of such allotment. For purposes of this paragraph, an acreage on the farm which the Secretary determines was not planted to cotton because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or a condition beyond the control of the producer shall be considered to be an acreage planted to cotton. For the purpose of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, in the event producers of wheat or feed grains are permitted to do so, permit producers of cotton to have acreage devoted to soybeans, wheat, feed grains, guar, castor beans, triticale, oats, rye or such other crops as the Secretary may deem appropriate considered as devoted to the production of cotton to such extent and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines will not impair the effective operation of the cotton or soybean program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If no acreage is planted to cotton for any three consecutive crop years on any farm which had a farm base acreage allotment for such years, such farm shall lose its base acreage allotment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Surrender of farm base acreage allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Effective for the 1971 through 1977 crops, any part of any farm base acreage allotment on which upland cotton will not be planted and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the farm base acreage allotment for such farm and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving farm base acreage allotments in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable on the basis of past acreage of upland cotton, land, labor, equipment available for the production of upland cotton, crop rotation practices, and soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of upland cotton. If all of the acreage voluntarily surrendered is not needed in the county, the county committee may surrender the excess acreage to the State committee to be used to make adjustments in farm base acreage allotments for other farms in the State adversely affected by abnormal conditions affecting plantings or to correct inequities or to prevent hardship. Any farm base acreage allotment released under this provision shall be regarded for the purpose of establishing future farm base acreage allotments as having been planted on the farm and in the county where the release was made rather than on the farm and in the county to which the allotment was transferred: <em>Provided</em>, That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, any part of any farm base acreage allotment for any crop year may be permanently released in writing to the county committee by the owner and operator of the farm and reapportioned as provided herein. Acreage released under this subsection shall be credited to the State in determining future allotments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Compliance with set-aside requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any farm receiving any base acreage allotment through release and reapportionment or sale, lease, or transfer shall, as a condition to the right to receive such allotment, comply with the set-aside requirements of section 1444(e)(4) of this title applicable to such acreage as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Transfer of farm base acreage allotments not planted because of natural disaster or conditions beyond control of producer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the Secretary determines for any year that because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or a condition beyond the control of the producer a portion of the farm base acreage allotment in a county cannot be timely planted or replanted in such year, he may authorize for such year the transfer of all or a part of such cotton acreage for any farm in the county so affected to another farm in the county or in any other nearby county on which one or more of the producers on the farm from which the transfer is to be made will be engaged in the production of upland cotton and will share in the proceeds thereof, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. Any farm base acreage allotment transferred under this subsection shall be regarded as planted to upland cotton on the farm and in the county and State from which transfer is made for purposes of establishing future farm, county and State allotments.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The production, marketing, and processing of peanuts and peanut products employs a large number of persons and is of national interest. The movement of peanuts from producer to consumer is preponderantly in interstate and foreign commerce, and, owing to causes beyond their control, the farmers producing such commodity and the persons engaged in the marketing and processing thereof are unable to regulate effectively the orderly marketing of the commodity. As the quantity of peanuts marketed in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce increases above the quantity of peanuts needed for cleaning and shelling, the prices at which all peanuts are marketed are depressed to low levels. These low prices tend to cause the quantity of peanuts available for marketing in <!-- PDFPage:576 -->later years to be less than normal, which in turn tends to cause relatively high prices. This fluctuation of prices and marketings of peanuts creates an unstable and chaotic condition in the marketing of peanuts for cleaning and shelling and for crushing for oil in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce. Since these unstable and chaotic conditions have existed for a period of years and are likely, without proper regulation, to continue to exist, it is imperative that the marketing of peanuts for cleaning and shelling and for crushing for oil in interstate and foreign commerce be regulated in order to protect producers, handlers, processors, and consumers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Between July 1 and December 1 of each calendar year the Secretary shall proclaim the amount of the national marketing quota for peanuts for the crop produced in the next succeeding calendar year in terms of the total quantity of peanuts which will make available for marketing a supply of peanuts from the crop with respect to which the quota is proclaimed equal to the average quantity of peanuts harvested for nuts during the five years immediately preceding the year in which such quota is proclaimed, adjusted for current trends and prospective demand conditions, and the quota so proclaimed shall be in effect with respect to such crop. The national marketing quota for peanuts for any year shall be converted to a national acreage allotment by dividing such quota by the normal yield per acre of peanuts for the United States determined by the Secretary on the basis of the acreage yield per acre of peanuts in the five years preceding the year in which the quota is proclaimed, with such adjustments as may be found necessary to correct for trends in yields and for abnormal conditions of production affecting yields in such five years: <em>Provided</em>, That the national marketing quota established for the crop produced in the calendar year 1941 shall be a quantity of peanuts sufficient to provide a national acreage allotment of not less than one million six hundred and ten thousand acres, and that the national marketing quota established for any subsequent year shall be quantity of peanuts sufficient to provide a national acreage allotment of not less than that established for the crop produced in the calendar year 1941.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Not later than December 15 of each calendar year the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of farmers engaged in the production of peanuts in the calendar year in which the referendum is held to determine whether such farmers are in favor of or opposed to marketing quotas with respect to the crops of peanuts produced in the three calendar years immediately following the year in which the referendum is held, except that, if as many as two-thirds of the farmers voting in any referendum vote in favor of marketing quotas, no referendum shall be held with respect to quotas for the second and third years of the period. The Secretary shall proclaim the results of the referendum within thirty days after the date on which it is held, and, if more than one-third of the farmers voting in the referendum vote against marketing quotas, the Secretary also shall proclaim that marketing quotas will not be in effect with respect to the crop of peanuts produced in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the referendum is held. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary shall proclaim a national marketing quota with respect to the crop of peanuts produced in the calendar year 1941 equal to the minimum quota provided for said year in subsection (a) of this section and shall provide for the holding of a referendum on such quota within thirty days after April 3, 1941, and the State and farm acreage allotments established under the 1941 agricultural conservation program shall be the State and farm acreage allotments for the 1941 crop of peanuts. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the referendum with respect to marketing quotas for the crops of peanuts produced in the 1986, 1987, and 1988 calendar years may be conducted not later than thirty-one days after adjournment sine die of the first session of the Ninety-ninth Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Apportionment of national acreage allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The national acreage allotment for 1951, less the acreage to be allotted to new farms under subsection (f) of this section, shall be apportioned among the States on the basis of the larger of the following for each State: (a) The acreage allotted to the State as its share of the 1950 national acreage allotment of two million one hundred thousand acres, or (b) the State's share of two million one hundred thousand acres apportioned to States on the basis of the average acreage harvested for nuts in each State in the five years 1945&ndash;1949: <em>Provided</em>, That any allotment so determined for any State which is less than the 1951 State allotment announced by the Secretary prior to February 16, 1938, shall be increased to such announced allotment and the acreage required for such increases shall be in addition to the 1951 national acreage allotment and shall be considered in determining State acreage allotments in future years. For any year subsequent to 1951, the national acreage allotment for that year shall be apportioned among the States on the basis of their share of the national acreage allotment for the most recent year in which such apportionment was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines, on the basis of the average yield per acre of peanuts by types during the preceding five years, adjusted for trends in yields and abnormal conditions of production affecting yields in such five years, that the supply of any type or types of peanuts for any marketing year, beginning with the 1951&ndash;1952 marketing year, will be insuf<!-- PDFPage:577 -->ficient to meet the estimated demand for cleaning and shelling purposes at prices at which the Commodity Credit Corporation may sell for such purposes peanuts owned or controlled by it, the State allotments for those States producing such type or types of peanuts shall be increased to the extent determined by the Secretary to be required to meet such demand but the allotment for any State may not be increased under this provision above the 1947 harvested acreage of peanuts for such State. The total increase so determined shall be apportioned among such States for distribution among farms producing peanuts of such type or types on the basis of the average acreage of peanuts of such type or types in the three years immediately preceding the year for which the allotments are being determined. The additional acreage so required shall be in addition to the national acreage allotment, the production from such acreage shall be in addition to the national marketing quota, and the increase in acreage allotted under this provision shall not be considered in establishing future State, county, or farm acreage allotments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Farm acreage allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide for the apportionment of the State acreage allotment for any State, less the acreage to be allotted to new farms under subsection (f) of this section, through local committees among farms on which peanuts were grown in any of the three years immediately preceding the year for which such allotment is determined. The State acreage allotment for 1952 and any subsequent year shall be apportioned among farms on which peanuts were produced in any one of the three calendar years immediately preceding the year for which such apportionment is made, on the basis of the following: Past acreage of peanuts, taking into consideration the acreage allotments previously established for the farm; abnormal conditions affecting acreage; land, labor, and equipment available for the production of peanuts; crop-rotation practices; and soil and other physical factors affecting the production of peanuts. Any acreage of peanuts harvested in excess of the allotted acreage for any farm for any year shall not be considered in the establishment of the allotment for the farm in succeeding years. The amount of the marketing quota for each farm shall be the actual production of the farm-acreage allotment, and no peanuts shall be marketed under the quota for any farm other than peanuts actually produced on the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) County acreage allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the Secretary may, if the State committee recommends such action and the Secretary determines that such action will facilitate the effective administration of the provisions of this chapter, provide for the apportionment of the State acreage allotment for 1952 and any subsequent year among the counties in the State on the basis of the past acreage of peanuts harvested for nuts (excluding acreage in excess of farm allotments) in the county during the five years immediately preceding the year in which such apportionment is made, with such adjustments as are deemed necessary for abnormal conditions affecting acreage, for trends in acreage, and for additional allotments for types of peanuts in short supply under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. The county acreage allotment shall be apportioned among farms on the basis of the factors set forth in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) New farm allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not more than 1 per centum of the State acreage allotment shall be apportioned among farms in the State on which peanuts are to be produced during the calendar year for which the allotment is made but on which peanuts were not produced during any one of the past three years, on the basis of the following: Past peanut-producing experience by the producers; land, labor, and equipment available for the production of peanuts; crop-rotation practices; and soil and other physical factors affecting the production of peanuts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Release and reapportionment of farm-acreage allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any part of the acreage allotted to individual farms under the provisions of this section on which peanuts will not be produced and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the allotments to such farms and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving allotments, in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable on the basis of land, labor, and equipment available for the production of peanuts, crop-rotation practices, and soil and other physical factors affecting the production of peanuts. Any transfer of allotments under this provision shall not operate to reduce the allotment for any subsequent year for the farm from which acreage is transferred, except as the farm becomes ineligible for an allotment by failure to produce peanuts during a three-year period, and any such transfer shall not operate to increase the allotment for any subsequent year for the farm to which the acreage is transferred: <em>Provided</em>, That, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any part of any farm acreage allotment may be permanently released in writing to the county committee by the owner and operator of the farm, and reapportioned as provided herein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Repealed. Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title III, &sect;378(d), as added Pub. L. 85&ndash;835, title V, &sect;501, Aug. 28, 1958, 72 Stat. 996</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Production on farms with no allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The production of peanuts on a farm in 1959 or any subsequent year for which no farm acreage allotment was established shall not make the farm eligible for an allotment as an old farm under subsection (d) of this section: <em>Provided, however</em>, That by reason of such production the farm need not be considered as ineligible for a new farm allotment under subsection (f) of this section, but such production shall not be deemed past experience in the production of peanuts for any producer on the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Transfer of acreage allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the Secretary determines for 1976 or <!-- PDFPage:578 -->a subsequent year that because of a natural disaster a portion of the farm peanut acreage allotments in a county cannot be timely planted or replanted in such year, he may authorize for such year the transfer of all or a part of the peanut acreage allotments for any farm in the county so affected to another farm in the county or in an adjoining county in the same or an adjoining State on which one or more of the producers on the farm from which the transfer is to be made will be engaged in the production of peanuts and will share in the proceeds thereof, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. Any farm allotment transferred under this subsection shall be deemed to be released acreage for the purpose of acreage history credits under subsection (g) of this section and section 1377 of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, the transfer of any farm allotment under this subsection shall operate to make the farm from which the allotment was transferred eligible for an allotment as having peanuts planted thereon during the three-year base period.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The national poundage quota for peanuts for each marketing year shall be established by the Secretary at a level that is equal to the quantity of peanuts (in tons) that the Secretary estimates will be devoted in each such marketing year to domestic edible use (except seed) and related uses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Announcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The national poundage quota for a marketing year shall be announced by the Secretary not later than December 15 preceding the marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Apportionment among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The national poundage quota established under paragraph (1) shall be apportioned among the States so that the poundage quota allocated to each State shall be equal to the percentage of the national poundage quota allocated to farms in the State for 1990, for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years, and 1995, for the 1996 through 2002 marketing years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Farm poundage quotas</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the poundage quota apportioned to a State under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any such marketing year is larger than the quota for the immediately preceding marketing year, for each other farm on which peanuts were produced for marketing in at least 2 of the 3 immediately preceding crop years, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) as approved and determined by the Secretary under section 1358c of this title, for each farm on which peanuts are produced in connection with experimental and research programs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The farm poundage quota for each marketing year for each farm described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be the same as the farm poundage quota for the farm for the immediately preceding marketing year, as adjusted under paragraph (2), but not including any increases resulting from the allocation of quotas voluntarily released for 1 year under paragraph (7). The farm poundage quota, if any, for each marketing year for each farm described in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be equal to the quantity of peanuts allocated to the farm for the year under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, if the farm poundage quota, or any part thereof, is permanently transferred in accordance with section 1358a or 1358b of this title, the receiving farm shall be considered as possessing the farm poundage quota (or portion thereof) of the transferring farm for all subsequent marketing years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Certain farms ineligible for quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Effective beginning with the 1998 crop, the Secretary shall not establish a farm poundage quota under subparagraph (A) for a farm owned or controlled by&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Allocation of increased quota generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (D), if the poundage quota apportioned to a State under subsection (a)(3) of this section for any marketing year is increased over the poundage quota apportioned to farms in the State for the immediately preceding marketing year, the increase shall be allocated proportionately, based on farm production history for peanuts for the 3 immediately preceding years, among&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) all farms in the State for each of which a farm poundage quota was established for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the allocation is being made; and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Additional quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The temporary allocation of quota pounds under this paragraph shall be in addition to the farm poundage quota otherwise established under this subsection and shall be credited, for the applicable marketing year only, in total, to the producer of the peanuts on the farm in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

Not later than April 1 of each year or as soon as practicable, the tenant's share of any such quota shall be allocated to a farm within the county owned by the tenant or sold by the tenant to the owner of any farm within the county and permanently transferred to that farm.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Transfer of quota from ineligible farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any farm poundage quota held at the end of the 1996 marketing year by a farm described in paragraph (1)(D) shall be allocated to other farms in the same State on such basis as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of this paragraph, the farm poundage quota for any such preceding marketing year shall not include any increase resulting from the allocation of quotas voluntarily released for 1 year under paragraph (7).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Quota considered produced</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the farm poundage quota shall be considered produced on a farm if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Quota permanently released</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the farm poundage quota established for a farm under this subsection, or any part of the quota, may be permanently released by the owner of the farm, or the operator with the permission of the owner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the poundage quota for the farm for which the quota is released shall be adjusted downward to reflect the quota that is so released.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Allocation of quotas reduced or released</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the total quantity of the farm poundage quotas reduced or voluntarily released from farms in a State for any marketing year under paragraphs (3) and (5) shall be allocated, as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, to other farms in the State on which peanuts were produced in at least 2 of the 3 crop years immediately preceding the year for which the allocation is being made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Set-aside for farms with no quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not more than 25 percent of the total amount of farm poundage quota to be allocated in the State under subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to farms in the State for which no farm poundage quota was established for the immediately preceding year's crop. The allocation to any such farm shall not exceed the average farm production of peanuts for the 3 immediately preceding years during which peanuts were produced on the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Allocation of quotas reduced or released in Texas</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In Texas, and subject to terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, beginning with the 1991 marketing year, the total quantity of the farm poundage quota, except the percentage allocated to new farms under subparagraph (B), shall be allocated to other farms having poundage quotas for the 1990 marketing year in all counties in which the production of additional peanuts exceeded the total quota allocated to the county for the 1989 marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Basis for allocation to counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The allocation of the quota to eligible counties shall be based on the total production of additional peanuts in the respective county for the 1988 crop, except that the total quota allocated to any county under this subparagraph and paragraph (2)(B) shall not be increased by more than 100 percent of the basic quota allocated to the county for the 1989 marketing year, if that county had more than 10,000 tons of quota for the 1989 marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Allocation to other counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the total quota for any such county is so increased by 100 percent, all of the remaining quota set aside under this subparagraph shall be allocated to farms in other counties otherwise meeting the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Allocation to eligible farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The percentage of farm poundage quota available for allocation under this subparagraph shall be allocated only to quota farms from which additional peanuts were delivered under contract with handlers for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the allocation is being made. The percentage of the increased quota in each county shall be allocated among the eligible farms in the county on the following basis:</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) Factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">A factor shall be established for each such eligible farm by dividing the amount of additional peanuts contracted and delivered to handlers from the farm by the total remaining peanuts produced on the farm for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the allocation is being made.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Each such eligible farm shall be allocated the percentage of the increased quota for the county as its factor bears to the total of the factors for all eligible farms in the county.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Quota temporarily released</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The farm poundage quota, or any portion thereof, established for a farm for a marketing year may be voluntarily released to the Secretary to the extent that the quota, or any part thereof, will not be produced on the farm for the marketing year. Any farm poundage quota so released in a State shall be allocated to other farms in the State on such basis as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effective period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, any adjustment in the farm poundage quota for a farm under subparagraph (A) shall be effective only for the marketing year for which it is made and shall not be taken into consideration in establishing a farm poundage quota for the farm from which the quota was released for any subsequent marketing year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Disaster transfers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), additional peanuts produced on a farm from which the quota poundage was not harvested and marketed because of drought, flood, or any other natural disaster, or any other condition beyond the control of the producer, may be transferred to the quota loan pool for pricing purposes on such basis as the Secretary shall by regulation provide.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The poundage of peanuts transferred under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed the difference between&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:582 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total quantity of peanuts meeting quality requirements for domestic edible use, as determined by the Secretary, marketed from the farm; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total farm poundage quota, excluding quota pounds transferred to the farm in the fall.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Support rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Peanuts transferred under this paragraph shall be supported at 70 percent of the quota support rate for the marketing years in which the transfers occur. The transfers for a farm shall not exceed 25 percent of the total farm quota pounds, excluding pounds transferred in the fall.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Farm yields</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The yield shall be equal to the average of the actual yield per acre on the farm for each of the 3 crop years in which yields were highest on the farm out of the 5 crop years 1973 through 1977.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appraised yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If peanuts were not produced on the farm in at least 3 years during the 5-year period or there was a substantial change in the operation of the farm during the period (including a change in operator, lessee who is an operator, or irrigation practices), the Secretary shall have a yield appraised for the farm. The appraised yield shall be that quantity determined to be fair and reasonable on the basis of yields established for similar farms that are located in the area of the farm and on which peanuts were produced, taking into consideration land, labor, and equipment available for the production of peanuts, crop rotation practices, soil and water, and other relevant factors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Transfers under this section shall be subject to the following conditions: (1) no allotment shall be transferred to a farm in another county; (2) no transfer of an allotment from a farm subject to a mortgage or other lien shall be permitted unless the transfer is agreed to by the lienholders; (3) no sale of a farm allotment from a farm shall be permitted if any sale of allotment to the same farm has been made within the <!-- PDFPage:584 -->three immediately preceding crop years; (4) no transfer of allotment shall be effective until a record thereof is filed with the county committee of the county in which such transfer is made and such committee determines that the transfer complies with the provisions of this section; and (5) if the normal yield established by the county committee for the farm to which the allotment is transferred does not exceed the normal yield established by the county committee for the farm from which the allotment is transferred by more than 10 per centum, the lease or sale and transfer shall be approved acre for acre, but if the normal yield for the farm to which the allotment is transferred exceeds the normal yield for the farm from which the allotment is transferred by more than 10 per centum, the county committee shall make a downward adjustment in the amount of the acreage allotment transferred by multiplying the normal yield established for the farm from which the allotment is transferred by the acreage being transferred and dividing the result by the normal yield established for the farm to which the allotment is transferred: <em>Provided</em>, That in the event an allotment is transferred to a farm which at the time of such transfer is not irrigated, but within five years subsequent to such transfer is placed under irrigation, the Secretary shall also make an annual downward adjustment in the allotment so transferred by multiplying the normal yield established for the farm from which the allotment is transferred by the acreage being transferred and dividing the result by the actual yield for the previous year, adjusted for abnormal weather conditions, on the farm to which the allotment is transferred: <em>Provided further</em>, That, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the adjustment made in any peanut allotment because of the transfer to a higher producing farm shall not reduce or increase the size of any future National or State allotment and an acreage equal to the total of all such adjustments shall not be allotted to any other farms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transfer of acreage history and marketing quota; transfer by lease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The transfer of an allotment shall have the effect of transferring also the acreage history and marketing quota attributable to such allotment and if the transfer is made prior to the determination of the allotment for any year the transfer shall include the right of the owner or operator to have an allotment determined for the farm for such year: <em>Provided</em>, That in the case of a transfer by lease the amount of the allotment shall be considered, for the purpose of determining allotments after the expiration of the lease, to have been planted on the farm from which such allotment is transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility of transferred land for new allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The land in the farm from which the entire peanut allotment has been transferred shall not be eligible for a new farm peanut allotment during the five years following the year in which such transfer is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Duration of lease; terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any lease may be made for such term of years not to exceed five as the parties thereto agree, and on such other terms and conditions except as otherwise provided in this section as the parties thereto agree.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Lease of part of acreage allotment; determination of future allotments; eligibility for referendum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The lease of any part of a peanut acreage allotment determined for a farm shall not affect the allotment for the farm from which such allotment is transferred or the farm to which it is transferred, except with respect to the crop year or years specified in the lease. The amount of the acreage allotment which is leased from a farm shall be considered for purposes of determining future allotments to have been planted to peanuts on the farm from which such allotment is leased and the production pursuant to the lease shall not be taken into account in establishing allotments for subsequent years for the farm to which such allotment is leased. The lessor shall be considered to have been engaged in the production of peanuts for purposes of eligibility to vote in the referendum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations; limitations on transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the administration of this section which may include reasonable limitation on the size of the resulting allotments on farms to which transfers are made and such other terms and conditions as he deems necessary, but the total peanut allotment transferred to any farm by sale or lease shall not exceed fifty acres.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Adjustment of rates for land utilization agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the sale or transfer occurs during a period in which the farm is covered by a conservation reserve contract, cropland conversion agreement, or other similar land utilization agreement the rates of payment provided for in the contract or agreement of the farm from which the transfer is made shall be subject to an appropriate adjustment, but no adjustment shall be made in the contract or agreement of the farm to which the transfer is made.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sale and lease authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Sale or lease within same State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B) and such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, the owner, or operator with the permission of the owner, of a farm in a State for which a farm poundage quota has been established may sell or lease all or any part of the poundage quota to any other owner or operator of a farm within the same State for transfer to the farm. However, any such lease of poundage quota may be entered into in the fall or after the normal planting season&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if not less than 90 percent of the basic quota (the farm quota and temporary quota transfers), plus any poundage quota transferred to the farm under this subsection, has been planted or considered planted on the farm from which the quota is to be leased; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the case of a fall transfer or a transfer after the normal planting season by a cash lessee, the landowner shall not be required to sign the transfer authorization. A fall transfer or a transfer after the normal planting season may be made not later than 72 hours after the peanuts that are the subject of the transfer are inspected and graded.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Percentage limitations on spring transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Spring transfers under subparagraph (A) by sale or lease of a quota for farms in a county to any owner or operator of a farm outside the county within the same State shall not exceed the applicable percentage specified in this subparagraph of the quotas of all farms in the originating county (as of January 1, 1996) for the crop year in which the transfer is made, plus the total amount of quotas eligible for transfer from the originating county in the preceding crop year that were not transferred in that year or that were transferred through an expired lease. However, not more than an aggregate of 40 percent of the total poundage quota within a county (as of January 1, 1996) may be transferred outside of the county. Cumulative unexpired transfers outside of a county may not exceed for a crop year the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) For the 1996 crop, 15 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) For the 1997 crop, 25 percent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) For the 1999 crop, 35 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) For the 2000 and subsequent crops, not more than an aggregate of 40 percent of the total poundage quota within the county as of January 1, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Clarification regarding fall transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limitation in subparagraph (B) does not apply to 1-year fall transfers, which in all cases may be made to any farm in the same State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Effect of transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any farm poundage quota transferred under this paragraph shall not result in any reduction in the farm poundage quota for the transferring farm if the transferred quota is produced or considered produced on the receiving farm.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfers to other self-owned farms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The owner or operator of a farm may transfer all or any part of the farm poundage quota to any other farm owned or controlled by the owner or operator that is in the same county or in a county contiguous to the county in the same State and that had a farm poundage <!-- PDFPage:586 -->quota for the preceding year's crop. Any farm poundage quota transferred under this paragraph shall not result in any reduction in the farm poundage quota for the transferring farm if the transferred quota is produced or considered produced on the receiving farm.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Transfers in States with small quotas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), in the case of any State for which the poundage quota allocated to the State was less than 10,000 tons for the preceding year's crop, all or any part of a farm poundage quota may be transferred by sale or lease or otherwise from a farm in one county to a farm in another county in the same State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transfers in counties with small quotas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), in the case of any county in a State for which the poundage quota allocated to the county was less than 100,000 pounds for the preceding year's crop, all or any part of a farm poundage quota may be transferred by sale or lease or otherwise from a farm in the county to a farm in another county in the same State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Transfers (including transfer by sale or lease) of farm poundage quotas under this section shall be subject to all of the following conditions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Lienholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No transfer of the farm poundage quota from a farm subject to a mortgage or other lien shall be permitted unless the transfer is agreed to by the lienholders.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tillable cropland</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No transfer of the farm poundage quota shall be permitted if the county committee established under section 590h(b) of title 16 determines that the receiving farm does not have adequate tillable cropland to produce the farm poundage quota.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No transfer of the farm poundage quota shall be effective until a record thereof is filed with the county committee of the county to which the transfer is made and the committee determines that the transfer complies with this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such other terms and conditions that the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Crops</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section shall be effective only for the 1991 through 2002 crops of peanuts.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The marketing of any peanuts in excess of the marketing quota for the farm on which such peanuts are produced, or the marketing of peanuts from any farm for which no acreage allotment was determined, shall be subject to a penalty at a rate equal to 75 per centum of the support price for peanuts for the marketing year (August 1 to July 31). Such penalty shall be paid by the person who buys or otherwise acquires the peanuts from the producer, or, if the peanuts are marketed by the producer through an agent, the penalty shall be paid by such agent, and such person or agent may deduct an amount equivalent to the penalty from the price paid to the producer. The Secretary may require collection of the penalty upon a portion of each lot of peanuts marketed from the farm equal to the proportion which the acreage of peanuts in excess of the farm-acreage allotment is of the total acreage of peanuts on the farm. If the person required to collect the penalty fails to collect such penalty, such person and all persons entitled to share in the peanuts marketed from the farm or the proceeds thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for the amount of the penalty. All funds collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a special deposit account with the Treasurer of the United States and such amounts as are determined, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to be penalties incurred shall be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury of the United States. Amounts collected in excess of determined penalties shall be paid to such producers as the Secretary determines, in accordance with regulations prescribed by him, bore the burden of the payment of the amount collected. Such special account shall be administered by the Secretary and the basis for, the amount of, and the producer entitled to receive a payment from such account, when determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, shall be final and conclusive. Peanuts produced in a calendar year in which marketing quotas are in effect for the marketing year beginning therein shall be subject to such quotas even though the peanuts are marketed prior to the date on which such marketing year begins. If any producer falsely identifies or fails to account for the disposition of any peanuts, an amount of peanuts equal to the normal yield of the number of acres harvested in excess of the farm acreage allotment shall be deemed to have been marketed in excess of the marketing quota for the farm, and the penalty in respect thereof shall be paid and remitted by the producer. If any amount of peanuts produced on one farm is falsely identified by a representation that such peanuts were produced on another farm, the acreage allotments next established for both such farms shall be reduced by that percentage which such amount was of the respective farm marketing quotas, except that such reduction for any such farm shall not be made if the Secretary through the local committees finds that no person connected with such farm caused, aided, or acquiesced in such marketing; and if proof of the disposition of any amount of peanuts is not furnished as required by the Secretary, the acreage allotment next established for the farm on which such peanuts are produced shall be reduced by a percentage similarly computed. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, no refund of any penalty shall be made because of peanuts kept on the farm for seed or for home consumption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The provisions of this subpart shall not apply, beginning with the 1959 crop, to peanuts produced on any farm on which the acreage harvested for nuts is one acre or less provided the producers who share in the peanuts produced on such farm do not share in the peanuts produced on any other farm. If the producers who share in the peanuts produced on a farm on which the acreage harvested for nuts is one acre or less also share in the peanuts produced on other farm(s) the peanuts produced on such farm on <!-- PDFPage:588 -->acreage in excess of the allotment, if any, determined for the farm shall be considered as excess acreage and the marketing penalties provided by subsection (a) of this section shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The word &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; for the purposes of this chapter shall mean all peanuts produced, excluding any peanuts which it is established by the producer or otherwise, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, were not picked or threshed either before or after marketing from the farm, or were marketed by the producer before drying or removal of moisture from such peanuts either by natural or artificial means for consumption exclusively as boiled peanuts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The person liable for payment or collection of the penalty provided by this section shall be liable also for interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date the penalty becomes due until the date of payment of such penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Until the amount of the penalty provided by this section is paid, a lien on the crop of peanuts with respect to which such penalty is incurred, and on any subsequent crop of peanuts subject to marketing quotas in which the person liable for payment or the penalty has an interest shall be in effect in favor of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the beginning of each of the fiscal years 1992 through 1998, the Secretary shall estimate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the quantity of sugar that will be consumed in the United States during the fiscal year (other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in refined form or in sugar containing products) and the quantity of sugar that would provide for reasonable carryover stocks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the quantity of sugar that will be available from carry-in stocks or from domestically-produced sugarcane and sugar beets for consumption in the United States during the year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the quantity of sugar that will be imported for consumption in the United States during the year (other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in a refined form or in sugar containing products), based on the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sum of the quantity of estimated consumption and reasonable carryover stocks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the quantity of sugar estimated to be available from domestically-produced sugarcane and sugar beets and from carry-in stocks.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quarterly reestimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make quarterly reestimates of sugar consumption, stocks, production, and imports for a fiscal year no later than the beginning of each of the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sugar allotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year in which the Secretary estimates, under subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, that imports of sugar for consumption in the United States (other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in refined form or in sugar containing products) will be less than 1,250,000 short tons, raw value, the Secretary shall establish for that year appropriate allotments under section 1359cc of this title for the marketing by processors of sugar processed from domestically-produced sugarcane and sugar beets, at a level that the Secretary estimates will result in imports of sugar of not less than 1,250,000 short tons, raw value, for that year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may include sugar products, whose majority content is sucrose or crystalline fructose for human consumption, derived from sugarcane, sugar beets, molasses or sugar in the allotments under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines it to be appropriate for purposes of this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Crystalline fructose allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any fiscal year in which the Secretary establishes allotments for the marketing of sugar <!-- PDFPage:595 -->under section 1359cc of this title, the Secretary shall establish for that year appropriate allotments for the marketing by manufacturers of crystalline fructose manufactured from corn, at a total level not to exceed the equivalent of 200,000 tons of sugar, raw value, during the fiscal year, in a manner that is fair, efficient, and equitable to manufacturers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prohibitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During any fiscal year or portion thereof for which marketing allotments have been established, no processor of sugar beets or sugarcane shall market a quantity of sugar in excess of the allocation established for such processor, except to enable another processor to fulfill an allocation established for such other processor or to facilitate the exportation of such sugar.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Crystalline fructose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time crystalline fructose allotments are in effect for manufacturers under subsection (c) of this section, no manufacturer may market crystalline fructose in excess of the manufacturer's allotment. No restrictions or allotments shall be established on the marketings of any liquid fructose produced from corn.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any processor who knowingly violates paragraph (1) or manufacturer who knowingly violates paragraph (2) shall be liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty in an amount equal to 3 times the United States market value, at the time of the commission of the violation, of that quantity of sugar or crystalline fructose involved in the violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) &ldquo;Market&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subpart, the term &ldquo;market&rdquo; shall mean to sell or otherwise dispose of in commerce in the United States (including, with respect to any integrated processor and refiner, the movement of raw cane sugar into the refining process).</p>

<!-- PDFPage:596 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Overall allotment quantity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish the overall quantity of sugar to be allotted for the fiscal year (hereafter in this subpart referred to as the &ldquo;overall allotment quantity&rdquo;) by deducting from the sum of the estimated sugar consumption and reasonable carryover stocks (at the end of the fiscal year) for the fiscal year, as determined under section 1359bb(a) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 1,250,000 short tons, raw value; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Percentage factors</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish percentage factors for the overall beet sugar and cane sugar allotments applicable for a fiscal year. The Secretary shall establish the percentage factors in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings of sugar (considering for such purposes the marketings of sugar processed from sugarcane and sugar beets of any or all of the 1985 through 1989 crops), processing and refining capacity, and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall publish these percentage factors in the Federal Register, along with a description of the Secretary's reasons for establishing the factors, as provided in section 1359hh(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Marketing allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The marketing allotment for sugar derived from sugarcane and the marketing allotment for sugar derived from sugar beets for a fiscal year, in each case, shall be a quantity equal to the product of multiplying the overall allotment quantity for the fiscal year by the percentage factor established by the Secretary under subsection (d)(1) of this section for the allotment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State cane sugar allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The allotment for sugar derived from sugarcane shall be further allotted, among the 5 States in the United States in which sugarcane is produced, in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings of sugar (considering for such purposes the average of marketings of sugar processed from sugarcane in the 2 highest years of production from each State from the 1985 through 1989 crops), processing capacity, and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish marketing allotments for the fiscal year or any portion of such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) suspend the allotments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as the Secretary determines appropriate, to reflect changes in estimated sugar consumption, stocks, production, or imports.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation to processors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any increase or decrease in an allotment, each allocation to a processor of the allotment under section 1359dd of this title, and each proportionate share established with respect to the allotment under section 1359ff(b) of this title, shall be increased or decreased by the same percentage that the allotment is increased or decreased.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a marketing allotment for a fiscal year is required to be reduced during the fiscal year under this subsection, if the quantity of sugar marketed, including sugar pledged as collateral for a price support loan under section 1446g&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1359cc_1_target" name="1359cc_1">1</a></sup> of this title, for the fiscal year at the time of the reduction by any individual processor covered by the allotment exceeds the processor's reduced allocation, the allocation of an allotment, if any, next established for the processor shall be reduced by the quantity of the excess sugar marketed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Filling cane sugar and beet sugar allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each marketing allotment for cane sugar established under this section may only be filled with sugar processed from domestically grown sugarcane, and each marketing allotment for beet sugar established under this section may only be filled with sugar processed from domestically grown sugar beets.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Estimates of deficits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time allotments are in effect under this subpart, the Secretary, from time to time, shall determine whether (in view of then-current inventories of sugar, the estimated production of sugar and expected marketings, and other pertinent factors) any processor of sugarcane will be unable to market the sugar covered by <!-- PDFPage:598 -->the portion of the State cane sugar allotment allocated to the processor and whether any processor of sugar beets will be unable to market sugar covered by the portion of the beet sugar allotment allocated to the processor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reassignment of deficits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cane sugar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any sugarcane processor who has been allocated a share of a State cane sugar allotment will be unable to market the processor's allocation of the State's allotment for the fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary first shall reassign the estimated quantity of the deficit to the allocations for other processors within that State, depending on the capacity of each other processor to fill the portion of the deficit to be assigned to it and taking into account the interests of producers served by the processors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if after the reassignments the deficit cannot be completely eliminated, the Secretary shall reassign the estimated quantity of the deficit proportionately to the allotments for other cane sugar States, depending on the capacity of each other State to fill the portion of the deficit to be assigned to it, with the reassigned quantity to each State to be allocated among processors in that State in proportion to the allocations of the processors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if after the reassignments, the deficit cannot be completely eliminated, the Secretary shall reassign the remainder to imports.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Beet sugar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a sugar beet processor who has been allocated a share of the beet sugar allotment will be unable to market that allocation&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1359ff. Provisions applicable to producers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Processor assurances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever allotments for a fiscal year are allocated to processors under section 1359dd of this title, the Secretary shall obtain from the processors such assurances as the Secretary considers adequate that the allocation will be shared among producers served by the processor in a fair and equitable manner that adequately reflects producers&rsquo; production histories. Any dispute between a processor and a producer, or group of producers, with respect to the sharing of the processor's allocation shall be resolved through arbitration by the Secretary on the request of either party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proportionate shares of certain allotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) States affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which a State allotment is established under section 1359cc(f) of this title and there are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in the State (other than Puerto Rico), the Secretary shall make a determination under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall determine, for each State allotment described in subparagraph (A), whether the production of sugarcane, in the absence of proportionate shares, will be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Establishment of proportionate shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that the quantity of sugarcane produced by producers in the area covered by a State allotment for a fiscal year will be in excess of the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment for the fiscal year and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar, the Secretary shall establish a proportionate share for each sugarcane-producing farm that limits the acreage of sugarcane that may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed during the fiscal year the allotment is in effect as provided in this subsection. Each such proportionate share shall be subject to adjustment under paragraph (7) and section 1359cc(g) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of determining</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining proportionate shares for any crop of sugarcane:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary shall establish the State's per-acre yield goal for a crop of sugarcane at a level (not less than the average per-acre yield in the State for the preceding 5 years, as determined by the Sec<!-- PDFPage:599 -->retary) that will ensure an adequate net return per pound to producers in the State, taking into consideration any available production research data that the Secretary considers relevant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Secretary shall adjust the per-acre yield goal by the average recovery rate of sugar produced from sugarcane by processors in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Secretary shall convert the State allotment for the fiscal year involved into a State acreage allotment for the crop by dividing the State allotment by the per-acre yield goal for the State, as established under subparagraph (A) and as further adjusted under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Secretary shall establish a uniform reduction percentage for the crop by dividing the State acreage allotment, as determined for the crop under subparagraph (C), by the sum of all adjusted acreage bases in the State, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The uniform reduction percentage for the crop, as determined under subparagraph (D), shall be applied to the acreage base for each sugarcane-producing farm in the State to determine the farm's proportionate share of sugarcane acreage that may be harvested for sugar or seed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Acreage base</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the acreage base for each sugarcane-producing farm shall be determined by the Secretary, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The acreage base for any farm shall be the number of acres that is equal to the average of the acreage planted and considered planted for harvest for sugar or seed on the farm in each of the 5 crop years preceding the fiscal year the proportionate share will be in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Acreage planted to sugarcane that producers on a farm were unable to harvest to sugarcane for sugar or seed because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers may be considered as harvested for the production of sugar or seed for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Violation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Whenever proportionate shares are in effect in a State for a crop of sugarcane, producers on a farm shall not knowingly harvest, or allow to be harvested, for sugar or seed an acreage of sugarcane in excess of the farm's proportionate share for the fiscal year, or otherwise violate proportionate share regulations issued by the Secretary under section 1359hh(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination of violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No producer shall be considered to have violated subparagraph (A) unless the processor of the sugarcane harvested by such producer from acreage in excess of the proportionate share of the farm markets an amount of sugar that exceeds the allocation of such processor for a fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any producer on a farm who violates subparagraph (A) by knowingly harvesting, or allowing to be harvested, an acreage of sugarcane in excess of the farm's proportionate share shall be liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty equal to one and one-half times the United States market value of the quantity of sugar that is marketed by the processor of such sugarcane in excess of the allocation of such processor for the fiscal year. The Secretary shall prorate penalties imposed under this subparagraph in a fair and equitable manner among all the producers of sugarcane harvested from excess acreage that is acquired by such processor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, the Secretary may authorize the county and State committees established under section 590h(b) of title 16 to waive or modify deadlines and other proportionate share requirements in cases in which lateness or failure to meet the other requirements does not affect adversely the operation of proportionate shares.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary determines that, because of a natural disaster or other condition beyond the control of producers that adversely affects a crop of sugarcane subject to proportionate shares, the amount of sugarcane produced by producers subject to the proportionate shares will not be sufficient to enable processors in the State to meet the State's cane sugar allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar, the Secretary may uniformly allow producers to harvest an amount of sugarcane in excess of their proportionate share, or suspend proportionate shares entirely, as necessary to enable processors to meet the State allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar.</p>
