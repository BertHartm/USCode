<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv)(I) The Commission shall consult with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to any application which is submitted by a board of trade before December 9, 1982, for designation as a contract market with respect to any contract of sale (or option on such contract) for future delivery of a group or index of securities. If, no later than fifteen days following the close of the public comment period, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall object to the designation of a board of trade as a contract market in such contract (or option on such contract) on the ground that any minimum requirement of clause (ii) of this subparagraph is not met, the Commission shall afford the Securities and Exchange Commission an opportunity for an oral hearing, to be transcribed, before the Commission, and shall give appropriate weight to the views of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such oral hearing shall be held after the public comment period, prior to Commission action upon such designation, and not less than thirty nor more than forty-five days after the close of the public comment period, unless both the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission otherwise agree. If such an oral hearing is held, the Securities and Exchange Commission fails to withdraw its objections, and the Commission issues an order designating a board of trade as a contract market with respect to any such contract (or option on such contract), the Securities and Exchange Commission shall have the right of judicial review of such order in accordance with the standards of section 9 of this title. If, pursuant to sections 8 and 9 of this title, there is a hearing on the record with respect to such application for designation, <!-- PDFPage:10 -->the Securities and Exchange Commission shall have the right to participate in that hearing as an interested party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) Effective for any application submitted by a board of trade on or after December 9, 1982, for designation as a contract market with respect to any contract of sale (or option on such contract) for future delivery of a group or index of securities, the Commission shall transmit a copy of such application to the Securities and Exchange Commission for review. The Commission shall not approve any such application if the Securities and Exchange Commission determines that such contract (or option on such contract) fails to meet the minimum requirements set forth in clause (ii) of this subparagraph. Such determination shall be made by order no later than forty-five days after the close of the public comment period under clause (iii) of this subparagraph. In the event of such determination, the board of trade shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing on the record before the Securities and Exchange Commission. If a board of trade requests a hearing on the record, the hearing shall commence no later than thirty days following the receipt of the request, and a final determination shall be made no later than thirty days after the close of the hearing. A person aggrieved by any such order of the Securities and Exchange Commission may obtain judicial review thereof in the same manner and under such terms and conditions as are provided in section 8(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) No person shall offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of any contract of sale (or option on such contract) for future delivery of any security, or interest therein or based on the value thereof, except an exempted security under section 77c of title 15 or section 78c(a)(12) of title 15 as in effect on January 11, 1983 (other than any municipal security as defined in section 78c(a)(29) of title 15 on January 11, 1983), or except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, any group or index of such securities or any interest therein or based on the value thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi)(I) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any contract market in a stock index futures contract (or option thereon) shall file with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any rule establishing or changing the levels of margin (initial and maintenance) for the stock index futures contract (or option thereon).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) The Board may at any time request any contract market to set the margin for any stock index futures contract (or option thereon) at such levels as the Board in its judgment determines are appropriate to preserve the financial integrity of the contract market or its clearing system or to prevent systemic risk. If the contract market fails to do so within the time specified by the Board in its request, the Board may direct the contract market to alter or supplement the rules of the contract market as specified in the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) Subject to such conditions as the Board may determine, the Board may delegate any or all of its authority under this clause only to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) Nothing in this clause shall supersede or limit the authority granted to the Commission in section 12a(9) of this title to direct a contract market, on finding an emergency to exist, to raise temporary emergency margin levels on any futures contract or option on the contract covered by this clause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) Any action taken by the Board, or by the Commission acting under the delegation of authority under subclause III,<sup><a href="#2a_2_target" name="2a_2">2</a></sup> under this clause directing a contract market to alter or supplement a contract market rule shall be subject to review only in the Court of Appeals where the party seeking review resides or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The review shall be based on the examination of all information before the Board or the Commission, as the case may be, at the time the determination was made. The court reviewing the action of the Board or the Commission shall not enter a stay or order of mandamus unless the court has determined, after notice and a hearing before a panel of the court, that the agency action complained of was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Transactions in commodities involving the sale thereof for future delivery as commonly conducted on boards of trade and known as &ldquo;futures&rdquo; are affected with a national public interest. Such futures transactions are carried on in large volume by the public generally and by persons engaged in the business of buying and selling commodities and the products and byproducts thereof in interstate commerce. The prices involved in such transactions are generally quoted and disseminated throughout the United States and in foreign countries as a basis for determining the prices to the producer and the consumer of commodities and the products and byproducts thereof and to facilitate the movements thereof in interstate commerce. Such transactions are utilized by shippers, dealers, millers, and others engaged in handling commodities and the products and byproducts thereof in interstate commerce as a means of hedging themselves against possible loss through fluctuations in price. The transactions and prices of commodities on such boards of trade are susceptible to excessive speculation and can be manipulated, controlled, cornered or squeezed, to the detriment of the producer or the consumer and the persons handling commodities and the products and byproducts thereof in interstate commerce, rendering regulation imperative for the protection of such commerce and the national public interest therein. Furthermore, transactions which are of the character of, or are commonly known to the trade as, &ldquo;options&rdquo; are or may be utilized by commercial and other entities for risk shifting and other purposes. Options transactions are in interstate commerce or affect such commerce and the national economy, rendering regulation of such transactions imperative for the protection of such commerce and the national public interest.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6a. Excessive speculation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Burden on interstate commerce; trading or position limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Excessive speculation in any commodity under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery made on or subject to the rules of contract markets causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of such commodity, is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity. For the purpose of diminishing, eliminating, or preventing such burden, the Commission shall, from time to time, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, by rule, regulation, or order, proclaim and fix such limits on the amounts of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any person under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market as the Commission finds are necessary to diminish, eliminate, or prevent such burden. In determining whether any person has exceeded such limits, the positions held and trading done by any persons directly or indirectly controlled by such person shall be included with the positions held and trading done by such person; and further, such limits upon positions and trading shall apply to positions held by, and trading done by, two or more persons acting pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding, the same as if the positions were held by, or the trading were done by, a single person. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Commission from fixing different trading or position limits for different commodities, markets, futures, or delivery months, or for different number of days remaining until the last day of trading in a contract, or different trading limits for buying and selling operations, or different limits for the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section, or from exempting transactions normally known to the trade as &ldquo;spreads&rdquo; or &ldquo;straddles&rdquo; or &ldquo;arbitrage&rdquo; or from fixing limits applying to such transactions or positions different from limits fixed for other transactions or positions. The word &ldquo;arbitrage&rdquo; in domestic markets shall be defined to mean the same as &ldquo;spread&rdquo; or &ldquo;straddle&rdquo;. The Commission is authorized to define the term &ldquo;international arbitrage&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibition on trading or positions in excess of limits fixed by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, in such rule, regulation, or order, fix a reasonable time (not to ex<!-- PDFPage:18 -->ceed ten days) after the promulgation of the rule, regulation, or order; after which, and until such rule, regulation, or order is suspended, modified, or revoked, it shall be unlawful for any person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) directly or indirectly to buy or sell, or agree to buy or sell, under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of the contract market or markets to which the rule, regulation, or order applies, any amount of such commodity during any one business day in excess of any trading limit fixed for one business day by the Commission in such rule, regulation, or order for or with respect to such commodity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) directly or indirectly to hold or control a net long or a net short position in any commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market in excess of any position limit fixed by the Commission for or with respect to such commodity: <em>Provided</em>, That such position limit shall not apply to a position acquired in good faith prior to the effective date of such rule, regulation, or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicability to bona fide hedging transactions or positions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No rule, regulation, or order issued under subsection (a) of this section shall apply to transactions or positions which are shown to be bona fide hedging transactions or positions as such terms shall be defined by the Commission by rule, regulation, or order consistent with the purposes of this chapter. Such terms may be defined to permit producers, purchasers, sellers, middlemen, and users of a commodity or a product derived therefrom to hedge their legitimate anticipated business needs for that period of time into the future for which an appropriate futures contract is open and available on an exchange. To determine the adequacy of this chapter and the powers of the Commission acting thereunder to prevent unwarranted price pressures by large hedgers, the Commission shall monitor and analyze the trading activities of the largest hedgers, as determined by the Commission, operating in the cattle, hog, or pork belly markets and shall report its findings and recommendations to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Agriculture in its annual reports for at least two years following January 11, 1983.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Persons subject to regulation; applicability to transactions made by or on behalf of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply to a person that is registered as a futures commission merchant, an introducing broker, or a floor broker under authority of this chapter only to the extent that transactions made by such person are made on behalf of or for the account or benefit of such person. This section shall not apply to transactions made by, or on behalf of, or at the direction of, the United States, or a duly authorized agency thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rulemaking power of contract markets and penalties for violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall prohibit or impair the adoption by any contract market or by any other board of trade licensed or designated by the Commission of any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution fixing limits on the amount of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any person under contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery traded on or subject to the rules of such contract market, or under options on such contracts or commodities traded on or subject to the rules of such contract market or such board of trade: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Commission shall have fixed limits under this section for any contract or under section 6c of this title for any commodity option, then the limits fixed by the bylaws, rules, regulations, and resolutions adopted by such contract market or such board of trade shall not be higher than the limits fixed by the Commission. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to violate any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution of any contract market or other board of trade licensed or designated by the Commission fixing limits on the amount of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any person under contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery or under options on such contracts or commodities, if such bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution has been approved by the Commission: <em>Provided</em>, That the provisions of section 13(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6a_1_target" name="6a_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall apply only to those who knowingly violate such limits.</p>

The application shall be made in such form and manner as prescribed by the Commission, giving such information and facts as the Commission may deem necessary concerning the business in which the applicant is or will be engaged, including in the case of an application of a futures commission merchant or an introducing broker, the names and addresses of the managers of all branch offices, and the names of such officers and partners, if a partnership, and of such officers, directors, and stockholders, if a corporation, as the Commission may direct. Such person, when registered hereunder, shall likewise continue to report and furnish to the Commission the above-mentioned information and such other information pertaining to such person's business as the Commission may require. Each registration shall expire on December 31 of the year for which issued or at such other time, not less than one year from the date of issuance, as the Commission may by rule, regulation, or order prescribe, and shall be renewed upon application therefor unless the registration has been suspended (and the period of such suspension has not expired) or revoked pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Financial requirements for futures commission merchants and introducing brokers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no person desiring to register as futures commission merchant or as introducing broker shall be so registered unless he meets such minimum financial requirements as the Commission may by regulation prescribe as necessary to insure his meeting his obligation as a registrant, and each person so registered shall at all times continue to meet such prescribed minimum financial requirements: <em>Provided</em>, That such minimum financial requirements will be considered met if the applicant for registration or registrant is a member of a contract market and conforms to minimum financial standards and related reporting requirements set by such contract market in its bylaws, rules, regulations, or resolutions and approved by the Commission as adequate to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Risk assessment for holding company systems</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The records required under subparagraph (A) shall describe, in the aggregate, each of the futures and other financial activities conducted by, and the customary sources of capital and funding of, those of its affiliated persons whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of the futures commission merchant, including its adjusted net capital, its liquidity, or its ability to conduct or finance its operations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A),<sup><a href="#6f_1_target" name="6f_1">1</a></sup> If, as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) or other available information, the Commission reasonably concludes that the Commission has concerns regarding the financial or operational condition of any registered futures commission merchant, the Commission may require the futures commission merchant to make reports concerning the futures and other financial activities of any of such person's affiliated persons, other than a natural person, whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of the futures commission merchant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission, in requiring reports pursuant to this paragraph, shall specify the information required, the period for which it is required, the time and date on which the information must be furnished, and whether the information is to be furnished directly to the Commission or to a contract market or other self-regulatory organization with primary responsibility for examining the registered futures commission merchant's financial and operational condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6f_2_target" name="6f_2">2</a></sup> developing and implementing reporting requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) with respect to affiliated persons subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall consult with and consider the views of each such Federal banking agency. If a Federal banking agency comments in writing on a proposed rule of the Commission under this subsection that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to the written comment before adopting the proposed rule. The Commission shall, at the request of the Federal banking agency, publish the comment and response in the Federal Register at the time of publishing the adopted rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), a registered futures commission merchant shall be considered to have compiled&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6f_3_target" name="6f_3">3</a></sup> with a recordkeeping or reporting requirement adopted pursuant to paragraph (2) concerning an affiliated person that is subject to examination by, or reporting requirements of, a Federal banking agency if the futures commission merchant utilizes for the recordkeeping or reporting requirement copies of reports filed by the affiliated person with the Federal banking agency pursuant to section 161 of title 12, section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 321 et seq.), section 1817(a) of title 12, section 1467a(b) of title 12, or section 1844 of title 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Commission may, by rule adopted pursuant to paragraph (2), require any futures commission merchant filing the reports with the Commission to obtain, maintain, or report supplemental information if the Commission makes an explicit finding that the supplemental information is necessary to inform the Commission regarding potential risks to the futures commission merchant.

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Prior to making a request pursuant to paragraph (3) for information with respect to an affiliated person that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the agency of the information required with respect to the affiliated person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consult with the agency to determine whether the information required is available from the agency and for other purposes, unless the Commission determines that any delay resulting from the consultation would be inconsistent with ensuring the financial and operational condition of the futures commission merchant or the stability or integrity of the futures markets.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the Commission to require any futures commission merchant to obtain, maintain, or furnish any examination report of any Federal banking agency or any supervisory recommendations or analysis contained in the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) No information provided to or obtained by the Commission from any Federal banking agency pursuant to a request under paragraph (5) regarding any affiliated person that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency may be disclosed to any other person (other than as provided in section 12 of this title or section 12a(6) of this title), without the prior written approval of the Federal banking agency.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:26 --><p class="statutory-body">(8) The Commission shall notify a Federal banking agency of any concerns of the Commission regarding significant financial or operational risks resulting from the activities of any futures commission merchant to any affiliated person thereof that is subject to examination by or reporting requirements of the Federal banking agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the primary business of any affiliated person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the nature and extent of domestic or foreign regulation of the affiliated person's activities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(10) Information required to be provided pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to section 12 of this title. Except as specifically provided in section 12 of this title and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission shall not be compelled to disclose any information required to be reported under this subsection, or any information supplied to the Commission by any domestic or foreign regulatory agency that relates to the financial or operational condition of any affiliated person of a registered futures commission merchant.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Dual trading prohibited; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall issue regulations to prohibit the privilege of dual trading on each contract market which has not been exempted from such regulations under paragraph (3). The regulations issued by the Commission under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall provide that the prohibition of dual trading thereunder shall take effect not less than thirty days after the issuance of the regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall provide for exceptions, as the Commission determines necessary and appropriate, <!-- PDFPage:29 -->to ensure fairness and orderly trading in affected contract markets, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) transition measures and a reasonable phase-in period,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) exceptions for spread transactions and the correction of trading errors,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) allowance for a customer to designate in writing not less than once annually a named floor broker to execute orders for such customer, notwithstanding the regulations to prohibit the privilege of dual trading required under this paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) other measures reasonably designed to accommodate unique or special characteristics of individual boards of trade or contract markets, to address emergency or unusual market conditions, or otherwise to further the public interest;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall establish procedures for the application for and issuance of exemptions under paragraph (3) which, among other things, shall specify the relevant data required to be submitted by the board of trade with each application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall specify the methodology by which it shall determine the average daily trading volume on a contract market for purposes of paragraph (4) based on a moving daily average of either six or twelve months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) shall establish an expeditious procedure to revoke an exemption granted under paragraph (3) providing sufficient notice, opportunity for hearing, and findings to assure fundamental fairness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this section, the term &ldquo;dual trading&rdquo; means the execution of customer orders by a floor broker during any trading session in which the floor broker executes any trade in the same contract market for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the account of such floor broker;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an account for which such floor broker has trading discretion; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an account controlled by a person with whom such floor broker is subject to trading restrictions under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall exempt a contract market from the regulations issued under paragraph (1), either unconditionally or on stated conditions (including stated periods of time) relevant to the attainment or maintenance of compliance with the standards in subparagraphs (A) and (B), upon finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the trade monitoring system in place at the contract market satisfies the requirements of section 7a(b) of this title with regard to violations attributable to dual trading at such contract market; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) there is a substantial likelihood that a dual trading suspension would harm the public interest in hedging or price basing at such contract market, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) other corrective actions, such as those described in section 12e of this title, are sufficient and appropriate to bring the contract market into compliance with the standard in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The regulations issued by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall not apply to any contract market in which the Commission determines that the average daily trading volume is less than the threshold trading level established for the contract market under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The threshold trading level shall be set initially at eight thousand contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission may, by rule or order&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the threshold trading level for specific contract markets after taking into consideration the actual or potential effects of a dual trading ban on the public interest in hedging or price basing at the affected contract market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Commission shall provide the affected contract market with adequate notice of any such increase or decrease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Before the Commission denies an application for an exemption under paragraph (3) or exempts a contract market subject to conditions, it shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide the affected board of trade with notice of the reason or reasons that the application was not approved as submitted, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any reason the Commission has to believe that the trade monitoring system in place at the contract market does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (3)(A) and the basis for such reason;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any corrective action or actions, such as those described in section 12e of this title, that the Commission believes the affected contract market must take to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (3)(A), and an acceptable timetable for such corrective action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any conditions or limitations that the Commission proposes to attach to the exemption under paragraph (3);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide the affected board of trade with an opportunity for a hearing through submission of written data, views, or arguments and, under terms set by the Commission at the request of the board of trade, through an oral presentation of views and comments to the Commission, in order to make the demonstration required under paragraph (3) or otherwise to petition the Commission with respect to its application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make findings, based on the information, views, and arguments placed before it in connection with the application, as to whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the standard in either paragraph (3)(A) or (3)(B) applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any conditions or limitations which the Commission proposes to attach under paragraph (3) are appropriate in light of the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall publish in the Federal Register notice of any exemptive petitions filed under paragraph (3) and any proposed or final actions the Commission may take on such petitions. Unless the Commission determines that more immediate action is appropriate in the public interest, any Commission order denying an application or exempting a contract market conditionally shall not take effect for at least twenty days following the issuance of the order.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:30 --><p class="statutory-body">(6) Violation of an order issued under this subsection shall be considered a violation of an order of the Commission for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) establishing liability and assessing penalties against a contract market or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof under section 13a or 13a&ndash;1 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) initiating proceedings under section 7b or 8(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any board of trade which has applied to the Commission to exempt a contract market from the regulations issued under paragraph (1) may obtain judicial review of any final action of the Commission to deny such application, to issue an exemption subject to conditions, or to revoke an exemption, only in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the party seeking review resides or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, under the standards applicable to rulemaking proceedings under section 553 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) The Commission shall issue the regulations required under paragraph (1) not later than two hundred and seventy days after October 28, 1992. If, prior to the effective date of the prohibition on dual trading under such regulations, a board of trade submits to the Commission an application for an exemption for a contract market under paragraph (3), the Commission shall not apply the prohibition against dual trading under paragraph (1) to the contract market until the Commission has approved or denied the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall approve or deny any application for an exemption under paragraph (3) within seventy-five days after receipt of the application, or as soon as practicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Trades and executions by floor brokers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in addition to the regulations issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Commission has reason to believe that dual trading-related or facilitated abuses are not being or cannot be effectively addressed by subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall make a determination, after notice and opportunity for hearing, whether or not a floor broker may trade for his own account or any account in which such broker has trading discretion, and also execute a customer's order for future delivery and, if the Commission determines that such trades and such executions shall be permitted, the Commission shall further determine the terms, conditions, and circumstances under which such trades and such executions shall be conducted: <em>Provided</em>, That any such determination shall, at a minimum, take into account the effect upon the liquidity of trading of each market: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Commission from making separate determinations for different contract markets when such are warranted in the judgment of the Commission, or to prohibit contract markets from setting terms and conditions more restrictive than those set by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Trades by futures commission merchants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall within nine months after the effective date of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974, and subsequently when it determines that changes are required, make a determination, after notice and opportunity for hearing, whether or not a futures commission merchant may trade for its own account or any proprietary account, as defined by the Commission, and if the Commission determines that such trades shall be permitted, the Commission shall further determine the terms, conditions, and circumstances under which such trades shall be conducted: <em>Provided</em>, That any such determination, at a minimum, shall take into account the effect upon the liquidity of trading of each market: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Commission from making separate determinations for different contract markets when such are warranted in the judgment of the Commission, or to prohibit contract markets from setting terms and conditions more restrictive than those set by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restrictions on trading among members of broker associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a floor broker may not execute an order of a customer if such floor broker knows the opposite party to the transaction to be a floor broker or floor trader with whom such trader or broker has a relationship involving trading on such contract market as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a partner in a partnership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an employer or employee; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the Commission has adopted rules that the Commission certifies to Congress require procedures and standards designed to prevent violations of this chapter attributable to the trading described in paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to any contract market that has implemented rules designed to prevent violations of this chapter attributable to the trading described in paragraph (1), except that, if the Commission determines, by rule or order, that such rules are not adequate to prevent such violations, paragraph (1) shall become effective with respect to such contract market after a reasonable period determined by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Commission may specify by rules and regulations appropriate standards with respect to training, experience, and such other qualifications as the Commission finds necessary or desirable to insure the fitness of persons required to be registered with the Commission. In connection therewith, the Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations the adoption of written proficiency examinations to be given to applicants for registration and the establishment of reasonable fees to be charged to such applicants to cover the administration of such examinations. The Commission may further prescribe by rules and regulations that, in lieu of examinations administered by the Commission, futures associations registered under section 21 <!-- PDFPage:35 -->of this title or contract markets may adopt written proficiency examinations to be given to applicants for registration and charge reasonable fees to such applicants to cover the administration of such examinations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Commission may specify by rules and regulations such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate to protect the public interest wherein exception to any written proficiency examination shall be made with respect to individuals who have demonstrated, through training and experience, the degree of proficiency and skill necessary to protect the interests of customers, clients, pool participants, or other members of the public with whom such individuals deal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission shall issue regulations to require new registrants, within six months after receiving such registration, to attend a training session, and all other registrants to attend periodic training sessions, to ensure that registrants understand their responsibilities to the public under this chapter, including responsibilities to observe just and equitable principles of trade, any rule or regulation of the Commission, any rule of any appropriate contract market, registered futures association, or other self-regulatory organization, or any other applicable Federal or state&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6p_1_target" name="6p_1">1</a></sup> law, rule or regulation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) When located at a terminal market where any cash commodity of the kind specified in the contracts of sale of commodities for future delivery to be executed on such board is sold in sufficient volumes and under such conditions as fairly to reflect the general value of the commodity and the differences in value between the various grades of such commodity, and where there is available to such board of trade, official inspection service approved by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commission for the purpose: <em>Provided</em>, That any board of trade not so located shall be designated as a &ldquo;contract market&rdquo; if such board of trade provides for the delivery of commodities on such contracts at a delivery point or points and upon terms and conditions approved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) When the governing board thereof provides for the making and filing by the board or any member thereof, as the Commission may direct, of reports in accordance with the rules and regulations, and in such manner and form and at such times as may be prescribed by the Commission, showing the details and terms of all transactions entered into by the board, or the members thereof, either in cash transactions or transactions for future delivery consummated on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, and when such governing board provides, in accordance with such rules and regulations, for the keeping of a record by the board or the members of the board of trade, as the Commission may direct, showing the details and terms of all cash and future transactions entered into by them, consummated on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, such record to be in permanent form, showing the parties to all such transactions, including the persons for whom made, any assignments or transfers thereof, with the parties thereto, and the manner in which said transactions are fulfilled, discharged, or terminated. Such record shall be required to be kept for a period of three years from the date thereof, or for a longer period if the Commission shall so direct, and shall at all times be open to the inspection of any representative of the Commission or United States Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) When the governing board thereof provides for the prevention of dissemination by the board or any member thereof of false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of any commodity in interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) When the governing board thereof provides for the prevention of manipulation of prices and the cornering of any commodity by the dealers or operators upon such board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) When the governing board thereof does not exclude from membership in and all privileges on such board of trade any duly author<!-- PDFPage:36 -->ized representative of any lawfully formed and conducted cooperative association of producers having adequate financial responsibility which is engaged in any cash commodity business, if such association has complied, and agrees to comply, with such terms and conditions as are or may be imposed lawfully on other members of such board: <em>Provided</em>, That no rule of a contract market shall forbid or be construed to forbid the return on a patronage basis by such cooperative association to its bona fide members of moneys collected in excess of the expense of conducting the business of such association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) When the governing board provides for making effective the final orders or decisions entered pursuant to the provisions of section 9 of this title, and the orders issued pursuant to the provisions of section 7a of this title, and for compliance in all other respects with the requirements applicable to such board of trade under this chapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each contract market shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promptly furnish the Commission copies of all bylaws, rules, regulations, and resolutions made or issued by it or by the governing board thereof or any committee, and of all changes and proposed changes therein;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) keep all books, records, minutes, and journals of proceedings of such contract market, and its governing board, committees, subsidiaries, and affiliates in a manner that will clearly describe all matters discussed by such contract market, governing board, committees, subsidiaries and affiliates and reveal any action taken in such matters, and allow inspection at all times by any authorized representative of the Commission or United States Department of Justice of all such books, records, minutes, and journals of proceedings. Such books, records, minutes, and journals of proceedings shall be kept for a period of three years from the date thereof, or for a longer period if the Commission shall so direct;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require the operators of warehouses in which or out of which any commodity is deliverable on any contract for future delivery made on or subject to the rules of such contract market, to make such reports, keep such records, and permit such warehouse visitation as the Commission may prescribe. Such books and records shall be required to be kept for a <!-- PDFPage:37 -->period of three years from the date thereof, or for a longer period if the Commission shall so direct, and such books, records, and warehouses shall be open at all times to inspection by any representative of the Commission or United States Department of Justice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) when so directed by order of the Commission, provide for a period, after trading in contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery in a delivery month has ceased, during which contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery in such month may be satisfied by the delivery of the actual cash commodity. Whenever, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that provision for such a period of delivery for any one or more commodities or markets would prevent or tend to prevent &ldquo;squeezes&rdquo; and market congestion endangering price stability, it shall, by order, require such period of delivery (which shall be not less than three nor more than ten business days) applicable to such commodities and markets as it finds will prevent or tend to prevent such &ldquo;squeezes&rdquo; and market congestion: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such order shall not apply to then existing contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) require the party making delivery of any commodity on any contract of sale of such commodity for future delivery to furnish the party obligated under the contract to accept delivery, written notice of the date of delivery at least one business day prior to such date of delivery. Whenever, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that the giving of longer notice of delivery is necessary to prevent or diminish unfair practices in trading in any one or more commodities or markets, it shall by order require such longer notice of delivery (which shall be not more than ten business days) applicable to such commodities and markets as it finds will prevent or diminish such unfair practices: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such order shall not apply to then existing contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) require that all contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery on such contract market shall provide for the delivery thereunder of commodities of grades conforming to United States standards, if such standards shall have been officially promulgated and adopted by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) require that receipts issued under the United States Warehouse Act [7 U.S.C. 241 et seq.] shall be accepted in satisfaction of any futures contract, made on or subject to the rules of such contract market, without discrimination and notwithstanding that the warehouseman issuing such receipts is not also licensed as a warehouseman under the laws of any state or enjoys other or different privileges than under State law: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such receipts shall be for the kind, quality, and quantity of commodity specified in such contract and that the warehouse in which the commodity is stored meets such reasonable requirements as may be imposed by such contract market on other warehouses as to location, accessibility, and suitability for warehousing and delivery purposes: <em>And provided further</em>, That this paragraph shall apply only to futures contracts for those commodities which may be delivered from a warehouse subject to the United States Warehouse Act;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) enforce all bylaws, rules, regulations, and resolutions, made or issued by it or by the governing board thereof or any committee, that (i) have been approved by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (12) of this section, (ii) have become effective under such paragraph, or (iii) must be enforced pursuant to any Commission rule, regulation, or order; and revoke and not enforce any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution, made, issued, or proposed by it or by the governing board thereof or any committee, which has been disapproved by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) enforce all bylaws, rules, regulations, and resolutions made or issued by it or by the governing board thereof or by any committee, which provide minimum financial standards and related reporting requirements for futures commission merchants who are members of such contract market, and which have been approved by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) permit the delivery of any commodity, on contracts of sale thereof for future delivery, of such grade or grades, at such point or points and at such quality and locational price differentials as will tend to prevent or diminish price manipulation, market congestion, or the abnormal movement of such commodity in interstate commerce. If the Commission after investigation finds that the rules and regulations adopted by a contract market permitting delivery of any commodity on contracts of sale thereof for future delivery, do not accomplish the objectives of this paragraph, then the Commission shall notify the contract market of its findings and afford the contract market an opportunity to make appropriate changes in such rules and regulations. If the contract market within seventy-five days of such notification fails to make the changes which in the opinion of the Commission are necessary to accomplish the objectives of this paragraph, then the Commission after granting the contract market an opportunity to be heard, may change or supplement such rules and regulations of the contract market to achieve the above objectives: <em>Provided</em>, That any order issued under this paragraph shall not apply to contracts of sale for future delivery in any months in which contracts are currently outstanding and open: <em>And provided further</em>, That no requirement for an additional delivery point or points shall be promulgated following hearings until the contract market affected has had notice and opportunity to file exceptions to the proposed order determining the location and number of such delivery point or points;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) provide a fair and equitable procedure through arbitration or otherwise (such as by delegation to a registered futures association having rules providing for such procedures) for the settlement of customers&rsquo; claims and grievances against any member or employee thereof: <em>Provided</em>, That (A) the use of such procedure by a customer shall be voluntary, (B) the term &ldquo;customer&rdquo; as used in this paragraph shall not include another member of the con<!-- PDFPage:38 -->tract market, and (C) in the case of a claim arising from a violation in the execution of an order on the floor of a contract market, such procedure shall provide, to the extent appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for payment of actual damages proximately caused by such violation. If an award of actual damages is made against a floor broker in connection with the execution of a customer order, and the futures commission merchant which selected the floor broker for the execution of the customer order is held to be responsible under sections 2, 2a, and 4 of this title for the floor broker's violation, such futures commission merchant may be required to satisfy such award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) where the violation is willful and intentional, for payment to the customer of punitive or exemplary damages, in addition to losses proximately caused by the violation, in an amount equal to no more than two times the amount of such losses. If punitive or exemplary damages are awarded against a floor broker in connection with the execution of a customer order, and the futures commission merchant which selected the floor broker for the execution of such order is held to be responsible under sections 2, 2a, and 4 of this title for the floor broker's violation, such futures commission merchant may be required to satisfy the award of punitive or exemplary damages if the floor broker fails to do so, except that such requirement shall apply to the futures commission merchant only if it willfully and intentionally selected the floor broker with the intent to assist or facilitate the floor broker's violation;;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7a_1_target" name="7a_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12)(A) except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, submit to the Commission for its prior approval all bylaws, rules, regulations, and resolutions (&ldquo;rules&rdquo;) made or issued by such contract market, or by the governing board thereof or any committee thereof, that relate to terms and conditions in contracts of sale to be executed on or subject to the rules of such contract market, as such terms and conditions are defined by the Commission by rule or regulation, except those rules relating to the setting of levels of margin. Each contract market shall submit to the Commission all other rules (except those relating to the setting of levels of margin and except those that the Commission may specify by regulation) and may make such rules effective ten days after receipt of such submission by the Commission unless, within the ten-day period, the contract market requests review and approval thereof by the Commission or the Commission notifies such contract market in writing of its determination to review such rules for approval. The determination to review such rules for approval shall not be delegable to any employee of the Commission. At least thirty days before approving any rules of major economic significance, as determined by the Commission, the Commission shall publish a notice of such rules in the Federal Register. The Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the approval process through the submission of written data, views, or arguments. The determination by the Commission whether any such rules are of major economic significance shall be final and not subject to judicial review. The Commission shall approve such rules if such rules are determined by the Commission not to be in violation of this chapter or the regulations of the Commission and the Commission shall disapprove, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, any such rule which the Commission determines at any time to be in violation of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations of the Commission. If the Commission institutes proceedings to determine whether a rule should be disapproved pursuant to this paragraph, it shall provide the contract market with written notice of the proposed grounds for disapproval, including the specific sections of this chapter or the Commission's regulations which would be violated. At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Commission shall approve or disapprove such rule. Any disapproval shall specify the sections of this chapter or the Commission's regulations which the Commission determines such rule has violated or, if effective, would violate. If the Commission does not approve or institute disapproval proceedings with respect to any rule within one hundred and eighty days after receipt or within such longer period as the contract market may agree to, or if the Commission does not conclude a disapproval proceeding with respect to any rule within one year after receipt or within such longer period as the contract market may agree to, such rule may be made effective by the contract market until such time as the Commission disapproves such rule in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The Commission shall issue regulations to specify the terms and conditions under which, in an emergency as defined by the Commission, a contract market may, by a two-thirds vote of its governing board, make a rule (hereinafter referred to as an &ldquo;emergency rule&rdquo;) effective on a temporary basis without prior Commission approval, or without compliance with the ten-day notice requirement under subparagraph (A), or during any period of review by the Commission, if the contract market makes every effort practicable to notify the Commission of such emergency rule, along with a complete explanation of the emergency involved, prior to making the emergency rule effective. If the contract market does not provide the Commission with such notification and explanation before making the emergency rule effective, the contract market shall provide the Commission with such notification and explanation at the earliest possible date. The Commission may delegate the power to receive such notification and explanation to such individuals as the Commission determines necessary and appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Within ten days of the receipt from a contract market of notification of such an emergency rule and an explanation of the <!-- PDFPage:39 -->emergency involved, or as soon as practicable, the Commission shall determine whether it is appropriate either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) to permit such rule to remain in effect during the pendency of the emergency, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) to suspend the effect of such rule pending review either under the procedures of subparagraph (A) or otherwise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission shall submit a report on its determination and the basis thereof with respect to such emergency rule to the affected contract market, to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate. If the report is submitted more than ten days after the Commission's receipt of notification of such an emergency rule from a contract market, the report shall explain why submission within such ten-day period was not practicable.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the volume of trading on such exchange is relatively small and the exchange has demonstrated substantial compliance with the objectives of such paragraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the trade monitoring system at such exchange otherwise maintains a high level of compliance with this subsection; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to the extent determined appropriate by the Commission, for categories of customer orders with respect to which the Commission finds that such orders are transmitted to and reported from the trading pit in an extremely rapid manner such that substantial compliance with the objectives of paragraph (3) can be otherwise achieved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i)(I) the Commission shall find that the volume of trading at an exchange is relatively small if, among other things, the Commission determines that the average daily trading volume for each contract market for which the board of trade is designated is less than the threshold trading level established for the contract market under section 6j(a)(4) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any rule or order adopted by the Commission under paragraphs (4) and (5) shall become effective thirty legislative days or ninety calendar days, whichever is later, after submission of such rule or order to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;legislative day&rdquo; means any day on which either House of Congress is in session.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any board of trade desiring to be designated a &ldquo;contract market&rdquo; shall make application to the Commission for such designation and accompany the same with a showing that it complies with the conditions of section 7 of this title, and with a sufficient assurance that it will continue to comply with the requirements of such section 7. The Commission shall approve or deny an application for designation as a contract market within one year of the filing of the application. If the Commission notifies the board of trade that its application is materially incomplete and specifies the deficiencies in the application, the running of the one-year period shall be stayed from the time of such notification until the application is resubmitted in completed form: <em>Provided</em>, That the Commission shall have not less than sixty days to approve or deny the application from the time the application is resubmitted in completed form. If the Commission denies an application, it shall specify the grounds for the denial. In the event of a refusal to designate as a &ldquo;contract market&rdquo; any board of trade that has made application therefor, such board of trade shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing on the record before the Commission, with the right to appeal an adverse decision after such hearing to the court of appeals as provided for in other cases in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission is authorized to suspend for a period not to exceed six months or to revoke the designation of any board of trade as a &ldquo;contract market&rdquo; upon a showing that such board of trade is not enforcing or has not enforced its rules of government made a condition of its designation as set forth in section 7 of this title or that such board of trade, or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof, otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or any of the rules, regulations, or orders of the Commission or the Commission&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8_1_target" name="8_1">1</a></sup> thereunder. Such suspension or revocation shall only be after a notice to the officers of the board of trade affected and upon a hearing on the record: <em>Provided</em>, That such suspension or revocation shall be final and conclusive, unless within fifteen days after such suspension or revocation by the Commission such board of trade appeals to the court of appeals for the circuit in which it has its principal place of business, by filing with the clerk of such court a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition, together with a bond in such sum as the court may determine, conditioned that such board of trade will pay the costs of the proceedings if the court so directs. The clerk of the court in which such a petition is filed shall immediately cause a copy thereof to be delivered to the Commission and file in the court the record in such proceedings, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The testimony and evidence taken or submitted before the Commission, duly filed as aforesaid as a part of the record, shall be considered by the court of appeals as the evidence in the case. Such a court may affirm or set aside the order of the Commission or may direct it to modify its order. No such order of the Commission shall be modified or set aside by the court of appeals unless it is shown by the board of trade that the order is unsupported by the weight of the evidence or was issued without due <!-- PDFPage:44 -->notice and a reasonable opportunity having been afforded to such board of trade for a hearing, or infringes the Constitution of the United States, or is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>

Said hearing may be held in Washington, District of Columbia, or elsewhere, before the Commission, or before an Administrative Law Judge designated by the Commission, which Administrative Law Judge shall cause all evidence to be reduced to writing and forthwith transmit the same to the Commission. Upon evidence received, the Commission may (1) prohibit such person from trading on or subject to the rules of any contract market and require all contract markets to refuse such person all trading privileges thereon for such period as may be specified in the order, (2) if such person is registered with the Commission in any capacity, suspend, for a period not to exceed six months, or revoke, the registration of such person, (3) assess such person a civil penalty of not more than the higher of $100,000 or triple the monetary gain to such person for each such violation&nbsp;<sup><a href="#9_2_target" name="9_2">2</a></sup> and (4) require restitution to customers of damages proximately caused by violations of such persons. Notice of such order shall be sent forthwith by registered mail or by certified mail or delivered to the offending person and to the governing boards of said contract markets. After the issuance of the order by the Commission, the person against whom it is issued may obtain a review of such order or such other equitable relief as to the court may seem just by filing in the United States court of appeals of the circuit in which the petitioner is doing business, or in the case of an order denying registration, the circuit in which the petitioner's principal place of business listed on petitioner's application for registration is located, a written petition, within fifteen days after the notice of such order is given to the offending person praying that the order of the Commission be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record theretofore made, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of the petition the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm, to set aside, or modify the order of the Commission, and the findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by the weight of evidence, shall in like manner be conclusive.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;546, &sect;&sect;209(a)(1), 212(b), 223, 402(1)(C), (6), substituted, in first sentence, &ldquo;Commission thereunder&rdquo; for &ldquo;commission thereunder&rdquo;, in sentence beginning &ldquo;Upon evidence received&rdquo;, inserted &ldquo;(1)&rdquo;, substituted &ldquo;(2) if&rdquo; for &ldquo;and, if&rdquo;, &ldquo;suspend&rdquo; for &ldquo;may suspend&rdquo;, &ldquo;(3)&rdquo; for &ldquo;and may&rdquo;, &ldquo;the higher of $100,000 or triple the monetary gain to such person&rdquo; for &ldquo;$100,000&rdquo;, and inserted before period &ldquo;and (4) require restitution to customers of damages proximately caused by violations of such persons&rdquo;, and in sentence beginning &ldquo;After the issuance&rdquo;, substituted &ldquo;offending person&rdquo; for &ldquo;offending person.&rdquo;.</p>

Section 103(a) was executed wherever the term &ldquo;Secretary of Agriculture&rdquo; appeared in this section including in the phrase &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo; in the first sentence. Because the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; was not capitalized in that phrase in the first sentence, section 103(b) did not apply to that phrase and therefore section 103(a) was executed, resulting in the substitution of &ldquo;the Commission or the commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1968&mdash;Pub.

If such contract market, director, officer, agent, or employee, after the entry of such a cease and desist order and the lapse of the period allowed for appeal of such order or after the affirmance of such order, shall fail or refuse to obey or comply with such order, such contract market, director, officer, agent, or employee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $500,000 or imprisoned for not less than six months nor more than one year, or both. Each day during which such failure or refusal to obey such cease and desist order continues shall be deemed a separate offense. If the offending contract market or other person upon whom such penalty is imposed, after the lapse of the period allowed for appeal or after the affirmance of such penalty, shall fail to pay such penalty, the Commission shall refer the matter to the Attorney General who shall recover such penalty by action in the appropriate United States district court. In determining the amount of the money penalty assessed under this section, the Commission shall consider the gravity of the offense, and in the case of a contract market shall further consider whether the amount of the penalty will materially impair the contract market's ability to carry on its operations and duties.</p>

<p class="note-body">1992&mdash;Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 102&ndash;546, &sect;402(9)(C), which directed that &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or&rdquo; be struck out, could not be executed because of amendment by Pub. L. 93&ndash;463, &sect;103(a). See 1974 Amendment note below.</p>

Because the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; was not capitalized in the text of this section, section 103(b) did not apply to this section and therefore section 103(a) was executed, resulting in the substitution of &ldquo;the Commission or the commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo;.</p>

Such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or Administrative Law Judge or other officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining, pursuant to the provisions of this section, what markets are bona fide spot markets, the Secretary is directed to consider only markets in which spot cotton is sold in such volume and under such conditions as customarily to reflect accurately the value of middling cotton and the differences between the prices or values of middling cotton and of other grades of cotton for which standards shall have been established by the Secretary; except that if there are not sufficient places, in the markets of which are made bona fide sales of spot cotton of grades for which standards are established by the Secretary, to enable him to designate at least five spot markets in accordance with subsection (f)(3) of this section, he shall, from data as to spot sales collected by him, make rules and regulations for determining the actual commercial differences in the value of spot cotton of the grades established by him as reflected by bona fide sales of spot cotton, of the same or different grades, in the market selected and designated by him, from time to time, for that purpose, and in that event differences in value of cotton of various grades involved in contracts made pursuant to subsection (f)(1) and (2) of this section shall be determined in compliance with such rules and regulations.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Withholding information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person engaged in the business of dealing in cotton who shall, within a reasonable time prescribed by the Secretary or any agent acting under his instructions, willfully fail or refuse to answer questions or to produce books, letters, papers, or documents, as required under paragraph (2) of this subsection, or who shall willfully give any answer that is false or misleading, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition for actual damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person complaining of any violation of any provision of this chapter, or any rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant to this chapter, by any person who is registered under this chapter may, at any time within two years after the cause of action accrues, apply to the Commission for an order awarding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) actual damages proximately caused by such violation. If an award of actual damages is made against a floor broker in connection with the execution of a customer order, and the futures commission merchant which selected the floor broker for the execution of the customer order is held to be responsible under sections 2, 2a, and 4 of this title for the floor broker's violation, such futures commission merchant may be required to satisfy such award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any action arising from a willful and intentional violation in the execution of an order on the floor of a contract market, punitive or exemplary damages equal to no more than two times the amount of such actual damages. If an award of punitive or exemplary damages is made against a floor broker in connection with the execution of a customer order, and the futures commission merchant which selected the floor broker for the execution of the customer order is held to be responsible under sections 2, 2a, and 4 of this title for the floor broker's violation, such futures commission merchant may be required to satisfy such award if the floor broker fails to do so, except that such requirement shall apply to the futures commission merchant <!-- PDFPage:75 -->only if it willfully and intentionally selected the floor broker with the intent to assist or facilitate the floor broker's violation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An action may be brought under this subsection by any one or more persons described in this subsection for and in behalf of such person or persons and other persons similarly situated, if the Commission permits such actions pursuant to a final rule issued by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than two hundred and seventy days after October 28, 1992, the Commission shall propose and publish for public comment such rules as are necessary to carry out subparagraph (A). In developing such rules, the Commission shall consider the potential impact of such actions on resources available to the reparations system established under this chapter and the relative merits of bringing such actions in Federal court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules and regulations; control over right of appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may promulgate such rules, regulations, and orders as it deems necessary or appropriate for the efficient and expeditious administration of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such rules, regulations, and orders may prescribe, or otherwise condition, without limitation, the form, filing, and service of pleadings or orders, the nature and scope of discovery, counterclaims, motion practice (including the grounds for dismissal of any claim or counterclaim), hearings (including the waiver thereof, which may relate to the amount in controversy), rights of appeal, if any, and all other matters governing proceedings before the Commission under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Bond requirement when complainant is nonresident; waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case a complaint is made by a nonresident of the United States, the complainant shall be required, before any formal action is taken on his complaint, to furnish a bond in double the amount of the claim conditioned upon the payment of costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee for the respondent if the respondent shall prevail, and any reparation award that may be issued by the Commission against the complainant on any counterclaim by respondent: <em>Provided</em>, That the Commission shall have authority to waive the furnishing of a bond by a complainant who is a resident of a country which permits the filing of a complaint by a resident of the United States without the furnishing of a bond.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement of reparation award</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person against whom an award has been made does not pay the reparation award within the time specified in the Commission's order, the complainant, or any person for whose benefit such order was made, within three years of the date of the order, may file a certified copy of the order of the Commission, in the district court of the United States for the district in which he resides or in which is located the principal place of business of the respondent, for enforcement of such reparation award by appropriate orders. The orders, writs, and processes of such district court may in such case run, be served, and be returnable anywhere in the United States. The petitioner shall not be liable for costs in the district court, nor for costs at any subsequent state of the proceedings, unless they accrue upon his appeal. If the petitioner finally prevails, he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee, to be taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit. Subject to the right of appeal under subsection (e) of this section, an order of the Commission awarding reparations shall be final and conclusive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any order of the Commission entered hereunder shall be reviewable on petition of any party aggrieved thereby, by the United States Court of Appeals for any circuit in which a hearing was held, or if no hearing was held, any circuit in which the appellee is located, under the procedure provided in section 9 of this title. Such appeal shall not be effective unless within 30 days from and after the date of the reparation order the appellant also files with the clerk of the court a bond in double the amount of the reparation awarded against the appellant conditioned upon the payment of the judgment entered by the court, plus interest and costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee for the appellee, if the appellee shall prevail. Such bond shall be in the form of cash, negotiable securities having a market value at least equivalent to the amount of bond prescribed, or the undertaking of a surety company on the approved list of sureties issued by the Treasury Department of the United States. The appellee shall not be liable for costs in said court. If the appellee prevails, he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee to be taxed and collected as a part of his costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Automatic bar from trading and suspension for noncompliance; effect of appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the party against whom a reparation order has been issued shows to the satisfaction of the Commission within fifteen days from the expiration of the period allowed for compliance with such order that either an appeal as herein authorized has been taken or payment of the full amount of the order (or any agreed settlement thereof) has been made, such party shall be prohibited automatically from trading on all contract markets and, if the party is registered with the Commission, such registration shall be suspended automatically at the expiration of such fifteen-day period until such party shows to the satisfaction of the Commission that payment of such amount with interest thereon to date of payment has been made: <em>Provided</em>, That if on appeal the appellee prevails or if the appeal is dismissed, the automatic prohibition against trading and suspension of registration shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days from the date of judgment on the appeal, but if the judgment is stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the suspension shall become effective ten days after the expiration of such stay, unless prior thereto the judgment of the court has been satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not become effective until fifteen months after October 23, 1974: <em>Provided</em>, That claims which arise <!-- PDFPage:76 -->within one year immediately prior to the effective date of this section may be heard by the Commission after such 15-month period.</p>

If such an order is the final decision of the futures association, any person against whom the order has been issued may petition the Commission to review the decision. The Commission may on its own initiative or upon petition decline review or grant review and affirm, set aside, or modify such an order of the futures association; and the findings of the futures association as to the facts, if supported by the weight of the evidence, shall be conclusive. Unless the Commission grants review under this section of an order concerning registration issued by a futures association, the order of the futures association shall be considered to be an order issued by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall affect the Commission's authority to review the granting of a registration application by a registered futures association that is performing any Commission registration function authorized by the Commission under section 12a(10) of this title, this section, or any other applicable provision of this chapter.</p>
