Such agreements may provide for commodities to be furnished on a multiyear basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether to enter into an agreement under this section, the President shall consider whether a potential recipient country is committed to carry out, or is carrying out, policies that promote economic freedom, private, domestic production of food commodities for domestic consumption, and the creation and expansion of efficient domestic markets for the purchase and sale of such commodities. Such policies may provide for, among other things&mdash;</p>
