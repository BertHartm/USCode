<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that there is increasing evidence of a relationship between diet and many of the leading causes of death in the United States: that improved nutrition is an integral component of preventive health care; that there is a serious need for research on the chronic effects of diet on degenerative diseases and related disorders; that nutrition and health considerations are important to United States agricultural policy; that there is insufficient knowledge concerning precise human nutritional requirements, the interaction of the various nutritional constituents of food, and differences in nutritional requirements among different population groups such as infants, children, adolescents, elderly men and women, and pregnant women; and that there is a critical need for objective data concerning food safety, the potential of food enrichment, and means to encourage better nutritional practices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared to be the policy of the United States that the Department of Agriculture conduct research in the fields of human nutrition and the nutritive value of foods and conduct human nutrition education activities, as provided in this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Although medical researchers in recent years have demonstrated that there are several naturally occurring compounds in many vegetables and fruits that can aid in the prevention of certain forms of cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and atherosclerosis, there has been almost no research conducted to enhance these compounds in food plants by modern breeding and molecular genetic methods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) By linking the appropriate medical and agricultural research scientists in a highly-focused, targeted research program, it should be possible to develop new varieties of vegetables and fruits that would provide greater prevention of diet-related diseases that are a major cause of death in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Pilot research program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct, through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, a pilot research program to link major cancer and heart and other circulatory disease research efforts with agricultural research efforts to identify compounds in vegetables and fruits that prevent these diseases. Using information derived from such combined research efforts, the Secretary shall assist in the development of new varieties of vegetables and fruits having enhanced therapeutic properties for disease prevention.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program through agreements entered into with land-grant colleges or universities, other universities, State agricultural experiment stations, the State cooperative extension services, nonprofit organizations with demonstrable expertise, or Federal or State governmental entities. The Secretary shall enter into the agreements on a competitive basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 4 per centum shall be available to the Secretary for administrative, technical, and other services necessary for the administration of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The remainder shall be allocated among the States as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 10 per centum shall be distributed equally among all States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the remainder shall be allocated to each State in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this subparagraph as the population of the State living at or below 125 per centum of the income poverty guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (adjusted pursuant to section 9902(2) of title 42), bears to the total population of all the States living at or below 125 per centum of the income poverty guidelines, as determined by the last preceding decennial census at the time each such additional amount is first appropriated. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not preclude the Secretary from developing educational materials and programs for persons in income ranges above the level designated in this subparagraph.</p>
