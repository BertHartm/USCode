<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall, jointly with the Secretary of Labor, implement two pilot projects involving the performance of work in return for food stamp benefits in each of the seven administrative regions of the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture, such projects to be (A) appropriately divided in each region between locations that are urban and rural in characteristics and among locations selected to provide a representative cross-section of political subdivisions in the States and (B) submitted for approval prior to project implementation, together with the names of the agencies or organizations that will be engaged in such projects, to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate. Under such pilot projects, any person who is subject to the work registration requirements pursuant to section 2015(d) of this title, and is a member of a household that does not have earned income equal to or exceeding the allotment to which the household is otherwise entitled pursuant to section 2017(a) of this title, shall be ineligible to participate in the food stamp program as a member of any household during any month in which such person refuses, after not being offered employment in the private sector of the economy for more than thirty days (ten days in at least one pilot project area designated by the Secretary) after the initial registration for employment referred to in section 2015(d)(1)(A)(i) of this title, to accept an offer of employment from a political subdivision or provider pursuant to a program carried out under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] or title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.], for which employment compensation shall be paid in the form of the allotment to which the household is otherwise entitled pursuant to section 2017(a) of this title, with each hour of employment entitling the household to a portion of the allotment equal in value to 100 per centum of the Federal minimum hourly rate under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)); which employment shall not, together with any other hours worked in any other capacity by such person exceed forty hours a week; and which employment shall not be used by the employer to fill a job opening created by the action of such employer in laying off or terminating the employment of any regular employee not supported under this paragraph in anticipation of filling the vacancy so created by hiring an employee or employees to be supported under this paragraph, if all of the jobs supported under the program have been made available to participants in the program before the political subdivision or provider providing the jobs extends an offer of employment under this paragraph, and if the political subdivision or provider, in employing the person, complies with the requirements of Federal law <!-- PDFPage:1076 -->that relate to the program. The Secretary and the Secretary of Labor shall jointly issue reports to the appropriate committees of Congress on the progress of such pilot projects no later than six and twelve months following September 29, 1977, shall issue interim reports no later than October 1, 1979, October 1, 1980, and March 30, 1981, shall issue a final report describing the results of such pilot projects based upon their operation from their commencement through the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, and shall pay to the agencies or organizations operating such pilot projects 50 per centum of all administrative costs involved in such operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary may conduct demonstration projects to test improved consistency or coordination between the food stamp employment and training program and the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program under title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may, as part of a project authorized under this paragraph, waive requirements under section 2015(d) of this title to permit a State to operate an employment and training program for food stamp recipients on the same terms and conditions under which the State operates its Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program for recipients of aid to families with dependent children under part F&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2026_1_target" name="2026_1">1</a></sup> of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 681 et seq.). Any work experience program conducted as part of the project shall be conducted in conformity with section 482(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2026_1_target" name="2026_1">1</a></sup> of such Act (42 U.S.C. 682(f)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A State seeking such a waiver shall provide assurances that the resulting employment and training program shall meet the requirements of subsections (a)(19) and (g) of section 402&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2026_1_target" name="2026_1">1</a></sup> of such Act (42 U.S.C. 602) (but not including the provision of transitional benefits under clauses (ii) through (vii) of section 402(g)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2026_1_target" name="2026_1">1</a></sup>) and sections 481 through 487&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2026_1_target" name="2026_1">1</a></sup> of such Act (42 U.S.C. 681 through 687). Each reference to &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; in such sections shall be deemed to be a reference to food stamps for purposes of the demonstration project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, participation in an employment and training activity in which food stamp benefits are converted to cash shall occur only with the consent of the participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) For the purposes of any project conducted under this paragraph, the provisions of this chapter affecting the rights of recipients may be waived to the extent necessary to conform to the provisions of section 402, and sections 481 through 487,<sup><a href="#2026_1_target" name="2026_1">1</a></sup> of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) At least 60 days prior to granting final approval of a project under this paragraph, the Secretary shall publish the terms and conditions for any demonstration project conducted under the paragraph for public comment in the Federal Register and shall notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Waivers may be granted under this paragraph to conduct projects at any one time in a total of up to 60 project areas (or parts of project areas), as such areas are defined in regulations in effect on January 1, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H) A waiver for a change in program rules may be granted under this paragraph only for a demonstration project that has been approved by the Secretary, that will be evaluated according to criteria prescribed by the Secretary, and that will be in operation for no more than 4 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I) The Secretary may not grant a waiver under this paragraph on or after August 22, 1996. Any reference in this paragraph to a provision of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] shall be deemed to be a reference to such provision as in effect on the day before August 22, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Evaluation measures; pilot programs for nutritional monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop and implement measures for evaluating, on an annual or more frequent basis, the effectiveness of the food stamp program in achieving its stated objectives, including, but not limited to, the program's impact upon the nutritional and economic status of participating households, the program's impact upon all sectors of the agricultural economy, including farmers and ranchers, as well as retail food stores, and the program's relative fairness to households of different income levels, different age composition, different size, and different regions of residence. Further, the Secretary shall, by way of making contracts with or grants to public or private organizations or agencies, implement pilot programs to test various means of measuring on a continuing basis the nutritional status of low income people, with special emphasis on people who are eligible for food stamps, in order to develop minimum common criteria and methods for systematic nutrition monitoring that could be applied on a nationwide basis. The locations of the pilot programs shall be selected to provide a representative geographic and demographic cross-section of political subdivisions that reflect natural usage patterns of health and nutritional services and that contain high proportions of low income people. The Secretary shall report on the progress of these pilot programs on an annual basis commencing on July 1, 1982, to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate, together with such recommendations as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
