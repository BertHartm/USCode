<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the national centers for agricultural product quality research shall be to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) serve as regional or commodity specific agricultural product quality research and education focal points involving one or more university and Federal participants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) take advantage of opportunities, and establish linkages between universities and other entities with expertise, in basic biology and engineering, the development of new technology, the application of technology to practice, and related quality assurance and regulatory activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) develop and enhance explicit relationships (including the possible sharing of the cost of center operations) between the research and development community, the Department, and other Federal agencies, and with all aspects of the involved industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide a mechanism for dealing with the safety and wholesomeness of new food products and processes that use biotechnology (including transgenic plants and animals);</p>
