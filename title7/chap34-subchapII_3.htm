Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any price restrictions that may otherwise apply to the disposition of agricultural commodities by the Commodity Credit Corporation shall not apply to the redemption of certificates under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever base acreages are in effect for corn, the Secretary shall require, as a condition of eligibility for price support on corn, that the producer (1) devote an acreage of cropland (tilled in normal rotation), at the option of the producer, to either the acreage reserve program for corn or the conservation reserve program, equal to 15 per centum of such producer's farm base acreage for corn, and (2) not exceed such farm base acreage for corn: <em>Provided,</em> That price support may be made available to any producer who does not meet the foregoing requirements at such level, not in excess of the level of price support to producers who meet such requirements, as the Secretary determines will facilitate the effective operation of the price support program. Corn acreage allotments shall not be effective for the 1956 crop.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Referendum of producers of corn</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than December 15, 1956, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of producers of corn in 1956 in the commercial corn-producing area to determine whether such producers favor a price-support program as provided in subsection (c) of this section for the 1957 and subsequent crops in lieu of acreage allotments as provided in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.], and price support as provided in section 1441 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restriction on acreage allotment of corn; price support level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if two-thirds or more of the producers voting in the referendum conducted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section favor a price-support program as provided in this subsection, no acreage allotment of corn shall be established for the commercial corn-producing area for any county, or for any farm, with respect to the 1957 and subsequent crops, and price support made available for such crops by Commodity Credit Corporation shall be at such level as the Secretary determines will assist producers in marketing corn in the normal channels of trade but not encourage the uneconomic production of corn.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Price support level for 1956 and 1957 crops of grain sorghums, barley, rye, oats, and corn</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, (1) the level of price support for the 1956 crop of grain sorghums, barley, rye, and oats, respectively, shall be 76 per centum of the parity price for the commodity as of May 1, 1956, (2) the level of price support for corn produced outside the commercial corn-producing area, for any crop for which base acreages are in effect (except as provided in (3) below), shall be 821/2 per centum of the level of price support for corn in the commercial corn-producing area to producers complying with acreage limitations, and (3) if price support is made available for the 1957 crop of corn in the commercial corn-producing area to producers not complying with acreage limitations, price support shall be made available for the 1957 crop of grain sorghums, barley, rye, oats, and corn produced outside the commercial corn-producing area, respectively, at a level, not less than 70 per centum of the parity price as of the beginning of the marketing year, determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable in relation to the level at which price support is made available for corn in the commercial corn-<!-- PDFPage:666 -->producing area to producers not complying with acreage limitations, taking into consideration the normal price relationships between such commodity and corn in the commercial area, the feed value of such commodity in relation to corn, the supply of such commodity in relation to the demand therefor, and the ability to dispose of stocks of such commodity acquired through price support programs.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Basic support levels for 1961 and subsequent years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1441 of this title, price support to cooperators for each crop of upland cotton, beginning with the 1961 crop, for which producers have not disapproved marketing quotas shall be at such level not more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor nor less than the minimum level prescribed below as the Secretary determines appropriate after consideration of the factors specified in section 1421(b) of this title. For the 1961 crop the minimum level shall be 70 per centum of the parity price therefor, and for each subsequent crop the minimum level shall be 65 per centum of the parity price therefor: <em>Provided,</em> That the price support for the 1965 crop shall be a national average support price which reflects 30 cents per pound for Middling one-inch cotton. Price support in the case of noncooperators and in case marketing quotas are disapproved shall be as provided in section 1441(d)(3) and (5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional support levels for 1964 and 1965</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If producers have not disapproved marketing quotas, the Secretary shall provide additional price support on the 1964 and 1965 crops of upland cotton to cooperators on whose farms the acreage planted to upland cotton for harvest does not exceed the farm domestic allotment established under section 1350 of this title. Such additional support shall be at a level up to 15 per centum in excess of the basic level of support established under subsection (a) of this section and shall be provided on the normal yield of the acreage planted for harvest within the farm domestic allotment. For purposes of this subsection, an acreage on the farm which the Secretary finds was not planted to cotton in 1965 because of flood, drought, or other natural disaster shall be deemed by the Secretary to be an actual acreage of cotton planted on the farm for harvest, provided such acreage is not subsequently devoted to any price supported crop for 1965.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Alternative operations for carrying out additional price support; payment-in-kind certificates: value, marketing assistance, redemption, and deductions after thirty day period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to keep upland cotton to the maximum extent practicable in the normal channels of trade, any additional price support under subsection (b) of this section may be carried out through the simultaneous purchase of cotton at the support price therefor under subsection (b) of this section and the sale of such cotton at the support price therefor under subsection (a) of this section or similar operations, including loans under which the cotton would be redeemable by payment of the amount for which the cotton would be redeemable if the loan thereon had been made at the support price for such cotton under subsection (a) of this section, or payments-in-kind through the issuance of certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation shall redeem for cotton under regulations issued by the Secretary. If such additional support is provided through the issuance of payment-in-kind certificates, such certificates shall have a value per pound of cotton equal to the difference between the level of support established under subsection (a) of this section and the level of support established under subsection (b) of this section. The corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producers and persons receiving payment-in-kind certificates under this section and section 1348 of this title, in the marketing of such certificates at such time and in such manner as the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the program authorized by this section and such section 1348. In the case of any certificate not presented for redemption within thirty days of the date of its issuance, reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges as determined by the Secretary for the period beginning thirty days after its issuance and ending with the date of its presentation for redemption shall be deducted from the value of the certificate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Price support and diversion payments for 1966 through 1970 crops</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if producers have not disapproved marketing quotas, price support and diversion payments shall be made available for the 1966 through 1970 crops of upland cotton as provided in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Price support for each such crop of upland cotton shall be made available to cooperators through loans at such level, not exceeding a <!-- PDFPage:667 -->level which will reflect for Middling one-inch upland cotton at average location in the United States 90 per centum of the estimated average world market price for Middling one-inch upland cotton for the marketing year for such crop, as the Secretary determines will provide orderly marketing of cotton during the harvest season and will retain an adequate share of the world market for cotton produced in the United States taking into consideration the factors specified in section 1421(b) of this title: <em>Provided,</em> That the national average loan rate for the 1966 crop shall reflect 21 cents per pound for Middling one-inch upland cotton.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary also shall provide additional price support for each such crop through payments in cash or in kind to cooperators at a rate not less than 9 cents per pound: <em>Provided,</em> That the rate shall be such that the amount obtained by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) multiplying the rate by the farm domestic acreage allotment percentage, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) dividing the product thus obtained by the cooperator percentage established under section 1428(b) of this title, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">shall not be less than 65 per centum or more than 90 per centum of the parity price for cotton as of the month in which the payment rate provided for by this paragraph is announced. Such payments shall be made on the quantity of cotton determined by multiplying the projected farm yield by the acreage planted to cotton within the farm domestic acreage allotment: <em>Provided,</em> That any such farm planting not less than 90 per centum of such domestic acreage allotment shall be deemed to have planted the entire amount of such allotment. An acreage on a farm in any such year which the Secretary finds was not planted to cotton because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster shall be deemed to be planted to cotton for purposes of payments under this subsection if such acreage is not subsequently devoted to any other crop for which there are marketing quotas or voluntary adjustment programs in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall make diversion payments in cash or in kind in addition to the price support payments authorized in paragraph (3) to cooperators who reduce their cotton acreage by diverting a portion of their cotton acreage allotment from the production of cotton to approved conservation practices to the extent prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided,</em> That no reduction below the domestic acreage allotments established under section 1350 of this title shall be prescribed: <em>Provided further,</em> That payment under this paragraph shall be made available for diverting to conserving uses that part of the acreage allotment which must be diverted from cotton in order that the producer may qualify as a cooperator. The rate of payment for acreage required to be diverted in order to qualify as a cooperator shall not be less than 25 per centum of the parity price for upland cotton as of the month in which such rate is announced. The rate of payment for additional acreage diverted shall be such rate as the Secretary determines to be fair and reasonable, but shall not exceed 40 per centum of such parity price. Payment at each applicable rate shall be made on the quantity of cotton determined by multiplying the acreage diverted from the production of cotton at such rate by the projected farm yield. In addition to the foregoing payment, if any, payment at the rate applicable for acreage required to be diverted to qualify as a cooperator shall be made to producers on small farms as defined in section 1428(b) of this title who do not exceed their farm acreage allotments on a quantity of cotton determined by multiplying an acreage equal to 35 per centum of such farm acreage allotment by the projected farm yield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of the payments under this subsection to producers in advance of determination of performance and the balance of such payments shall be made at such time as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Where the farm operator elects to participate in the diversion program authorized in this subsection and no acreage is planted to cotton on the farm, diversion payments shall be made at the rate established under paragraph (4) for acreage required to be diverted to qualify as a cooperator on the quantity of cotton determined by multiplying that part of the farm acreage allotment required to be diverted to qualify as a cooperator by the projected farm yield, and the remainder of such allotment may be released under the provisions of section 1344(m)(2) of this title. The acreage on which payment is made under this paragraph shall be regarded as planted to cotton for purposes of establishing future State, county, and farm acreage allotments, and farm bases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Payments in kind under this subsection shall be made through the issuance of certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation shall redeem for cotton under regulations issued by the Secretary at a value per pound equal to not less than the current loan rate therefor. The Corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producers in the marketing of such certificates at such times and in such manner as the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the program authorized by this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Payments under this subsection shall be conditioned on the farm having an acreage of approved conservation uses equal to the sum of (i) the reduction in cotton acreage required to qualify for such payments (hereinafter called &ldquo;diverted acreage&rdquo;), and (ii) the average acreage of cropland on the farm devoted to designated soil-conserving crops or practices, including summer fallow and idle land, during a base period prescribed by the Secretary: <em>Provided,</em> That the Secretary may permit all or any part of such diverted acreage to be devoted to the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, and flaxseed, if he determines that such production is necessary to provide an adequate supply of such commodities, is not likely to increase the cost of the price support program, and will not adversely affect farm income, subject to the condition that payment under paragraph (4) or (6) with respect to diverted acreage devoted to any such crop shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable, taking <!-- PDFPage:668 -->into consideration the use of such acreage for the production of such crops, but in no event shall the payment exceed one-half the rate which otherwise would be applicable if such acreage were devoted to conservation uses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The acreage regarded as planted to cotton on any farm which qualifies for payment under this subsection except under paragraph (6) shall, for purposes of establishing future State, county, and farm acreage allotments and farm bases, be the farm acreage allotment established under section 1344 of this title, excluding adjustments under subsection (m)(2) thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) The Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers, including provision for sharing diversion payments on a fair and equitable basis under this subsection. The Secretary shall provide for the sharing of price support payments among producers on the farm on the basis of their respective shares in the cotton crop produced on the farm, or the proceeds therefrom, except that in any case in which the Secretary determines that such basis would not be fair and equitable, the Secretary shall provide for such sharing on such other basis as he may determine to be fair and equitable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) In any case in which the failure of a producer to comply fully with the terms and conditions of the programs formulated under this Act preclude the making of payments under this section, the Secretary may, nevertheless, make such payments in such amounts as he determines to be equitable in relation to the seriousness of the default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(12) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if, as a result of limitations hereafter enacted with respect to price support under this subsection, the Secretary is unable to make available to all cooperators the full amount of price support to which they would otherwise be entitled under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection for any crop of upland cotton, (A) price support to cooperators shall be made available for such crop (if marketing quotas have not been disapproved) through loans or purchases at such level not less than 65 per centum nor more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor as the Secretary determines appropriate; (B) in order to keep upland cotton to the maximum extent practicable in the normal channels of trade, such price support may be carried out through the simultaneous purchase of cotton at the support price therefor and resale at a lower price or through loans under which the cotton would be redeemable by payment of a price therefor lower than the amount of the loan thereon; and (C) such resale or redemption price shall be such as the Secretary determines will provide orderly marketing of cotton during the harvest season and will retain an adequate share of the world market for cotton produced in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(13) The provisions of section 590h(g) of title 16 (relating to assignment of payments), shall also apply to payments under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Price support, diversion, and cropland set-aside program for crops beginning with 1971 crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall upon presentation of warehouse receipts reflecting accrued storage charges of not more than 60 days make available for the 1971 through 1977 crops of upland cotton to cooperators nonrecourse loans for a term of ten months from the first day of the month in which the loan is made at such level as will reflect the Middling one-inch upland cotton (micronaire 3.5 through 4.9) at average location in the United States 90 per centum of the average price of American cotton in world markets for such cotton for the three-year period ending July 31 in the year in which the loan level is announced, except that if the loan rate so calculated is higher than the then current level of average world prices for American cotton of such quality, the Secretary is authorized to adjust the current calculated loan rate for cotton to 90 per centum of the then current average world price. The average world price for such cotton for such preceding three-year period shall be determined by the Secretary annually pursuant to a published regulation which shall specify the procedures and the factors to be used by the Secretary in making the world price determination. The loan level for any crop of upland cotton shall be determined and announced not later than November 1 of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which such loan is to be effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the carryover of upland cotton as of the beginning of the marketing year for any of the 1972 or 1973 crops exceeds 7.2 million bales, producers on any farm harvesting cotton of such crop from an acreage in excess of the base acreage allotment for such farm shall be entitled to loans and purchases only on an amount of the cotton of such crop produced on such farm determined by multiplying the yield used in computing payments for such farm by the base acreage allotment for such farm.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is less than the established price of 38 cents per pound in the case of the 1974 and 1975 crops, 38 cents per pound adjusted to reflect any change during the calendar year 1975 in the index of prices paid by farmers for production items, interest, taxes, and wage rates in the case of the 1976 crop, and the established price for the 1976 crop adjusted to reflect any change during the calendar year 1976 in such index in the case of the 1977 crop: <em>Provided,</em> That any increase that would otherwise be made in the established price to reflect a change in the index of prices paid by farmers shall be adjusted to reflect any change in (i) the national average yield per acre of cotton for the three calendar years preceding the year for which the determination is made, <!-- PDFPage:669 -->over (ii) the national average yield per acre of cotton for the three calendar years preceding the year previous to the one for which the determination is made. If the Secretary determines that the producers on a farm are prevented from planting any portion of the allotment to cotton because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or condition beyond the control of the producer, the rate of payment for such portion shall be the larger of (A) the foregoing rate, or (B) one-third of the established price. If the Secretary determines that, because of such a disaster or condition, the total quantity of cotton which the producers are able to harvest on any farm is less than 662/3 percent of the farm base acreage allotment times the average yield established for the farm, the rate of payment for the deficiency in production below 100 percent shall be the larger of (A) the foregoing rate, or (B) one-third of the established price. The payment rate with respect to any producer who (i) is on a small farm (that is, a farm on which the base acreage allotment is ten acres or less, or on which the yield used in making payments times the farm base acreage allotment is five thousand pounds or less, and for which the base acreage allotment has not been reduced under section 1350(f) of this title, (ii) resides on such farm, and (iii) derives his principal income from cotton produced on such farm, shall be increased by 30 per centum; but, notwithstanding paragraph (3), such increase shall be made only with respect to his share of cotton actually harvested on such farm within the quantity specified in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such payments shall be made available for a farm on the quantity of upland cotton determined by multiplying the acreage planted within the farm base acreage allotment for the farm for the crop by the average yield established for the farm: <em>Provided,</em> That payments shall be made on any farm planting not less than 90 per centum of the farm base acreage allotment on the basis of the entire amount of such allotment. For purposes of this paragraph, an acreage on the farm which the Secretary determines was not planted to cotton because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or a condition beyond the control of the producer shall be considered to be an acreage planted to cotton. The average yield for the farm for any year shall be determined on the basis of the actual yields per harvested acre for the three preceding years, except that the 1970 farm projected yield shall be substituted in lieu of the actual yields for the years 1968 and 1969: <em>Provided,</em> That the actual yields shall be adjusted by the Secretary for abnormal yields in any year caused by drought, flood, or other natural disaster: <em>Provided further,</em> That the average yield established for the farm for any year shall not be less than the yield used in making payments for the preceding year if the total cotton production on the farm in such preceding year is not less than the yield used in making payments for the farm for such preceding year times the farm base acreage allotment for such preceding year (for the 1970 crop, the farm domestic allotment).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary shall provide for a set aside of cropland if he determines that the total supply of agricultural commodities will, in the absence of such a set-aside, likely be excessive taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices and to meet a national emergency. If a set-aside of cropland is in effect under this paragraph (4), then as a condition of eligibility for loans and payments on upland cotton the producers on a farm must set aside and devote to approved conservation uses an acreage of cropland equal to (i) such percentage of the farm base acreage allotment for the farm as may be specified by the Secretary (not to exceed 28 per centum of the farm base acreage allotment), plus, if required by the Secretary, (ii) the acreage of cropland on the farm devoted in preceding years to soil conserving uses, as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary is authorized for the 1974 through 1977 crops to limit the acreage planted to upland cotton on the farm in excess of the farm base acreage allotment to a percentage of the farm base acreage allotment. The Secretary shall permit producers to plant and graze on set-aside acreage sweet sorghum, and the Secretary may permit, subject to such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, all or any of the set-aside acreage to be devoted to hay and grazing or the production of guar, sesame, safflower, castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, flaxseed, triticale, oats, rye, or other commodity, if he determines that such production is needed to provide an adequate supply, is not likely to increase the cost of the price-support program, and will not adversely affect farm income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) To assist in adjusting the acreage of commodities to desirable goals, the Secretary may make land diversion payments, in addition to the payments authorized in subsection (e)(2) of this section, to producers on a farm who, to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, devote to approved conservation uses an acreage of cropland on the farm in addition to that required to be so devoted under subsection (e)(4)(A) of this section. The land diversion payments for a farm shall be at such rate or rates as the Secretary determines to be fair and reasonable taking into consideration to the diversion undertaken by the producers and the productivity of the acreage diverted. The Secretary shall limit the total acreage to be diverted under agreements in any county or local community so as not to adversely affect the economy of the county or local community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The upland cotton program formulated under this section shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to protect the set-aside acreage and the additional diverted acreage from erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents. Such acreage may be devoted to wildlife food plots or wildlife habitat in conformity with standards established by the Secretary in consultation with wildlife agencies. The Secretary may in the case of programs for the 1974 through 1977 crops, pay an appropriate share of the cost of practices designed to carry out the purposes of the foregoing sentences. The Secretary may provide for an additional payment on such acreage in an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate in relation to the benefit to the general public if the producer agrees to permit, without other compensation, <!-- PDFPage:670 -->access to all or such portion of the farm as the Secretary may prescribe by the general public, for hunting, trapping, fishing, and hiking, subject to applicable State and Federal regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If the operator of the farm desires to participate in the program formulated under this section, he shall file his agreement to do so no later than such date as the Secretary may prescribe. Loans and purchases on upland cotton and payments under this section shall be made available to the producers on such farm only if producers set aside and devote to approved soil conserving uses an acreage on the farm equal to the number of acres which the operator agrees to set aside and devote to approved soil conserving uses, and the agreement shall so provide. The Secretary may, by mutual agreement with the producer, terminate or modify any such agreement entered into pursuant to this subsection (e)(6) if he determines such action necessary because of an emergency created by drought or other disaster or in order to alleviate a shortage in the supply of agricultural commodities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers, including provision for sharing on a fair and equitable basis, in payments under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In any case in which the failure of a producer to comply fully with the terms and conditions of the program formulated under this section precludes the making of loans, purchases, and payments, the Secretary may, nevertheless, make such loans, purchases, and payments in such amounts as he determines to be equitable in relation to the seriousness of the default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The Secretary is authorized to issue such regulations as he determines necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Program for extra long staple cotton beginning with 1984 crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this subsection, extra long staple cotton means cotton which is produced from pure strain varieties of the Barbadense species or any hybrid thereof, or other similar types of extra long staple cotton, designated by the Secretary, having characteristics needed for various end uses for which American upland cotton is not suitable and grown in irrigated cotton-growing regions of the United States designated by the Secretary or other areas designated by the Secretary is suitable for the production of such varieties or types and which is ginned on a roller-type gin or, if authorized by the Secretary, ginned on another type gin for experimental purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall, upon presentation of warehouse receipts reflecting accrued storage charges of not more than sixty days, make available to producers nonrecourse loans for a term of ten months from the first day of the month in which the loan is made at a level which is not less than 85 percent of the simple average price received by producers of extra long staple cotton, as determined by the Secretary, during 3 years of the 5-year period ending July 31 in the year in which the loan level is announced, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period..<sup><a href="#1444_1_target" name="1444_1">1</a></sup> If authorized by the Secretary, nonrecourse loans provided for in this subsection may, upon request of the producer during the tenth month of the loan period for the cotton, be made available for an additional term of eight months. The loan level for any crop of extra long staple cotton shall be determined and announced by the Secretary not later than December 1 of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which such loan is to be effective and such level shall not thereafter be changed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In addition, payments shall be made for each crop of extra long staple cotton to producers on each farm at a rate equal to the amount by which the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the average market price received by farmers for extra long staple cotton during the first eight months of the marketing year for such crop, as determined by the Secretary, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the loan level determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection for such crop,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is less than the established price per pound times, in each case, the farm program acreage for extra long staple cotton (determined in accordance with paragraph (5)(A), but in no event on a greater acreage than the acreage actually planted to extra long staple cotton for harvest), multiplied by the farm program payment yield for extra long staple cotton (determined in accordance with paragraph (4)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The established price for each crop of extra long staple cotton shall be 120 per centum of the loan level determined for such crop under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Secretary establishes an acreage limitation program for a crop of extra long staple cotton in accordance with paragraph (5)(A) and determines that deficiency payments will likely be made for such crop of extra long staple cotton under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary may make available advance deficiency payments for such crop to producers who agree to participate in the acreage limitation program. Such advance payments shall be made available to producers as soon as practicable after the producer files a notice of intention to participate in such acreage limitation program and in such amount as the Secretary determines appropriate to encourage adequate participation in such program, except that such amount shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying (i) the estimated farm program acreage for the crop, by (ii) the farm program payment yield for the crop, by (iii) 50 per centum of the projected payment rate, as determined by the Secretary. In any case in which the deficiency payment payable to a producer for a crop, as finally determined by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, is less than the amount paid to the <!-- PDFPage:671 -->producer as an advance deficiency payment under this paragraph, the producer shall refund an amount equal to the difference between the amount advanced and the amount finally determined by the Secretary to be payable to the producer. If the Secretary determines that no deficiency payments are due producers on a crop, the producer who received advanced payments on such crop shall refund such payments. If a producer fails to comply with the requirements under the acreage limitation program after obtaining an advance deficiency payment under this paragraph, the producer shall immediately repay the amount of the advance, plus interest thereon in such amount as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The farm program payment yield for each crop of extra long staple cotton shall be determined on the basis of the actual yields per harvested acre on the farm for the preceding three years, except that the actual yields shall be adjusted by the Secretary for abnormal yields in any year caused by drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers. In case farm yield data for one or more years are unavailable or there was no production, the Secretary shall provide for appraisals to be made on the basis of actual yields and program payment yields for similar farms in the area for which data are available. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph in the determination of yields, the Secretary shall take into account the actual yields proved by the producer, and neither such yields nor the farm program payment yield established on the basis of such yields shall be reduced under other provisions of this paragraph. If the Secretary determines it necessary, the Secretary may establish national, State, or county program payment yields on the basis of historical yields, as adjusted by the Secretary to correct for abnormal factors affecting such yields in the historical period, or, if such data are not available, on the Secretary's estimate of actual yields for the crop year involved. If national, State, or county program payment yields are established, the farm program payment yields shall balance to the national, State, or county program payment yields.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the Secretary may establish a limitation on the acreage planted to extra long staple cotton if the Secretary determines that the total supply of extra long staple cotton, in the absence of such limitation, will be excessive taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable prices and to meet a national emergency. Such limitation shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (including a zero percentage reduction) to the acreage base for each extra long staple cotton-producing farm. Producers who knowingly produce extra long staple cotton in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm shall be ineligible for extra long staple cotton loans and payments with respect to that farm. The acreage base for any farm for the purpose of determining any reduction required to be made for any year as a result of a limitation under this subparagraph shall be the average acreage planted on the farm to extra long staple cotton for harvest in the three crop years immediately preceding the year prior to the year for which the determination is made. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, acreage planted to extra long staple cotton for harvest shall include any acreage which the producers were prevented from planting to extra long staple cotton or other nonconserving crops in lieu of extra long staple cotton because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster or other condition beyond the control of the producers. The Secretary may make adjustments to reflect established crop-rotation practices and to reflect such other factors as the Secretary determines should be considered in determining a fair and equitable base. There is hereby established for the 1984, 1985, and 1986 crops an acreage base reserve equal to 5 per centum of the total of the farm acreage bases established for the crop under the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph. Such reserve shall be in addition to the total of the farm acreage bases and shall be used by the county committees, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, for making adjustments of farm acreage bases to correct inequities and prevent hardship, and for establishing bases for farms on which no extra long staple cotton was planted during the preceding four years. A number of acres on the farm determined by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying the number of acres required to be withdrawn from the production of extra long staple cotton times the number of acres actually planted to such commodity, by (ii) the number of acres authorized to be planted to such commodity under the limitation established by the Secretary, shall be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, which will assure protection of such acreage from weeds and wind and water erosion. The number of acres so determined is hereafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;reduced acreage&rdquo;. The Secretary may permit, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of the reduced acreage to be devoted to sweet sorghum, hay and grazing, or the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, crambe, plantago ovato, flaxseed, triticale, rye, or other commodity, if the Secretary determines that such production is needed to provide an adequate supply of such commodities, is not likely to increase the cost of the price support program, and will not affect farm income adversely. The individual farm program acreage shall be the actual acreage planted on the farm to extra long staple cotton for harvest within the permitted extra long staple cotton acreage for the farm as established under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Secretary shall ensure, under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary, that the total of the crop acreage bases established on a farm which is enrolled in a production adjustment program for any commodity shall not be increased as a result of the application of the provisions set forth in paragraph (13)(C), as extended for the 1989 and 1990 crop.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may make land diversion payments to producers of extra long staple cot<!-- PDFPage:672 -->ton, whether or not an acreage limitation program for extra long staple cotton is in effect, if the Secretary determines that such land diversion payments are necessary to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of extra long staple cotton to desirable goals. Such land diversion payments shall be made to producers who, to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, devote to approved conservation uses an acreage of cropland on the farm in accordance with land diversion contracts entered into by the Secretary with such producers. The amounts payable to producers under land diversion contracts may be determined through the submission of bids for such contracts by producers in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe or through such other means as the Secretary determines appropriate. In determining the acceptability of contract offers, the Secretary shall take into consideration the extent of the diversion to be undertaken by the producers and the productivity of the acreage diverted. The Secretary shall limit the total acreage to be diverted under agreements in any county or local community so as not to affect adversely the economy of the county or local community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The reduced acreage and the diverted acreage may be devoted to wildlife food plots or wildlife habitat in conformity with standards established by the Secretary in consultation with wildlife agencies. The Secretary may pay an appropriate share of the cost of practices designed to carry out the purpose of the foregoing sentence. The Secretary may provide for an additional payment on such acreage in an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate in relation to the benefit to the general public if the producer agrees to permit, without other compensation, access to all or such portion of the farm, as the Secretary may prescribe, by the general public, for hunting, trapping, fishing, and hiking, subject to applicable State and Federal regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) An operator of a farm desiring to participate in the program conducted under paragraph (5) shall execute an agreement with the Secretary providing for such participation not later than such date as the Secretary may prescribe. The Secretary may, by mutual agreement with the producers on the farm, terminate or modify any such agreement if the Secretary determines such action necessary because of an emergency created by drought or other disaster or to prevent or alleviate a shortage in the supply of agricultural commodities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall provide for the sharing of payments made under this subsection for any farm among the producers on the farm on a fair and equitable basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) If the failure of a producer to comply fully with the terms and conditions of the program formulated under this subsection precludes the making of loans and payments, the Secretary may, nevertheless, make such loans and payments in such amounts as the Secretary determines to be equitable in relation to the seriousness of the failure. The Secretary may authorize the county and State committees established under section 590h(b) of title 16 to waive or modify deadlines and other program requirements in cases in which lateness or failure to meet such other requirements does not affect adversely the operation of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) The Secretary may issue such regulations as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) The Secretary shall carry out the program authorized by this subsection through the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(12) The provisions of section 590h(g) of title 16 (relating to assignment of payments) shall apply to payments made under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(13)(A) Compliance on a farm with the terms and conditions of any other commodity program or compliance with crop acreage base requirements for any other commodity may not be required as a condition of eligibility for loans or payments under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may not require producers on a farm, as a condition of eligibility for loans or payments under this section for the farm, to comply with the terms and conditions of the extra long staple cotton program with respect to any other farm operated by the producers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(14) In order to encourage and assist producers in the orderly ginning and marketing of their extra long staple cotton production, the Secretary shall make recourse loans available to such producers on seed cotton in accordance with authority vested in the Secretary under the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act [15 U.S.C. 714 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(15) References made in sections 1422, 1423, 1426, 1427, and 1431 of this title to the terms &ldquo;support price&rdquo;, &ldquo;level of support&rdquo;, and &ldquo;level of price support&rdquo; shall be considered to apply as well to the level of loans for extra long staple cotton under this subsection; and references to the terms &ldquo;price support&rdquo;, &ldquo;price support operations&rdquo;, and &ldquo;price support program&rdquo; in such sections and in section 1421(a) of this title shall be considered as applying as well to the loan operations for extra long staple cotton under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this subsection shall not be applicable to the 1996 and subsequent crops of extra long staple cotton.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary shall, on presentation of warehouse receipts or other acceptable evidence of title, as determined by the Secretary, reflecting accrued storage charges of not more than 60 days, make available for the 1991 through 1997 crops of upland cotton to producers on a farm nonrecourse loans for upland cotton produced on the farm for a term of 10 months from the first day of the month in which the loan is made at such loan level, per pound, as will reflect for the base quality of upland cotton, as determined by the Secretary, at average location in the United States a level that is not less than the smaller of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 85 percent of the average price (weighted by market and month) of the base quality of cotton as quoted in the designated United States spot markets during 3 years of the 5-year period ending July 31 in the year in which the loan level is announced, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in the period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 90 percent of the average, for the 15-week period beginning July 1 of the year in which the loan level is announced, of the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-seconds inch cotton C.I.F. Northern Europe (adjusted downward by the average difference during the period April 15 through October 15 of the year in which the loan is announced between the average Northern European price quotation of such quality of cotton and the market quotations in the designated United States spot markets for the base quality of upland cotton), as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments to loan level</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limitation on decrease in loan level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The loan level for any crop determined under paragraph (1) may not be reduced by more than 5 percent from the level determined for the preceding crop, and may not be reduced below 50 cents per pound.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation on increase in loan level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for any crop the average Northern European price determined under paragraph (1)(B) is less than the average United States spot market price determined under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary may increase the loan level to such level as the Secretary may consider appropriate, not in excess of the average United States spot market price determined under paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Announcement of loan level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan level for any crop of upland cotton shall be determined and announced by the Secretary not later than November 1 of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which the loan is to be effective or, in the case of the 1991 crop, as soon as is practicable after November 28, 1990. The loan level shall not thereafter be changed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Extension of loan period</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), nonrecourse loans provided for in this section shall, on request of the producer during the 10th month of the loan period for the cotton, be made available for an additional term of 8 months.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A request to extend the loan period shall not be approved in any month in which the average price of the base quality of upland cotton, as determined by the Secretary, in the designated spot markets for the preceding month exceeded 130 percent of the average price of such base quality of cotton in the designated United States spot markets for the preceding 36-month period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Marketing loan provisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines that the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location) is below the loan level determined under the foregoing provisions of this subsection, in order to make United States upland cotton competitive in world markets, the Secretary shall permit a producer to repay a loan made for any crop at&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a level that is the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the loan level determined for the crop; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) the loan level determined for the crop multiplied by 70 percent; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:677 --><p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such other level (not in excess of the loan level determined for the crop nor less than 70 percent of such loan level) that the Secretary determines will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) minimize potential loan forfeitures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) minimize the accumulation of cotton stocks by the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing cotton; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) allow cotton produced in the United States to be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) First handler marketing certificates</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">During the period beginning August 1, 1991, and ending July 31, 1998, if a program carried out under subparagraph (A) or subsection (b) of this section fails to make United States upland cotton fully competitive in world markets and the prevailing world market price of upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary, is below the current loan repayment rate for upland cotton determined under subparagraph (A), to make United States upland cotton competitive in world markets and to maintain and expand domestic consumption and exports of upland cotton produced in the United States, the Secretary shall provide for the issuance of marketing certificates or cash payments in accordance with this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commodity Credit Corporation, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, shall make payments, through the issuance of marketing certificates or cash payments, to first handlers of cotton (persons regularly engaged in buying or selling upland cotton) who have entered into an agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation to participate in the program established under this subparagraph. The payments shall be made in such monetary amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines will make upland cotton produced in the United States available at competitive prices, consistent with the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The value of each certificate or cash payment issued under clause (ii) shall be based on the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the loan repayment rate for upland cotton; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the prevailing world market price of upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Redemption, marketing, or exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commodity Credit Corporation, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, may assist any person receiving marketing certificates under this subparagraph in the redemption of certificates for cash, or marketing or exchange of the certificates for agricultural commodities or products owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation, at such times, in such manner, and at such price levels as the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the program established under this subparagraph. Any price restrictions that may otherwise apply to the disposition of agricultural commodities by the Commodity Credit Corporation shall not apply to the redemption of certificates under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Designation of commodities and products; charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Insofar as practicable, the Secretary shall permit owners of certificates to designate the commodities and the products thereof, including storage sites thereof, the owners would prefer to receive in exchange for certificates. If any certificate is not presented for redemption, marketing, or exchange within a reasonable number of days after the issuance of the certificate (as determined by the Secretary), reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges, as determined by the Secretary, shall be deducted from the value of the certificate for the period beginning after the reasonable number of days and ending with the date of the presentation of the certificate to the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Displacement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall take such measures as may be necessary to prevent the marketing or exchange of agricultural commodities and products for certificates under this subsection from adversely affecting the income of producers of the commodities or products.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, certificates issued to cotton handlers under this subparagraph may be transferred to other handlers and persons approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prevailing world market price</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a formula to define the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a mechanism by which the Secretary shall announce periodically the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location) established under <!-- PDFPage:678 -->this subparagraph shall be used under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (E).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Adjustment of prevailing world market price</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">During the period beginning August 1, 1991, and ending July 31, 1998, the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location) established under subparagraph (C) shall be further adjusted if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the adjusted prevailing world market price is less than 115 percent of the current crop year loan level for the base quality of upland cotton, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the Friday through Thursday average price quotation for the lowest-priced United States growth as quoted for Middling (M) one and three-thirty seconds inch cotton delivered C.I.F. Northern Europe is greater than the Friday through Thursday average price of the five lowest-priced growths of upland cotton, as quoted for Middling (M) one and three-thirty seconds inch cotton, delivered C.I.F. Northern Europe (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;Northern Europe price&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Further adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clause (iii), the adjusted prevailing world market price shall be further adjusted on the basis of some or all of the following data, as available:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The value of the marketing certificates or cash payments shall be based on the amount of the difference (reduced by 1.25 cents per pound) in such prices during the 4th week of the consecutive 4-week period multiplied by the quantity of upland cotton included in the documented sales.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Administration</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Referendum of 1958 corn producers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than December 15, 1958, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of producers of corn in 1958 in the commercial corn-producing area for 1958 to determine whether such producers favor a price support program as provided in subsection (b) of this section for the 1959 and subsequent crops in lieu of acreage allotments as provided in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.], and price support as provided in section 1441 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Operative status of certain provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if less than a majority of the producers voting in the referendum conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section favor a price support program as provided in this subsection (b), the following provisions of law shall become inoperative:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) [Section enacted section 1329a of this title.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) [Section enacted section 1444b of this title.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) [Section repealed section 1441(d)(4) of this title.]</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cotton research program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture is hereby authorized and directed to conduct a special cotton research program designed to reduce the cost of producing upland cotton in the United States at the earliest practicable date. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums, not to exceed $10,000,000 annually, as may be necessary for the Secretary to carry out this special research program. The Secretary shall report annually to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate with respect to the results of such research.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cotton insect eradication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to reduce cotton production costs, to prevent the movement of certain cotton plant insects to areas not now infested, and to enhance the quality of the environment, the Secretary is authorized and directed to carry out programs to destroy and eliminate cotton boll weevils in infested areas of the United States as provided herein and to carry out similar programs with respect to pink bollworms or any other major cotton insect if the Secretary determines that methods and systems have been developed to the point that success in eradication of such insects is assured. The Secretary shall carry out the eradication programs authorized by this subsection through the Commodity Credit Corporation. In carrying out insect eradication projects, the Secretary shall utilize the technical and related services of appropriate Federal, State, private agencies, and cotton organizations. Producers and landowners in an eradication zone, established by the Secretary, who are receiving benefits from any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, shall, as a condition of receiving or continuing any such benefits, participate in and cooperate with the eradication project, as specified in regulations of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may issue such regulations as he deems necessary to enforce the provisions of this subsection with respect to achieving the <!-- PDFPage:689 -->compliance of producers and landowners who are not receiving benefits from any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture. Any person who knowingly violates any such regulation promulgated by the Secretary under this subsection may be assessed a civil penalty of not to exceed $5,000 for each offense. No civil penalty shall be assessed unless the person shall have been given notice and opportunity for a hearing on such charge in the county, parish, or incorporated city of the residence of the person charged. In determining the amount of the penalty the Secretary shall consider the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, the effect on the person's ability to continue in business, and the gravity of the violation. Where special measures deemed essential to achievement of the eradication objective are taken by the project and result in a loss of production and income to the producer, the Secretary shall provide reasonable and equitable indemnification from funds available for the project and also provide for appropriate protection of the allotment, acreage history, and average yield for the farm. The cost of the program in each eradication zone shall be determined, and cotton producers in the zone shall be required to pay up to one-half thereof, with the exact share in each zone area to be specified by the Secretary upon his finding that such share is reasonable and equitable based on population levels of the target insect and the degree of control measures normally required. Each producer's pro rata share shall be deducted from his cotton payment under this Act or otherwise collected, as provided in regulations of the Secretary. Insofar as practicable, cotton producers and other persons engaged in cotton production in the eradication zone shall be employed to participate in the work of the project in such zone. Funding of the program shall be terminated at such time as the Secretary determines and reports to the Congress that complete eradication of the insects for which programs are undertaken pursuant to this subsection has been accomplished. Funds in custody of agencies carrying out the program shall, upon termination of such program, be accounted for to the Secretary for appropriate disposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to cooperate with the Government of Mexico in carrying out operations or measures in Mexico which he deems necessary and feasible to prevent the movement into the United States from Mexico of any insects eradicated under the provisions of this subsection. The measure and character of cooperation carried out under this subsection on the part of the United States and on the part of the Government of Mexico, including the expenditure or use of funds made available by the Secretary under this subsection, shall be such as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Arrangements for the cooperations authorized by this subsection shall be made through and in consultation with the Secretary of State. The Commodity Credit Corporation shall not make any expenditures for carrying out the purposes of this subsection unless the Corporation has received funds to cover such expenditures from appropriations made to carry out the purposes of this subsection. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Commodity Credit Corporation such sums as the Congress may from time to time determine to be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans and purchases</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary shall make available to producers on a farm loans and purchases for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of corn produced on the farm at such level as the Secretary determines will encourage the exportation of feed grains and not result in excessive total stocks of feed grains after taking into consideration the cost of producing corn, supply and demand conditions, and world prices for corn.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum loan and purchase level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), the loan and purchase level determined under paragraph (1) shall not be less than 85 percent of the simple average price received by producers of corn, as determined by the Secretary, during the marketing years for the immediately preceding 5 crops of corn, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period, except that the loan and purchase level for a crop determined under this paragraph may not be reduced by more than 5 percent from the level determined for the preceding crop.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustments to support level</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Stocks to use ratio</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary estimates for any marketing year that the ratio of ending stocks of corn to total use for the marketing year will be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) equal to or greater than 25 percent, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for corn for the corresponding crop by an amount not to exceed 10 percent in any year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) less than 25 percent but not less than 12.5 percent, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for corn for the corresponding crop by an amount not to exceed 5 percent in any year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) less than 12.5 percent the Secretary may not reduce the loan and purchase level for corn for the corresponding crop.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Report to Congress</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the Secretary adjusts the level of loans and purchases for corn under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) certifying such adjustment as necessary to prevent the accumulation of stocks and to retain market share; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) containing a description of the need for such adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Effective date of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The adjustment shall become effective no earlier than 60 calendar days after the <!-- PDFPage:696 -->date of submission of the report to the Committees, except that in the case of the 1991 crop of feed grains, the adjustment shall become effective on the date of the submission of the report.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Competitive position</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the Secretary determines, not later than 60 days prior to the beginning of a marketing year for a crop, that the effective loan rate established for such crop will not maintain a competitive market position for corn, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for corn for the marketing year by an amount, in addition to any reduction under subparagraph (A), not to exceed 10 percent in any year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) No effect on future years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any reduction in the loan and purchase level for corn under this paragraph shall not be considered in determining the loan and purchase level for corn for subsequent years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Minimum loan rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the loan rate for corn shall not be less than $1.76 per bushel, unless such rate would exceed 80 percent of the 5-year average market price determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Marketing loan provisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may permit a producer to repay a loan made under this subsection for a crop at a level (except as provided in subparagraph (C)) that is the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the loan level determined for the crop;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 70 percent of such level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if the loan level for a crop was reduced under paragraph (3), 70 percent of the loan level that would have been in effect but for the reduction under paragraph (3); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the prevailing world market price for feed grains (adjusted to United States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Prevailing world market price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary permits a producer to repay a loan in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a formula to determine the prevailing world market price for feed grains, adjusted to United States quality and location; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a mechanism by which the Secretary shall announce periodically the prevailing world market price for feed grains.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Alternative repayment rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of feed grains, if the world market price for feed grains (adjusted to United States quality and location) as determined by the Secretary, is less than the loan level determined for the crop, the Secretary may permit a producer to repay a loan made under this subsection for a crop at such level (not in excess of the loan level determined for the crop) as the Secretary determines will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) minimize potential loan forfeitures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) minimize the accumulation of feed grain stocks by the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing feed grains; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) allow feed grains produced in the United States to be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Simple average price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the simple average price received by producers for the immediately preceding marketing year shall be based on the latest information available to the Secretary at the time of the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Other feed grains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make available to producers loans and purchases for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of grain sorghums, barley, oats, and rye, respectively, produced on the farm at such level as the Secretary determines is fair and reasonable in relation to the level that loans and purchases are made available for corn, taking into consideration the feeding value of the commodity in relation to corn and other factors specified in section 1421(b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A payment under this subsection shall be computed by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the loan payment rate; by</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Loan payment rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the loan payment rate shall be the amount by which&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any of the provisions of section 1441 of this title: (a) For the 1960 crop of any kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect, or for which marketing quotas are not disapproved by producers, the support level in cents per pound shall be the level at which the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco was supported, or if marketing quotas were disapproved for the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco, the level at which the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco would have been supported if marketing quotas had been in effect. (b) For the 1961 crop and each <!-- PDFPage:708 -->subsequent crop of any kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect, or for which marketing quotas are not disapproved by producers, the support level in cents per pound shall be determined by adjusting the support level for the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco, or if marketing quotas were disapproved for the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco, the level at which the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco would have been supported if marketing quotas had been in effect, by multiplying such support level for the 1959 crop by the ratio of (i) the average of the index of prices paid by farmers, including wage rates, interest, and taxes, as defined in section 1301(a)(1)(C) of this title, for the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the marketing year begins for the crop for which the support level is being determined to (ii) the average index of such prices paid by farmers, including wage rates, interest, and taxes for the calendar year 1959.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If acreage poundage or poundage farm marketing quotas are in effect under section 1314c or 1314e of this title, (1) price support shall not be made available on tobacco marketed in excess of 103 per centum of the marketing quota (after adjustments) for the farm on which such tobacco was produced, and (2) for the purpose of price-support eligibility, tobacco carried over from one marketing year to another shall, when marketed, be considered tobacco of the then current crop.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1423 of this title, if the Secretary determines that the supply of any grade of any kind of tobacco of a crop for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers will likely be excessive, the Secretary, after prior consultation with the association through which price support for the grade and kind of tobacco is made available to producers, may reduce the support rate which would otherwise be established for such grade of tobacco after taking into consideration the effect such reduction may have on the supply and price of other grades of other kinds of quota tobacco: <em>Provided,</em> That the weighted average of the support rates for all eligible grades of such kind of tobacco shall, after such reduction, reflect not less than (1) 65 per centum of the increase in the support level for such kind of tobacco which would otherwise be established under this section, if the support level therefor is higher then the support level for the preceding crop, or (2) the support level for such kind of tobacco established under this section, if the support level therefor is not higher than the support level for the preceding crop. In determining whether the supply of any grade of any kind of tobacco of a crop will be excessive, the Secretary shall take into consideration the domestic supply, including domestic inventories, the amount of such tobacco pledged as security for price support loans, and anticipated domestic and export demand, based on the maturity, uniformity and stalk position of such tobacco.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Omitted</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) For the 1984 crop of Flue-cured tobacco, the support level shall be the level in cents per pound at which the 1982 crop was supported.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For the 1985 crop of Flue-cured tobacco, the support level shall be the level in cents per pound at which the 1982 crop was supported, plus or minus, respectively, the amount by which (A) the support level for the 1985 crop, as determined under subsection (b) of this section, is greater or less than (B) the support level for the 1984 crop, as determined under subsection (b) of this section, as that difference may be adjusted by the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section if the support level under clause (A) is greater than the support level under clause (B), except that the support level for the 1985 crop shall be the level in cents per pound at which the 1982 crop was supported if the support level as determined under subsection (b) of this section for the 1985 crop would not be more than 5 per centum greater than the support level as determined under subsection (b) of this section for the 1984 crop.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) For the 1984 crop of any kind of tobacco (other than Flue-cured tobacco) for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers and for the 1985 crop of any kind of tobacco (other than Flue-cured and Burley tobacco) for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers, the Secretary shall establish the support level at such level as will not narrow the normal price support differential between Flue-cured tobacco and such other kind of tobacco. Before establishing the support level under this paragraph for any such kind of tobacco the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the level the Secretary proposes to establish and give an opportunity for the public to comment on the proposal. In determining the level to be established under this paragraph for a particular kind of tobacco, the Secretary shall take into consideration the cost of producing such kind of tobacco, the supply and demand conditions for such kind of tobacco, the comments received in response to the public notice of the proposal, and such other relevant factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) For the 1985 and 1986 crops of Burley tobacco, the support level shall be $1.488 per pound.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) For the 1986 crop of Flue-cured tobacco, the support level shall be $1.438 per pound.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), for the 1986 and each subsequent crop of any kind of tobacco (other than Flue-cured and Burley tobacco) for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers, the support level shall be the level in cents per pound at which the immediately preceding crop was supported, plus or minus, respectively, the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the support level for the crop for which the determination is being made, as determined under subsection (b) of this section; is greater or less than</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the support level for the immediately preceding crop, as determined under subsection (b) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:709 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as that difference may be adjusted by the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section if the support level under clause (i) is greater than the support level under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and subsection (d) of this section, if requested by the board of directors of an association through which price support for the respective kind of tobacco specified in subparagraph (A) is made available to producers, the Secretary may reduce the support level for such kind of tobacco to the extent requested by the association to more accurately reflect the market value and improve the marketability of such tobacco.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7)(A) For the 1987 and each subsequent crop of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect or are not disapproved by producers, the support level shall be the level in cents per pound at which the immediately preceding crop was supported, plus or minus, respectively, an adjustment of not less than 65 percent nor more than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary after taking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved in relation to demand, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 66.7 percent of the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the average price received by producers for Flue-cured and Burley tobacco, respectively, on the United States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period, is greater or less than</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the average price received by producers for Flue-cured and Burley tobacco, respectively, on the United States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior to the marketing year for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco, in the index of prices paid by tobacco producers from January 1 to December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determination is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the average market price for Burley tobacco for the 1985 marketing year shall be reduced by $0.039 per pound;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the average market price for Burley tobacco for the 1984 and each prior applicable marketing year shall be reduced by $0.30 per pound;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Effective only for each of the 1994 through 1998 crops of tobacco for which price support is made available under this Act, each producer and purchaser of such tobacco, and each importer of the same kind of tobacco, shall remit to the Commodity Credit Corporation a nonrefundable marketing assessment in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the maintenance of a viable tobacco price support and production adjustment program is in the interests of tobacco producers, purchasers of tobacco, persons employed directly or indirectly by the tobacco industry, and the localities and States whose <!-- PDFPage:711 -->economies and tax bases are dependent on the tobacco industry;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the present tobacco price support program is in jeopardy and in need of reform;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) under present law, the levels of price support for tobacco have resulted in market prices for tobacco that are not competitive on the world market;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) as a consequence, extremely large quantities of domestic tobacco have been put under loan and placed in the inventories of the producer-owned cooperative marketing associations that administer the tobacco price support program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the increased inventories have led to a significant increase in the assessments producers are required to pay to maintain the tobacco price support program on a &lsquo;no net cost&rsquo; basis;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) such increasingly large assessments are creating a severe hardship on producers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the existence of such large inventories poses a threat to the orderly marketing of future crops of tobacco;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) will minimize any losses to the Federal Government; and</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to restore the tobacco price support program to a stable condition; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) continue to make price support available to producers through such association in accordance with loan agreements entered into between the Corporation and such association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish and maintain in accordance with this section a No Net Cost Tobacco Account for such association in lieu of the No Net Cost Tobacco Fund established within such association under section 1445&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of No Net Cost Tobacco Account within Commodity Credit Corporation; disposition of amounts in No Net Cost Tobacco Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any Account established for an association under subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be established within the Corporation and shall be comprised of amounts paid by producers, purchasers, and importers under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the establishment of an Account for an association, any amount in the No Net Cost Tobacco Fund established within such association under section 1445&ndash;1 of this title shall be applied or disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may approve or prescribe, except that such amount shall, to the extent necessary, first be applied or used for the purposes therefor prescribed in such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of assessments to Corporation for deposit into Account; determination and adjustment of amounts; collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) If an Account is established for an association under subsection (b)(2) of this section, then the Secretary shall require (in lieu of any requirement under section 1445&ndash;1(d)(1) of this title) that each producer of the kind of tobacco involved whose farm is within such association's area shall, as a condition of eligibility for price support, agree, with respect to all of such kind of tobacco marketed by the producer from the farm, to pay to the Corporation, for deposit in such association's Account, marketing assessments as determined under paragraph (2) and collected under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall also require (in lieu of any requirement under section 1445&ndash;1(d)(1) of this title) that each purchaser of Flue-cured and Burley quota tobacco shall pay to the Corporation, for deposit in the Account of such association, an assessment, as determined under paragraph (2) and collected under paragraph (3), with respect to purchases of all such kind of tobacco marketed by a producer from a farm (including purchases of such tobacco from the 1986 and subsequent crops from the association).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall also require (in lieu of any requirement under section 1445&ndash;1(d)(1) of this title) that each importer of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco shall pay to the Corporation, for deposit in the Account of the association, an assessment, as determined under paragraph (2) and collected under paragraph (3), with respect to <!-- PDFPage:716 -->purchases of all such kinds of tobacco imported by the importer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine and adjust from time to time, in consultation with such association, the amount of the marketing assessment which shall be imposed, as a condition of eligibility for price support, on each pound of the kind of tobacco involved marketed by a producer from a farm within such association's area and the amount of the assessment to be paid by purchasers of tobacco. The amount of the assessment to be paid by producers and purchasers shall be determined in such a manner that producers and purchasers share equally, to the maximum extent practicable, in maintaining the Account of an association. In making such determination with respect to the assessment of a purchaser, only 1985 and subsequent crops of Flue-cured and Burley quota tobacco shall be taken into account. The amount of the assessment shall be equal to an amount which, when collected, will result in an accumulation of an Account for such association adequate to reimburse the Corporation for any net losses which the Corporation may sustain under its loan agreements with such association, based on reasonable estimates of the amounts which the Corporation will lend to such association under such agreements and the proceeds which will be realized from the sales of the kind of tobacco involved which are pledged to the Corporation by such association as security for loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the amount of any assessment that is determined by the Secretary for the 1986 and subsequent crops of Burley quota tobacco shall be determined without regard to any net losses that the Corporation may sustain under the loan agreements of the Corporation with such association with respect to the 1983 crop of such tobacco.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If tobacco of the kind for which an Account is established is marketed by a producer through a warehouseman or agent, both the producer and the purchaser assessment shall be collected from such warehouseman or agent, who may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) deduct an amount equal to the producer assessment from the price paid to the producer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) add an amount equal to the purchaser assessment to the price paid by the purchaser.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If tobacco of the kind for which an Account is established is marketed by a producer directly to any person outside the United States, both the producer and the purchaser assessment shall be collected from the producer, who may add an amount equal to the purchaser assessment to the price paid by the purchaser.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If Flue-cured or Burley tobacco is imported by an importer, any importer assessment required by subsection (d) of this section shall be collected from the importer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposits into Account; insurance against net losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts deposited in an Account established for an association shall be used by the Secretary for the purpose of ensuring, insofar as practicable, that the Corporation under its loan agreements with such association will suffer, with respect to the crop involved, no net losses (including, but not limited to, recovery of the amount of loans extended to cover the overhead costs of the association), after any net gains are applied to net losses of the Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Suspension of payment and collection of marketing assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide, in any loan agreement between the Corporation and an association for which an Account has been established under subsection (b)(2) of this section, that if the Secretary determines that the amount in such Account or the net gains referred to in subsection (h) of this section exceed the amounts necessary for the purposes of this section, then the Secretary, in consultation with such association, may suspend the payment and collection of marketing assessments under this section upon terms and conditions established by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disposition of amounts in Account in the event of termination of loan agreement or account or dissolution or merger of association</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any association for which an Account is established under subsection (b)(2) of this section, if a loan agreement between the Corporation and such association is terminated, if such association is dissolved or merges with another association that has entered into a loan agreement with the Corporation to make price support available to producers of the kind of tobacco involved, or if such Account terminates by operation of law, then amounts in such Account and the net gains referred to in subsection (h) of this section shall be applied to or disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe, except that they shall, to the extent necessary, first be applied to or used for the purposes therefor prescribed in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Net gains</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Failure to collect assessment; marketing penalty; civil action for review of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Each person who fails to collect any assessment as required by subsection (d)(3) of this section and remit such assessment to the Corporation, at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, shall be liable, in addition to any amount due, to a marketing penalty at a rate equal to 75 percent of the average market price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for the kind of tobacco involved for the immediately preceding year on the quantity of tobacco as to which the failure occurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each importer who fails to pay to the Corporation an assessment as required by subsection (d) of this section at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, shall be liable, in addition to any amount due, to a marketing penalty at a rate equal to 75 percent of the average market price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for the respective kind of tobacco for the immediately preceding year on the quantity of tobacco as to which the failure occurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may reduce any such marketing penalty in such amount as the Secretary determines equitable in any case in which the Secretary determines that the failure was unintentional or without knowledge on the part of the person concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Any penalty provided for under this paragraph shall be assessed by the Secretary after notice and opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this subsection may obtain review of such penalty in an appropriate district court of the United States by filing a civil action in such court not later than 30 days after such penalty is imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record on which the penalty is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review and enforce any penalty imposed under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1441 of this title, beginning with the 1964 crop&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Price support for wheat accompanied by domestic certificates shall be at such level not less than 65 per centum or more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration the factors specified in section 1421(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Price support for wheat accompanied by export certificates shall be at such level not more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration the factors specified in section 1421(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Price support for wheat not accompanied by marketing certificates shall be at such level, not in excess of 90 per centum of the parity price therefor, as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration competitive world prices of wheat, the feeding value of wheat in relation to feed grains, and the level at which price support is made available for feed grains.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Price support shall be made available only to cooperators: and, if a commercial wheat-producing area is established for such crop, price support shall be made available only in the commercial wheat-producing area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Effective with respect to crops planted for harvest in the calendar year 1966 and any subsequent year, the level of price support for any crop of wheat for which a national marketing quota is not proclaimed or for which marketing quotas have been disapproved by producers shall be as provided in section 1441 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A &ldquo;cooperator&rdquo; with respect to any crop of wheat produced on a farm shall be a producer who (i) does not knowingly exceed (A) the farm acreage allotment for wheat on the farm or (B) except as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, the farm acreage allotment for wheat on any other farm on which the producer shares in the production of wheat, and (ii) complies with the land-use requirements of section 1339 of this title, to the extent prescribed by the Secretary. Effective with respect to crops planted for harvest in the calendar year 1966 and any subsequent year, if marketing quotas are not in effect for the crop of wheat, a &ldquo;cooperator&rdquo; with respect to any crop of wheat produced on a farm shall be a producer who does not knowingly exceed the farm acreage allotment for wheat. No producer shall be deemed to have exceeded a farm acreage allotment for wheat if the entire amount of the farm marketing excess is delivered to the Secretary or stored in accordance with applicable regulations to avoid or postpone payment of the penalty, but the producer shall not be eligible to receive price support on such marketing excess. No producer shall be deemed to have exceeded the farm acreage allotment for wheat on any other farm, if such farm is exempt from the farm marketing quota for such crop under section 1335 of this title. No producer shall be deemed to have exceeded a farm acreage allotment for wheat if the production on the acreage in excess of the farm acreage allotment is stored pursuant to the provisions of section 1379c(b) of this title, but the producer shall not be eligible to receive price support on the wheat so stored.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans and purchases</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary shall make available to producers on a farm loans and purchases for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of wheat produced on the farm at such level as the Secretary determines will maintain the competitive relationship of wheat to other grains in domestic and export markets after taking into consideration the cost of producing wheat, supply and demand conditions, and world prices for wheat.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum loan and purchase level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), the loan and purchase level determined under paragraph (1) shall not be less than 85 percent of the simple average price received by producers of wheat, as determined by the Secretary, during the marketing years for the immediately preceding 5 crops of wheat, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period, except that the loan and purchase level for a crop determined under this paragraph may not be reduced by more than 5 percent from the level determined for the preceding crop.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustments to support level</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Stocks to use ratio</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary estimates for any marketing year that the ratio of ending stocks of wheat to total use for the marketing year will be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) equal to or greater than 30 percent, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop by an amount not to exceed 10 percent in any year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) less than 30 percent but not less than 15 percent, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop by an amount not to exceed 5 percent in any year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) less than 15 percent, the Secretary may not reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Report to Congress</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the Secretary adjusts the level of loans and purchases for wheat under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) certifying such adjustment as necessary to prevent the accumulation of stocks and to retain market share; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) containing a description of the need for such adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Effective date of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The adjustment shall become effective no earlier than 60 calendar days after the date of submission of the report to the Committees, except that in the case of the 1991 crop of wheat, the adjustment shall become effective on the date of the submission of the report.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Competitive position</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the Secretary determines, not later than 60 days prior to the beginning of a marketing year for a crop, that the effective loan rate established for such crop will not maintain a competitive market position for wheat, the Secretary may reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the marketing year by an amount, in addition to any reduction under subparagraph (A), not to exceed 10 percent in any year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) No effect on future years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any reduction in the loan and purchase level for wheat under this paragraph shall not be considered in determining the loan and purchase level for wheat for subsequent years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Minimum loan rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the loan rate for wheat shall not be less than $2.44 per bushel, unless such rate would exceed 80 percent of the 5-year average market price determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Marketing loan provisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may permit a producer to repay a loan made under this subsection for a crop at a level (except as provided in subparagraph (C)) that is the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the loan level determined for the crop;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 70 percent of such level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if the loan level for a crop was reduced under paragraph (3), 70 percent of the loan level that would have been in effect but for the reduction under paragraph (3); or</p>
