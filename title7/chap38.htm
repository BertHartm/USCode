<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a sound, efficient, and privately operated system for distributing and marketing agricultural products is essential to a prosperous agriculture and is indispensable <!-- PDFPage:826 -->to the maintenance of full employment and to the welfare, prosperity, and health of the Nation. It is further declared to be the policy of Congress to promote through research, study, experimentation, and through cooperation among Federal and State agencies, farm organizations, and private industry a scientific approach to the problems of marketing, transportation, and distribution of agricultural products similar to the scientific methods which have been utilized so successfully during the past eighty-four years in connection with the production of agricultural products so that such products capable of being produced in abundance may be marketed in an orderly manner and efficiently distributed. In order to attain these objectives, it is the intent of Congress to provide for (1) continuous research to improve the marketing, handling, storage, processing, transportation, and distribution of agricultural products; (2) cooperation among Federal and State agencies, producers, industry organizations, and others in the development and effectuation of research and marketing programs to improve the distribution processes; (3) an integrated administration of all laws enacted by Congress to aid the distribution of agricultural products through research, market aids and services, and regulatory activities, to the end that marketing methods and facilities may be improved, that distribution costs may be reduced and the price spread between the producer and consumer may be narrowed, that dietary and nutritional standards may be improved, that new and wider markets for American agricultural products may be developed, both in the United States and in other countries, with a view to making it possible for the full production of American farms to be disposed of usefully, economically, profitably, and in an orderly manner. In effectuating the purposes of this chapter, maximum use shall be made of existing research facilities owned or controlled by the Federal Government or by State agricultural experiment stations and of the facilities of the Federal and State extension services. To the maximum extent practicable marketing research work done under this chapter in cooperation with the States shall be done in cooperation with the State agricultural experiment stations; marketing educational and demonstrational work done under this chapter in cooperation with the States shall be done in cooperation with the State agricultural extension service; market information, inspection, regulatory work and other marketing service done under this chapter in cooperation with the State agencies shall be done in cooperation with the State departments of agriculture, and State bureaus and departments of markets.</p>

The Secretary of Agriculture shall have authority to enter into contracts and agreements under the terms of regulations promulgated by him with States and agencies of States, private firms, institutions, and individuals for the purpose of conducting research and service work, making and compiling reports and surveys, and carrying out other functions relating thereto when in his judgment the services or functions to be performed will be carried out more effectively, more rapidly, or at less cost than if performed by the Department of Agriculture. Contracts under this section may be made for work to be performed within a period not more than four years from the date of any such contract, and advance, progress, or other payments may be made. The provisions of section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31 and section 5 of title 41 shall not be applicable to contracts or agreements made under the authority of this section.

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) for an increasing number of people in the United States, these are times of great suffering and deprivation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) rising unemployment, decreasing appropriations for social services, and increasingly adverse economic conditions have all contributed to produce hunger and want on a scale not experienced since the time of the Great Depression;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the demand for every conceivable form of assistance for the hungry and needy people of the United States grows more critical daily, while the availability of goods and services to meet the needs of such people is rapidly diminishing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) soup kitchens, food banks, and other organizations which provide food to the hungry report an astronomical increase in the number of persons seeking the assistance of such organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) according to a study completed by the General Accounting Office in 1977, one hundred and thirty-seven million tons of food, or more than 20 per centum of this country's total annual food production, is wasted or discarded in the United States each year;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) at wholesale and retail food distributors, shipping terminals, and other establishments all across the country, enormous quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables and dated dairy and bakery products are discarded each day, while growing numbers of Americans go to bed hungry and undernourished each night;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) in these times of budget constraints and appeals for reductions in Federal spending, the use of private resources to meet the basic food requirements of our citizens should be encouraged; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) many States and local governments have not enacted laws which limit the liability of food donors, such as so-called Good Samaritan Acts and donor liability laws, and thus have discouraged donation of food to the needy by private persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) departments and agencies of the Federal Government should take such steps as may be necessary to distribute to hungry people of the United States surplus food or food which would otherwise be discarded;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) State and local governments which have not yet enacted so-called Good Samaritan or donor liability laws to encourage private cooperative efforts to provide food for hungry people within their respective jurisdictions should do so as quickly as possible; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) wholesale and retail food distributors, shipping terminals, and other establishments should work more closely with religious, community, and other charitable organizations to make wholesome food which is currently being wasted or discarded by such establishments available for immediate distribution to hungry people of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) certain State laws permit a secured lender to enforce liens against a purchaser of farm products even if the purchaser does not know that the sale of the products violates the lender's security interest in the products, lacks any practical method for discovering the existence of the security interest, and has no reasonable means to ensure that the seller uses the sales proceeds to repay the lender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) these laws subject the purchaser of farm products to double payment for the products, once at the time of purchase, and again when the seller fails to repay the lender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the exposure of purchasers of farm products to double payment inhibits free competition in the market for farm products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) this exposure constitutes a burden on and an obstruction to interstate commerce in farm products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declaration of purpose</h4>
