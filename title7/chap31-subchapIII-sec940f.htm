<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Feasibility and security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Extensions under this section shall not be made unless the Secretary first finds and certifies that, after giving effect to the extension, in his judgment the security for all loans to the borrower made or guaranteed under this chapter is reasonably adequate and that all such loans will be repaid within the time agreed.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount eligible for extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Extensions under this section shall not be granted if the principal balance extended exceeds the appraised value of the generating plant or transmission line referred to in subsection paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Period of extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Extensions under this section shall in no case result in a final maturity greater than 55 years from the time of original disbursement and shall in no case result in a final maturity greater than the useful life of the plant.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment</h4>
