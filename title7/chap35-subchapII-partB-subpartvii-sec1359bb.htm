<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consistent with the administration of marketing allotments for each of the 2002 through <!-- PDFPage:628 -->2007 crop years, the marketing allotments shall not apply to sugar sold&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to enable another processor to fulfill an allocation established for that processor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for uses other than domestic human consumption, except for the sale of sugar for the production of ethanol or other bioenergy if the disposition of the sugar is administered by the Secretary under section 8110 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to facilitate the exportation of the sugar.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any processor who knowingly violates paragraph (1) shall be liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty in an amount equal to 3 times the United States market value, at the time of the commission of the violation, of that quantity of sugar involved in the violation.</p>
