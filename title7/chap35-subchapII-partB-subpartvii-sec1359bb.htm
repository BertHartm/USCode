<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the quantity of sugars, syrups, and molasses that will be imported for human consumption or to be used for the extraction of sugar for human consumption in the United States during the crop year, whether such articles are under a tariff-rate quota or are in excess or outside of a tariff-rate quota.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may include sugar products, whose majority content is sucrose for human consumption, derived from sugarcane, sugar beets, molasses, or sugar in the allotments under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines it to be appropriate for purposes of this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During any crop year or portion thereof for which marketing allotments have been established, no processor of sugar beets or sugarcane shall market a quantity of sugar in excess of the allocation established for such processor, except to enable another processor to fulfill an allocation established for such other processor or to facilitate the exportation of such sugar.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any processor who knowingly violates paragraph (1) shall be liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty in an amount equal to 3 times the United States market value, at the time of the commission of the violation, of that quantity of sugar involved in the violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definition of market</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subpart, the term &ldquo;market&rdquo; shall mean to sell or otherwise dispose of in commerce in the United States (including the forfeiture of sugar under the loan program for sugar under section 7272 of this title and, with respect to any integrated processor and refiner, the movement of raw cane sugar into the refining process).</p>
