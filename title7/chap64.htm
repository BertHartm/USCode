<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct, through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, a pilot research program to link major cancer and heart and other circulatory disease research efforts with agricultural research efforts to identify compounds in vegetables and fruits that prevent these diseases. Using information derived from such combined research efforts, the Secretary shall assist in the development of new varieties of vegetables and fruits having enhanced therapeutic properties for disease prevention.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program through agreements entered into with land-grant colleges or universities, other universities, State agricultural experiment stations, the State cooperative extension services, nonprofit organizations with demonstrable expertise, or Federal or State governmental entities.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Formulation of system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall formulate and submit to Congress, within ninety days after September 29, 1977, a proposal for a comprehensive nutritional status monitoring system, to include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an assessment system consisting of periodic surveys and continuous monitoring to determine: the extent of risk of nutrition-related health problems in the United States; which population groups or areas of the country face greatest risk; and the likely causes of risk and changes in the above risk factors over time;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1337 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a surveillance system to identify remediable nutrition-related health risks to individuals or for local areas, in such a manner as to tie detection to direct intervention and treatment. Such system should draw on screening and other information from other health programs, including those funded under titles V, XVIII, and XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 701 et seq., 1395 et seq., and 1396 et seq.] and section 330 of the Public Health Service Act;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3178_1_target" name="3178_1">1</a></sup> and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) program evaluations to determine the adequacy, efficiency, effectiveness, and side effects of nutrition-related programs in reducing health risks to individuals and populations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coordination of existing activities; recommendation for necessary additional authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The proposal shall provide for coordination of activities under existing authorities and contain recommendations for any additional authorities necessary to achieve a comprehensive monitoring system.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote the general welfare through the improved health and productivity of domestic livestock, poultry, aquatic animals, and other income-producing animals that are essential to the food supply of the United States and the welfare of producers and consumers of animal products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve the health of horses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) facilitate the effective treatment of, and, to the extent possible, prevent animal and poultry diseases in both domesticated and wild animals that, if not controlled, would be disastrous to the United States livestock and poultry industries and endanger the food supply of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) improve methods for the control of organisms and residues in food products of animal origin that could endanger the human food supply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) improve the housing and management of animals to improve the well-being of livestock production species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) minimize livestock and poultry losses due to transportation and handling;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) protect human health through control of animal diseases transmissible to humans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) improve methods of controlling the births of predators and other animals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) otherwise promote the general welfare through expanded programs of research and extension to improve animal health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total animal health and disease research and extension efforts of State colleges and universities and of the Federal Government would be more effective if there were close coordination between the efforts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) colleges and universities having accredited schools or colleges of veterinary medicine and State agricultural experiment stations that conduct animal health and disease research are especially vital in training research workers in animal health and related disciplines.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such funds as Congress may determine necessary to support research on specific national or regional animal health or disease problems, or national or regional problems relating to pre-harvest, on-farm food safety, or animal well-being, but not to exceed $35,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1991 through 2007, and not in excess of such sums as may after September 29, 1977, be authorized by law for any subsequent fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Duration of grants</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of annual priority lists for allocation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to establish a rational allocation of funds appropriated under this section, the Secretary shall establish annually priority lists of animal health and disease, food safety, and animal well-being problems of national or regional significance. Such lists shall be prepared after consultation with the Advisory Board. Any recommendations made in connection with such consultation shall not be controlling on the Secretary's determination of priorities. In establishing such priorities, the Secretary and the Advisory Board shall consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any health or disease problem which causes or may cause significant economic losses to any part of the livestock production industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any food safety problem that has a significant pre-harvest (on-farm) component and is recognized as posing a significant health hazard to the consuming public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) issues of animal well-being related to production methods that will improve the housing and management of animals to improve the well-being of livestock production species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether current scientific knowledge necessary to prevent, cure, or abate such a health or disease problem is adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whether the status of scientific research is such that accomplishments may be anticipated through the application of scientific effort to such health or disease problem.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment of priorities for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Without regard to any consultation under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall, to the extent feasible, award grants on the basis of the priorities assigned through a peer review system. Grantees shall be selected on a competitive basis in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary may establish.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distribution of multiyear grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of multiyear grants, the Secretary shall distribute funds to grant recipients on a schedule which is reasonably related to the timetable required for the orderly conduct of the research project involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Applicability of Federal Advisory Committee Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) and title XVIII of this Act [7 U.S.C. 2281 et seq.] shall not apply to a panel or board created solely for the purpose of reviewing applications or proposals submitted under this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the general welfare through improved productivity of the Nation's rangelands, which comprise 60 per centum of the land area of the United States. Most of these rangelands are unsuited for cultivation, but produce a great volume of forage that is inedible by humans but readily converted, through an energy efficient process, to high quality food protein by grazing animals. These native grazing lands are located throughout the United States and are important resources for major segments of the Nation's livestock industry. In addition to the many livestock producers directly dependent on rangelands, other segments of agriculture are indirectly dependent on range-fed livestock and on range-produced forage that can be substituted for grain in times of grain scarcity. Recent resource assessments indicate that forage produc<!-- PDFPage:1367 -->tion of rangeland can be increased at least 100 per centum through development and application of improved range management practices while simultaneously enhancing wildlife, watershed, recreational, and aesthetic values and reducing hazards of erosion and flooding.</p>

The program shall include studies of: (1) management of rangelands and agricultural land as integrated systems for more efficient utilization of crops and waste products in the production of food and fiber; (2) methods of managing rangeland watersheds to maximize efficient use of water and improve water yield, water quality, and water conservation, to protect against onsite and offsite damage of rangeland resources from floods, erosion, and other detrimental influences, and to remedy unsatisfactory and unstable rangeland conditions; (3) revegetation and rehabilitation of rangelands including the control of undesirable species of plants; and (4) such other matters as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
