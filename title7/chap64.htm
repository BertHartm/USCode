<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Although medical researchers in recent years have demonstrated that there are several naturally occurring compounds in many vegetables and fruits that can aid in the prevention of certain forms of cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and atherosclerosis, there has been almost no research conducted to enhance these compounds in food plants by modern breeding and molecular genetic methods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) By linking the appropriate medical and agricultural research scientists in a highly-focused, targeted research program, it should be possible to develop new varieties of vegetables and fruits that would provide greater prevention of diet-related diseases that are a major cause of death in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Pilot research program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct, through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Exten<!-- PDFPage:1216 -->sion Service, a pilot research program to link major cancer and heart and other circulatory disease research efforts with agricultural research efforts to identify compounds in vegetables and fruits that prevent these diseases. Using information derived from such combined research efforts, the Secretary shall assist in the development of new varieties of vegetables and fruits having enhanced therapeutic properties for disease prevention.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program through agreements entered into with land-grant colleges or universities, other universities, State agricultural experiment stations, the State cooperative extension services, nonprofit organizations with demonstrable expertise, or Federal or State governmental entities. The Secretary shall enter into the agreements on a competitive basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1997 to carry out the pilot program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 10 per centum shall be distributed equally among all States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the remainder shall be allocated to each State in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this subparagraph as the population of the State living at or below 125 per centum of the income poverty guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (adjusted pursuant to section 9902(2) of title 42), bears to the total population of all the States living at or below 125 per centum of the income poverty guidelines, as determined by the last preceding decennial census at the time each such additional amount is first appropriated. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not preclude the Secretary from developing educational materials and programs for persons in income ranges above the level designated in this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the expanded food and nutrition education program established under section 343(d) of this title and this section, $83,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1996 and 1997.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall formulate and submit to Congress, within ninety days after September 29, 1977, a proposal for a comprehensive nutritional status monitoring system, to include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an assessment system consisting of periodic surveys and continuous monitoring to determine: the extent of risk of nutrition-related health problems in the United States; which population groups or areas of the country face greatest risk; and the likely causes of risk and changes in the above risk factors over time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a surveillance system to identify remediable nutrition-related health risks to individuals or for local areas, in such a manner as to tie detection to direct intervention and treatment. Such system should draw on screening and other information from other health programs, including those funded under titles V, XVIII, and XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 701 et seq., 1395 et seq., and 1396 et seq.] and section 330 of the Public Health Service Act;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3178_1_target" name="3178_1">1</a></sup> and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) program evaluations to determine the adequacy, efficiency, effectiveness, and side effects of nutrition-related programs in reducing health risks to individuals and populations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coordination of existing activities; recommendation for necessary additional authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The proposal shall provide for coordination of activities under existing authorities and contain recommendations for any additional authorities necessary to achieve a comprehensive monitoring system.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote the general welfare through the improved health and productivity of domestic livestock, poultry, aquatic animals, and other income-producing animals that are essential to the food supply of the United States and the welfare of producers and consumers of animal products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve the health of horses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) facilitate the effective treatment of, and, to the extent possible, prevent animal and poultry diseases in both domesticated and wild animals that, if not controlled, would be disastrous to the United States livestock and poultry industries and endanger the food supply of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) improve methods for the control of organisms and residues in food products of animal origin that could endanger the human food supply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) improve the housing and management of animals to improve the well-being of livestock production species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) minimize livestock and poultry losses due to transportation and handling;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) protect human health through control of animal diseases transmissible to humans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) improve methods of controlling the births of predators and other animals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) otherwise promote the general welfare through expanded programs of research and extension to improve animal health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total animal health and disease research and extension efforts of State colleges and universities and of the Federal Government would be more effective if there were close coordination between the efforts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) colleges and universities having accredited schools or colleges of veterinary medicine and State agricultural experiment stations that conduct animal health and disease research are especially vital in training research workers in animal health and related disciplines.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of annual priority lists for allocation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to establish a rational allocation of funds appropriated under this section, the Secretary shall establish annually priority lists of animal health and disease, food safety, and animal well-being problems of national or regional significance. Such lists shall be prepared after <!-- PDFPage:1222 -->consultation with the Advisory Board and the Board. Any recommendations made in connection with such consultation shall not be controlling on the Secretary's determination of priorities. In establishing such priorities, the Secretary, the Advisory Board, and the Board shall consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any health or disease problem which causes or may cause significant economic losses to any part of the livestock production industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any food safety problem that has a significant pre-harvest (on-farm) component and is recognized as posing a significant health hazard to the consuming public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) issues of animal well-being related to production methods that will improve the housing and management of animals to improve the well-being of livestock production species;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether current scientific knowledge necessary to prevent, cure, or abate such a health or disease problem is adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whether the status of scientific research is such that accomplishments may be anticipated through the application of scientific effort to such health or disease problem.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment of priorities for grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Without regard to any consultation under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall, to the extent feasible, award grants on the basis of the priorities assigned through a peer review system.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the general welfare through improved productivity of the Nation's rangelands, which comprise 60 per centum of the land area of the United States. Most of these rangelands are unsuited for cultivation, but produce a great volume of forage that is inedible by humans but readily converted, through an energy efficient process, to high quality food protein by grazing animals. These native grazing lands are located throughout the United States and are important resources for major segments of the Nation's livestock industry. In addition to the many livestock producers directly dependent on rangelands, other segments of agriculture are indirectly dependent on range-fed livestock and on range-produced forage that can be substituted for grain in times of grain scarcity. Recent resource assessments indicate that forage production of rangeland can be increased at least 100 per centum through development and application of improved range management practices while simultaneously enhancing wildlife, watershed, recreational, and aesthetic values and reducing hazards of erosion and flooding.</p>
