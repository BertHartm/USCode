<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) subchapter V of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is in the national public interest and vital to the welfare of the agricultural economy of the United States to maintain and expand existing markets and develop new markets and uses for agricultural commodities through industry-funded, Government-supervised, generic commodity promotion programs established under commodity promotion laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) These generic commodity promotion programs, funded by the agricultural producers or processors who most directly reap the benefits of the programs and supervised by the Secretary of Agriculture, provide a unique opportunity for producers and processors to inform consumers about their products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The central congressional purpose underlying each commodity promotion law has always been to maintain and expand markets for the agricultural commodity covered by the law, rather than to maintain or expand the share of those markets held by any individual producer or processor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The commodity promotion laws were neither designed nor intended to prohibit or restrict, and the promotion programs established and funded pursuant to these laws do not prohibit or restrict, individual advertising or promotion of the covered commodities by any producer, processor, or group of producers or processors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) It has never been the intent of Congress for the generic commodity promotion programs established and funded by the commodity promotion laws to replace the individual advertising and promotion efforts of producers or processors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) An individual producer's or processor's own advertising initiatives are typically designed to increase the share of the market held by that producer or processor rather than to increase or expand the overall size of the market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In contrast, a generic commodity promotion program is intended and designed to maintain or increase the overall demand for the agricultural commodity covered by the program and increase the size of the market for that commodity, often by utilizing promotion methods and techniques that individual producers and processors typically are unable, or have no incentive, to employ.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The commodity promotion laws establish promotion programs that operate as &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; mechanisms for producers and processors to fund generic promotions for covered commodities which, under the required supervision and oversight of the Secretary of Agriculture&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) further specific national governmental goals, as established by Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) produce nonideological and commercial communication the purpose of which is to further the governmental policy and objective of maintaining and expanding the markets for the covered commodities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) While some commodity promotion laws grant a producer or processor the option of crediting individual advertising conducted by the producer or processor for all or a portion of the producer's or processor's marketing promotion assessments, all promotion programs established under the commodity promotion laws, both those programs that permit credit for individual advertising and those programs that do not contain such provisions, are very narrowly tailored to fulfill the congressional purposes of the commodity promotion laws without impairing or infringing the legal or constitutional rights of any individual producer or processor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) These generic commodity promotion programs are of particular benefit to small producers who often lack the resources or market power to advertise on their own and who are otherwise often unable to benefit from the economies of scale available in promotion and advertising.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Periodic independent evaluation of the effectiveness of these generic commodity promotion programs will assist Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture in ensuring that the objectives of the programs are met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Independent evaluation of promotion program effectiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided by law, each commodity board established under the supervision and oversight of the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to a commodity promotion law shall, not less often than every 5 years, authorize and fund, from funds otherwise available to the board, an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the generic commodity promotion programs and other programs conducted by the board pursuant to a commodity promotion law. The board shall submit to the Secretary, and make available to the public, the results of each periodic independent evaluation conducted under this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1609 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall annually provide to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate information on administrative expenses on programs established under commodity promotion laws.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The production of agricultural commodities plays a significant role in the economy of the United States. Thousands of producers in the United States are involved in the production of agricultural commodities, and such commodities are consumed by millions of people throughout the United States and foreign countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Agricultural commodities must be of high quality, readily available, handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that consumers have an adequate supply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The maintenance and expansion of existing markets and the development of new markets for agricultural commodities through generic commodity promotion, research, and in<!-- PDFPage:1610 -->formation programs are vital to the welfare of persons engaged in the production, marketing, and consumption of such commodities, as well as to the general economy of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Generic promotion, research, and information activities for agricultural commodities play a unique role in advancing the demand for such commodities, since such activities increase the total market for a product to the benefit of consumers and all producers. These generic activities complement branded advertising initiatives, which are aimed at increasing the market share of individual competitors, and are of particular benefit to small producers who lack the resources or market power to advertise on their own. These generic activities do not impede the branded advertising efforts of individual firms, but instead increase general market demand for an agricultural commodity using methods that individual companies do not have the incentive to employ.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Generic promotion, research, and information activities for agricultural commodities, paid by the producers and others in the industry who reap the benefits of such activities, provide a unique opportunity for producers to inform consumers about a particular agricultural commodity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) It is important to ensure that generic promotion, research, and information activities for agricultural commodities be carried out in an effective and coordinated manner designed to strengthen the position of the commodities in the marketplace and to maintain and expand their markets and uses. Independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the generic promotion activities of these programs will assist the Secretary of Agriculture and Congress in ensuring that these objectives are met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The cooperative development, financing, and implementation of a coordinated national program of research, promotion, and information regarding agricultural commodities are necessary to maintain and expand existing markets and to develop new markets for these commodities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Agricultural commodities move in interstate and foreign commerce, and agricultural commodities and their products that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce in agricultural commodities and their products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Commodity promotion programs have the ability to provide significant conservation benefits to producers and the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to authorize the establishment, through the exercise by the Secretary of Agriculture of the authority provided in this subchapter, of an orderly program for developing, financing, and carrying out an effective, continuous, and coordinated program of generic promotion, research, and information regarding agricultural commodities designed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) strengthen the position of agricultural commodity industries in the marketplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) maintain and expand existing domestic and foreign markets and uses for agricultural commodities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) develop new markets and uses for agricultural commodities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) assist producers in meeting their conservation objectives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter provides for the control of production or otherwise limits the right of any person to produce, handle, or import an agricultural commodity.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1636 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) popcorn is an important food that is a valuable part of the human diet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the production and processing of popcorn plays a significant role in the economy of the United States in that popcorn is processed by several popcorn processors, distributed through wholesale and retail outlets, and consumed by millions of people throughout the United States and foreign countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) popcorn must be of high quality, readily available, handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that the benefits of popcorn are available to the people of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and uses and the development of new markets and uses for popcorn are vital to the welfare of processors and persons concerned with marketing, using, and producing popcorn for the market, as well as to the agricultural economy of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the cooperative development, financing, and implementation of a coordinated program of popcorn promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information is necessary to maintain and expand markets for popcorn; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) popcorn moves in interstate and foreign commerce, and popcorn that does not move in those channels of commerce directly burdens or affects interstate commerce in popcorn.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of Congress that it is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided in this subchapter, of an orderly procedure for developing, financing (through adequate assessments on unpopped popcorn processed domestically), and carrying out an effective, continuous, and coordinated program of promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information designed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) strengthen the position of the popcorn industry in the marketplace; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for popcorn.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintain and expand the markets for all popcorn products in a manner that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is not designed to maintain or expand any individual share of a producer or processor of the market;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not compete with or replace individual advertising or promotion efforts designed to promote individual brand name or trade name popcorn products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) authorizes and funds programs that result in government speech promoting government objectives; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish a nationally coordinated program for popcorn promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Statutory construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This subchapter treats processors equitably. Nothing in this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides for the imposition of a trade barrier to the entry into the United States of imported popcorn for the domestic market; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides for the control of production or otherwise limits the right of any individual processor to produce popcorn.</p>
