<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Finding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that certain States and local communities of the region, including local development districts, may be unable to take maximum advantage of Federal grant programs for which the States and communities are eligible because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) they lack the economic resources to meet the required matching share; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there are insufficient funds available under the applicable Federal grant law authorizing the program to meet pressing needs of the region.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Federal grant program funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the Federal cochairperson may use amounts made available to carry out this subchapter, without regard to any limitations on areas eligible for assistance or authorizations for appropriation under any other Act, to fund all or any portion of the basic Federal contribution to a project or activity under a Federal grant program in the region in an amount that is above the fixed maximum portion of the cost of the project otherwise authorized by applicable law, but not to exceed 90 percent of the costs of the project (except as provided in section 2009aa&ndash;5(b) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any program or project for which all or any portion of the basic Federal <!-- PDFPage:1016 -->contribution to the project under a Federal grant program is proposed to be made under this section, no Federal contribution shall be made until the Federal official administering the Federal law authorizing the contribution certifies that the program or project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) meets the applicable requirements of the applicable Federal grant law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) could be approved for Federal contribution under the law if funds were available under the law for the program or project.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification by Authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The certifications and determinations required to be made by the Authority for approval of projects under this subchapter in accordance with section 2009aa&ndash;8 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be controlling; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be accepted by the Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Acceptance by Federal cochairperson</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any finding, report, certification, or documentation required to be submitted to the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government responsible for the administration of any Federal grant program shall be accepted by the Federal cochairperson with respect to a supplemental grant for any project under the program.</p>
