<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Income and other financial resources as substantial limiting factors in obtaining more nutritious diet; recipients under Social Security Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Participation in the food stamp program shall be limited to those households whose incomes and other financial resources, held singly or in joint ownership, are determined to be a substantial limiting factor in permitting them to obtain a more nutritious diet. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter except sections 2015(b), 2015(d)(2), and 2015(g) of this title and the third sentence of section 2012(i) of this title, households in which each member receives benefits under a State plan approved under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], supplemental security income benefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.], or aid to the aged, blind, or disabled under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq., 1201 et seq., 1351 et seq., or 1381 et seq.], shall be eligible to participate in the food stamp program. Except for sections 2015, 2025(e)(1), and the third sentence of section 2012(i) of this title, households in which each member receives benefits under a State or local general assistance program that complies with standards established by the Secretary for ensuring that the program is based on income criteria comparable to or more restrictive than those under subsection (c)(2) of this section, and not limited to one-time emergency payments that cannot be provided for more than one consecutive month, shall be eligible to participate in the food stamp program. Assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households who make application for such participation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniform national standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish uniform national standards of eligibility (other than the income standards for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States established in accordance with subsections (c) and (e) of this section) for participation by households in the food stamp program in accordance with the provisions of this section. No plan of operation submitted by a State agency shall be approved unless the standards of eligibility meet those established by the Secretary, and no State agency shall impose any other standards of eligibility as a condition for participating in the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Gross income standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The income standards of eligibility shall be adjusted each October 1 and shall provide that a household shall be ineligible to participate in the food stamp program if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the household's income (after the exclusions and deductions provided for in subsections (d) and (e) of this section) exceeds the poverty line, as defined in section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)), for the forty-eight contiguous States and the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and Guam, respectively; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a household that does not include an elderly or disabled member, the household's income (after the exclusions provided for in subsection (d) of this section but before the deductions provided for in subsection (e) of this section) exceeds such poverty line by more than 30 per centum.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In no event shall the standards of eligibility for the Virgin Islands of the United States or Guam exceed those in the forty-eight contiguous States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Income excluded in computing household income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Household income for purposes of the food stamp program shall include all income from whatever source excluding only (1) any gain or benefit which is not in the form of money payable directly to a household (notwithstanding its conversion in whole or in part to direct payments to households pursuant to any demonstration project carried out or authorized under Federal law including demonstration projects created by the waiver of provisions of Federal law), (2) any income in the certification period which is received too infrequently or irregularly to be reasonably anticipated, but not in excess of $30 in a quarter, subject to modification by the Secretary in light of subsection (f) of this section, (3) all educational loans on which payment is deferred, grants, scholarships, fellowships, veterans&rsquo; educational benefits, and the like (A) awarded to a household member enrolled at a recognized institution of post-secondary education, at a school for the handicapped, in a vocational education program, or in a program that provides for completion of a secondary school diploma or obtaining the equivalent thereof, (B) to the extent that they do not exceed the amount used for or made available as an allowance determined by such school, institution, program, or other grantor, for tuition and mandatory fees (including the rental or purchase of any equipment, materials, and supplies related to the pursuit of the course of study involved), books, supplies, transportation, and other miscellaneous personal expenses (other than living expenses), of the student incidental to attending such school, institution, or program, and (C) to the extent loans include any origination fees and insurance premiums, (4) all loans other than educational loans on which repayment is deferred, (5) reimbursements which do not exceed expenses actually incurred and which do not represent a gain or benefit to the household and any allowance a State agency provides no more frequently than annually to families with children on the occasion of those children's entering or returning to school or child care for the purpose of obtaining school clothes (except that no such allowance shall be excluded if the State agency reduces monthly assistance to families with dependent children under part A of title IV of the Social Security <!-- PDFPage:1049 -->Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) in the month for which the allowance is provided): <em>Provided,</em> That no portion of benefits provided under title IV&ndash;A of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], to the extent it is attributable to an adjustment for work-related or child care expenses (except for payments or reimbursements for such expenses made under an employment, education, or training program initiated under such title after September 19, 1988), and no portion of any educational loan on which payment is deferred, grant, scholarship, fellowship, veterans&rsquo; benefits, and the like that are provided for living expenses, shall be considered such reimbursement, (6) moneys received and used for the care and maintenance of a third-party beneficiary who is not a household member, (7) income earned by a child who is a member of the household, who is an elementary or secondary school student, and who is 21 years of age or younger, (8) moneys received in the form of nonrecurring lump-sum payments, including, but not limited to, income tax refunds, rebates, or credits, cash donations based on need that are received from one or more private nonprofit charitable organizations, but not in excess of $300 in the aggregate in a quarter, retroactive lump-sum social security or railroad retirement pension payments and retroactive lump-sum insurance settlements: <em>Provided,</em> That such payments shall be counted as resources, unless specifically excluded by other laws, (9) the cost of producing self-employed income, but household income that otherwise is included under this subsection shall be reduced by the extent that the cost of producing self-employment income exceeds the income derived from self-employment as a farmer, (10) any income that any other Federal law specifically excludes from consideration as income for purposes of determining eligibility for the food stamp program except as otherwise provided in subsection (k) of this section, (11) any payments or allowances made for the purpose of providing energy assistance (A) under any Federal law, or (B) under any State or local laws, designated by the State or local legislative body authorizing such payments or allowances as energy assistance, and determined by the Secretary to be calculated as if provided by the State or local government involved on a seasonal basis for an aggregate period not to exceed six months in any year even if such payments or allowances (including tax credits) are not provided on a seasonal basis because it would be administratively infeasible or impracticable to do so, (12) through September 30 of any fiscal year, any increase in income attributable to a cost-of-living adjustment made on or after July 1 of such fiscal year under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq., 1381 et seq.], section 3(a)(1) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. 231b(a)(1)), or section 5312 of title 38, if the household was certified as eligible to participate in the food stamp program or received an allotment in the month immediately preceding the first month in which the adjustment was effective, (13) at the option of a State agency and subject to subsection (m) of this section, child support payments that are excluded under section 402(a)(8)(A)(vi) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 602(a)(8)(A)(vi)), (14) any payment made to the household under section 3507 of title 26 (relating to advance payment of earned income credit), (15) any payment made to the household under section 2015(d)(4)(I) of this title for work related expenses or for dependent care, and (16) any amounts necessary for the fulfillment of a plan for achieving self-support of a household member as provided under subparagraph (A)(iii) or (B)(iv) of section 1612(b)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1382a(b)(4)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deductions in computing household income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing household income for purposes of determining eligibility and benefit levels for households containing an elderly or disabled member and determining benefit levels only for all other households, the Secretary shall allow a standard deduction of $85 a month for each household, except that households in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States shall be allowed a standard deduction of $145, $120, $170, and $75, respectively. Such standard deductions shall be adjusted (1) on October 1, 1983, to the nearest lower dollar increment to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for items other than food and the homeowners&rsquo; costs and maintenance and repair component of shelter costs, as appropriately adjusted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics after consultation with the Secretary, for the fifteen months ending the preceding March 31, (2) on October 1, 1984, to the nearest lower dollar increment to reflect such changes for the fifteen months ending the preceding June 30, (3) on October 1, 1985, and October 1, 1986, to the nearest lower dollar increment to reflect such changes for the twelve months ending the preceding June 30, and (4) on October 1, 1987, and each October 1 thereafter, to the nearest lower dollar increment to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for items other than food, for the twelve months ending the preceding June 30. All households with earned income shall be allowed an additional deduction of 20 per centum of all earned income (other than that excluded by subsection (d) of this section), to compensate for taxes, other mandatory deductions from salary, and work expenses, except that such additional deduction shall not be allowed with respect to earned income that a household willfully or fraudulently fails (as proven in a proceeding provided for in section 2015(b) of this title) to report in a timely manner. Households, other than those households containing an elderly or disabled member, shall also be entitled, with respect to expenses other than expenses paid on behalf of the household by a third party, amounts made available and excluded for the expenses under subsection (d)(3) of this section, and expenses that are paid under section 2015(d)(4)(I) of this title for dependent care, to (1) a dependent care deduction, the maximum allowable level of which shall be $200 a month for each dependent child under 2 years of age and $175 a month for each other dependent, for the actual cost of payments necessary for the care of a dependent when such care enables a household member to accept or continue employment, <!-- PDFPage:1050 -->or training or education which is preparatory for employment and (2) an excess shelter expense deduction to the extent that the monthly amount expended by a household for shelter exceeds an amount equal to 50 per centum of monthly household income after all other applicable deductions have been allowed. In the 15-month period ending September 30, 1995, such excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $231 a month in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, and shall not exceed, in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, $402, $330, $280, and $171 a month, respectively. In the 15-month period ending December 31, 1996, such excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $247 a month in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, and shall not exceed, in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, $429, $353, $300, and $182 a month, respectively. In computing the excess shelter expense deduction, a State agency may use a standard utility allowance in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, except that a State agency may use an allowance which does not fluctuate within a year to reflect seasonal variations. An allowance for a heating or cooling expense may not be used for a household that does not incur a heating or cooling expense, as the case may be, or does incur a heating or cooling expense but is located in a public housing unit which has central utility meters and charges households, with regard to such expense, only for excess utility costs. No such allowance may be used for a household that shares such expense with, and lives with, another individual not participating in the food stamp program, another household participating in the food stamp program, or both, unless the allowance is prorated between the household and the other individual, household, or both. If a State agency elects to use a standard utility allowance that reflects heating or cooling costs, it shall be made available to households receiving a payment, or on behalf of which a payment is made, under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.) or other similar energy assistance program, provided that the household still incurs out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses. A State agency may use a separate standard utility allowance for households on behalf of which such payment is made, but may not be required to do so. A State agency not electing to use a separate allowance, and making a single standard utility allowance available to households incurring heating or cooling expenses (other than households described in the sixth sentence of this subsection) may not be required to reduce such allowance due to the provision (direct or indirect) of assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. For purposes of the food stamp program, assistance provided under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 shall be considered to be prorated over the entire heating or cooling season for which it was provided. A State agency shall allow a household to switch between any standard utility allowance and a deduction based on its actual utility costs at the end of any certification period and up to one additional time during each twelve-month period. Households containing an elderly or disabled member shall also be entitled, with respect to expenses other than expenses paid on behalf of the household by a third party, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an excess medical expense deduction for that portion of the actual cost of allowable medical expenses, incurred by elderly or disabled members, exclusive of special diets, that exceed $35 a month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a dependent care deduction, the maximum allowable level of which shall be the same as that contained in clause (1) of the fourth sentence of this subsection, for the actual cost of payments necessary for the care of a dependent, regardless of the dependent's age, when such care enables a household member to accept or continue employment, or training or education that is preparatory for employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an excess shelter expense deduction to the extent that the monthly amount expended by a household for shelter exceeds an amount equal to 50 per centum of monthly household income after all other applicable deductions have been allowed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">State agencies shall offer eligible households a method of claiming a deduction for recurring medical expenses that are initially verified under the excess medical expense deduction provided for in subparagraph (A), in lieu of submitting information or verification on actual expenses on a monthly basis. The method described in the preceding sentence shall be designed to minimize the administrative burden for eligible elderly and disabled household members choosing to deduct their recurrent medical expenses pursuant to such method, shall rely on reasonable estimates of the member's expected medical expenses for the certification period (including changes that can be reasonably anticipated based on available information about the member's medical condition, public or private medical insurance coverage, and the current verified medical expenses incurred by the member), and shall not require further reporting or verification of a change in medical expenses if such a change has been anticipated for the certification period. Before determining the excess shelter expense deduction, all households shall be entitled to a deduction for child support payments made by a household member to or for an individual who is not a member of the household if such household member was legally obligated to make such payments, except that the Secretary is authorized to prescribe by regulation the methods, including calculation on a retrospective basis, that State agencies shall use to determine the amount of the deduction for child support payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Calculation of household income; prospective or retrospective accounting basis; consistency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Household income for those households that, by contract for other than an hourly or piecework basis or by self-employment, derive their annual income in a period of time shorter than one year shall be calculated by averaging such income over a twelve-month period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, household <!-- PDFPage:1051 -->income resulting from the self-employment of a member in a farming operation, who derives income from such farming operation and who has irregular expenses to produce such income, may, at the option of the household, be calculated by averaging such income and expenses over a 12-month period. Notwithstanding the first sentence, if the averaged amount does not accurately reflect the household's actual monthly circumstances because the household has experienced a substantial increase or decrease in business earnings, the State agency shall calculate the self-employment income based on anticipated earnings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Household income for those households that receive nonexcluded income of the type described in subsection (d)(3) of this section shall be calculated by averaging such income over the period for which it is received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), households shall have their incomes calculated on a prospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(A), or, at the option of the State agency, on a retrospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of the first month, or at the option of the State, the first and second months, during a continuous period in which a household is certified, the State agency shall determine eligibility and the amount of benefits on the basis of the household's income and other relevant circumstances in such first or second month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Households specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of section 2015(c)(1)(A) of this title shall have their income calculated on a prospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), households required to submit monthly reports of their income and household circumstances under section 2015(c)(1) of this title shall have their income calculated on a retrospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Calculation of household income on a prospective basis is the calculation of income on the basis of the income reasonably anticipated to be received by the household during the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined. Such calculation shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary which shall provide for taking into account both the income reasonably anticipated to be received by the household during the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined and the income received by the household during the preceding thirty days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Calculation of household income on a retrospective basis is the calculation of income for the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined on the basis of income received in a previous period. Such calculation shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary which may provide for the determination of eligibility on a prospective basis in some or all cases in which benefits are calculated under this paragraph. Such regulations shall provide for supplementing the initial allotments of newly applying households in those cases in which the determination of income under this paragraph causes serious hardship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In promulgating regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order to assure that, to the extent feasible and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], the income of households receiving benefits under this chapter and title IV&ndash;A of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] is calculated on a comparable basis under this chapter and the Social Security Act. The Secretary is authorized, upon the request of a State agency, to waive any of the provisions of this subsection (except the provisions of paragraph (2)(A)) to the extent necessary to permit the State agency to calculate income for purposes of this chapter on the same basis that income is calculated under title IV&ndash;A of the Social Security Act in that State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Allowable financial resources which eligible household may own</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall prescribe the types and allowable amounts of financial resources (liquid and nonliquid assets) an eligible household may own, and shall, in so doing, assure that a household otherwise eligible to participate in the food stamp program will not be eligible to participate if its resources exceed $2,000, or, in the case of a household which consists of or includes a member who is 60 years of age or older, if its resources exceed $3,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall, in prescribing inclusions in, and exclusions from, financial resources, follow the regulations in force as of June 1, 1982 (other than those relating to licensed vehicles and inaccessible resources), and shall, in addition, include in financial resources any boats, snowmobiles, and airplanes used for recreational purposes, any vacation homes, any mobile homes used primarily for vacation purposes, any licensed vehicle (other than one used to produce earned income or that is necessary for transportation of a physically disabled household member and any other property, real or personal, to the extent that it is directly related to the maintenance or use of such vehicle) used for household transportation or used to obtain or continue employment to the extent that the fair market value of any such vehicle exceeds a level set by the Secretary, which shall be $4,500 through August 31, 1994, $4,550 beginning September 1, 1994, through September 30, 1995, $4,600 beginning October 1, 1995, through September 30, 1996, and $5,000 beginning October 1, 1996, as adjusted on such date and on each October 1 thereafter to reflect changes in the new car component of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending on June 30 preceding the date of such adjustment and rounded to the nearest $50, and, regardless of whether there is a penalty for early withdrawal, any savings or retirement accounts (including individual accounts). The Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of a vehicle that a household depends upon to carry fuel for heating or water for home use when such transported fuel or water is the primary source of fuel or water for the household.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of a burial plot for each <!-- PDFPage:1052 -->member of a household and nonliquid resources necessary to allow the household to carry out a plan for self-sufficiency approved by the State agency that constitutes adequate participation in an employment and training program under section 2015(d) of this title. The Secretary shall also exclude from financial resources any earned income tax credits received by any member of the household for a period of 12 months from receipt if such member was participating in the food stamp program at the time the credits were received and participated in such program continuously during the 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of farm property (including land, equipment, and supplies) that is essential to the self-employment of a household member in a farming operation, the Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of such property until the expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date such member ceases to be self-employed in farming.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall promulgate rules by which State agencies shall develop standards for identifying kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, the household is unlikely to be able to sell for any significant return because the household's interest is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's interest would be relatively great. Resources so identified shall be excluded as inaccessible resources. A resource shall be so identified if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. The Secretary shall not require the State agency to require verification of the value of a resource to be excluded under this paragraph unless the State agency determines that the information provided by the household is questionable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Temporary emergency standards of eligibility; Food Stamp Disaster Task Force; direct assistance to State and local officials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, after consultation with the official empowered to exercise the authority provided for by sections 5170a and 5192 of title 42, establish temporary emergency standards of eligibility for the duration of the emergency for households who are victims of a disaster which disrupts commercial channels of food distribution, if such households are in need of temporary food assistance and if commercial channels of food distribution have again become available to meet the temporary food needs of such households. Such standards as are prescribed for individual emergencies may be promulgated without regard to section 2013(c) of this title or the procedures set forth in section 553 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish a Food Stamp Disaster Task Force to assist States in implementing and operating the disaster program and the regular food stamp program in the disaster area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines that it is cost-effective to send members of the Task Force to the disaster area, the Secretary shall send them to such area as soon as possible after the disaster occurs to provide direct assistance to State and local officials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall provide, by regulation, for emergency allotments to eligible households to replace food destroyed in a disaster. The regulations shall provide for replacement of the value of food actually lost up to a limit approved by the Secretary not greater than the applicable maximum monthly allotment for the household size.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall adjust reporting and other application requirements to be consistent with what is practicable under actual conditions in the affected area. In making this adjustment, the Secretary shall consider the availability of the State agency's offices and personnel and any damage to or disruption of transportation and communication facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Attribution of income and resources to sponsored aliens; coverage, computations, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits under this chapter for an individual who is an alien as described in section 2015(f)(2)(B) of this title, the income and resources of any person who as a sponsor of such individual's entry into the United States executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement with respect to such individual, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse if such spouse is living with the sponsor, shall be deemed to be the income and resources of such individual for a period of three years after the individual's entry into the United States. Any such income deemed to be income of such individual shall be treated as unearned income of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of income of a sponsor, and the sponsor's spouse if living with the sponsor, which shall be deemed to be the unearned income of an alien for any year shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the total yearly rate of earned and unearned income of such sponsor, and such sponsor's spouse if such spouse is living with the sponsor, shall be determined for such year under rules prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount determined under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be reduced by an amount equal to the income eligibility standard as determined under subsection (c) of this section for a household equal in size to the sponsor, the sponsor's spouse if living with the sponsor, and any persons dependent upon or receiving support from the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse if the spouse is living with the sponsor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the monthly income attributed to such alien shall be one-twelfth of the amount calculated under clause (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount of resources of a sponsor, and the sponsor's spouse if living with the sponsor, which shall be deemed to be the resources of an alien for any year shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the total amount of the resources of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse if such spouse is living with the sponsor shall be determined under rules prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount determined under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be reduced by $1,500; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1053 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the resources determined under clause (ii) of this subparagraph shall be deemed to be resources of such alien in addition to any resources of such alien.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Any individual who is an alien shall, during the period of three years after entry into the United States, in order to be an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this chapter, be required to provide to the State agency such information and documentation with respect to the alien's sponsor and sponsor's spouse as may be necessary in order for the State agency to make any determination required under this section, and to obtain any cooperation from such sponsor necessary for any such determination. Such alien shall also be required to provide such information and documentation which such alien or the sponsor provided in support of such alien's immigration application as the State agency may request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall enter into agreements with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General whereby any information available to such persons and required in order to make any determination under this section will be provided by such persons to the Secretary, and whereby such persons shall inform any sponsor of an alien, at the time such sponsor executes an affidavit of support or similar agreement, of the requirements imposed by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Any sponsor of an alien, and such alien, shall be jointly and severably liable for an amount equal to any overpayment made to such alien during the period of three years after such alien's entry into the United States, on account of such sponsor's failure to provide correct information under the provisions of this section, except where such sponsor was without fault, or where good cause for such failure existed. Any such overpayment which is not repaid shall be recovered in accordance with the provisions of section 2022(b)(2) of this title.</p>
