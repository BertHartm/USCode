<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Overall allotment quantity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish the overall quantity of sugar to be allotted for the crop year (in this subpart referred to as the &ldquo;overall allotment quantity&rdquo;) by deducting from the sum of the estimated sugar consumption and reasonable carryover stocks (at the end of the crop year) for the crop year, as determined under section 1359bb(a) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 1,532,000 short tons, raw value; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall adjust the overall allotment quantity to avoid the forfeiture of sugar to the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Marketing allotment for sugar derived from sugar beets and sugar derived from sugarcane</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The overall allotment quantity for the crop year shall be allotted between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sugar derived from sugar beets by establishing a marketing allotment for a crop year at a quantity equal to the product of multiplying the overall allotment quantity for the crop year by 54.35 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) sugar derived from sugarcane by establishing a marketing allotment for a crop year at a quantity equal to the product of multiplying the overall allotment quantity for the crop year by 45.65 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Filling cane sugar and beet sugar allotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cane sugar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each marketing allotment for cane sugar established under this section may only be filled with sugar processed from domestically grown sugarcane.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State cane sugar allotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The allotment for sugar derived from sugarcane shall be further allotted, among the States in the United States in which sugarcane is produced, after a hearing (if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers) and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in a fair and equitable manner as provided in this subsection and section 1359dd(b)(1)(D) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Offshore allotment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Collectively</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Individually</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The collective offshore State allotment provided for under subparagraph (A) shall be further allotted among the offshore States in which sugarcane is produced, after a hearing (if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers) and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) past marketings of sugar, based on the average of the 2 highest years of production of raw cane sugar from the 1996 through 2000 crops;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments for the crop year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) past processings of sugar from sugarcane, based on the 3-year average of the 1998 through 2000 crop years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Mainland allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The allotment for sugar derived from sugarcane, less the amount provided for under paragraph (2), shall be allotted among the mainland States in the United States in which sugarcane is produced, after a hearing (if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers) and on such notice as the Sec<!-- PDFPage:555 -->retary by regulation may prescribe, in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) past marketings of sugar, based on the average of the 2 highest years of production of raw cane sugar from the 1996 through 2000 crops;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments for the crop year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) past processings of sugar from sugarcane, based on the 3 crop years with the greatest processings (in the mainland States collectively) during the 1991 through 2000 crop years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Filling cane sugar allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 1359ee of this title, a State cane sugar allotment established under subsection (e) of this section for a crop year may be filled only with sugar processed from sugarcane grown in the State covered by the allotment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Adjustment of marketing allotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, based on reestimates under section 1359bb(a)(3) of this title, adjust upward or downward marketing allotments in a fair and equitable manner, as the Secretary determines appropriate, to reflect changes in estimated sugar consumption, stocks, production, or imports.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation to processors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any increase or decrease in an allotment, each allocation to a processor of the allotment under section 1359dd of this title, and each proportionate share established with respect to the allotment under section 1359ff(c) of this title, shall be increased or decreased by the same percentage that the allotment is increased or decreased.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Carry-over of reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a marketing allotment for a crop year is required to be reduced during the crop year under this subsection, if, at the time of the reduction, the quantity of sugar marketed exceeds the processor's reduced allocation, the allocation of an allotment next established for the processor shall be reduced by the quantity of the excess sugar marketed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Suspension of allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary estimates or reestimates under section 1359bb(a) of this title, or has reason to believe, that imports of sugars, syrups or molasses for human consumption or to be used for the extraction of sugar for human consumption, whether under a tariff-rate quota or in excess or outside of a tariff-rate quota, will exceed 1,532,000 short tons (raw value equivalent) (excluding any imports attributable to reassignment under paragraph (1)(D) or (2)(C) of section 1359ee(b) of this title), and that the imports would lead to a reduction of the overall allotment quantity, the Secretary shall suspend the marketing allotments established under this section until such time as the imports have been restricted, eliminated, or reduced to or below the level of 1,532,000 short tons (raw value equivalent).</p>
