<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) past marketings of sugar, based on the average of the 2 highest years of production of raw cane sugar from the 1996 through 2000 crops;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments for the crop year; and</p>
