<p class="statutory-body">(C) This subsection and subsection (d) of this section shall not apply to a warehouse that does not have facilities to electronically transmit and receive information to and from the central filing system.

If more than one security interest exist in the cotton reflected on the electronic warehouse receipt, the priority of the security interests shall be determined by the applicable Federal or State law. This subsection is applicable to electronic cotton warehouse receipts and any other security interests covering cotton stored in a cotton warehouse, regardless of whether the warehouse is licensed under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may provide for the fees to be collected by persons operating the central filing system administered by the Department from those persons recording information in the central filing system at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed in regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The fees shall be deposited into a fund which shall be available without fiscal year limitation for the expenses of the Secretary incurred in carrying out subsection (c) of this section and this subsection. Any sums collected or received by the Secretary under this chapter and deposited to the fund and any late payment penalties collected by the Secretary and credited to the fund may be invested by the Secretary in insured or fully collateralized, interest-bearing accounts or, at the discretion of the Secretary, by the Secretary of the Treasury in United States Government debt instruments.
