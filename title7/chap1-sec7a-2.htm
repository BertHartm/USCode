<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Delegation of functions under core principles</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A contract market, derivatives transaction execution facility, or electronic trading facility with respect to a significant price discovery contract may comply with any applicable core principle through delegation of any relevant function to a registered futures association or a registered entity that is not an electronic trading facility.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) New contracts, new rules, and rule amendments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A registered entity may elect to list for trading or accept for clearing any new contract, or other instrument, or may elect to approve and implement any new rule or rule amendment, by providing to the Commission (and the Secretary of the Treasury, in the case of a contract of sale of a government security for future delivery (or option on such a contract) or a rule or rule amendment specifically related to such a contract) a written certification that the new contract or instrument or clearing of the new contract or instrument, new rule, or rule amendment complies with this chapter (including regulations under this chapter).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The new rule or rule amendment described in paragraph (1) shall become effective, pursuant to the certification of the registered entity and notice of such certification to its members (in a manner to be determined by the Commission), on the date that is 10 business days after the date on which the Commission receives the certification (or such shorter period as determined by the Commission by rule or regulation) unless the Commission notifies the registered entity within such time that it is staying the certification because there exist novel or complex issues that require additional time to analyze, an inadequate explanation by the submitting registered entity, or a potential inconsistency with this chapter (including regulations under this chapter).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stay of certification for rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A notification by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) shall stay the certification of the new rule or rule amendment for up to an additional 90 days from the date of the notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A rule or rule amendment subject to a stay pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall become effective, pursuant to the certification of the registered entity, at the expiration of the period described in subparagraph (A) unless the Commission&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) notifies the registered entity during such period that it objects to the proposed <!-- PDFPage:88 -->certification on the grounds that it is inconsistent with this chapter (including regulations under this chapter).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission shall provide a not less than 30-day public comment period, within the 90-day period in which the stay is in effect as described in subparagraph (A), whenever the Commission reviews a rule or rule amendment pursuant to a notification by the Commission under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prior approval</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Prior approval required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a designated contract market shall submit to the Commission for prior approval each rule amendment that materially changes the terms and conditions, as determined by the Commission, in any contract of sale for future delivery of a commodity specifically enumerated in section 1a(10)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7a-2_1_target" name="7a-2_1">1</a></sup> of this title (or any option thereon) traded through its facilities if the rule amendment applies to contracts and delivery months which have already been listed for trading and have open interest.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Deadline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If prior approval is requested under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall take final action on the request not later than 90 days after submission of the request, unless the person submitting the request agrees to an extension of the time limitation established under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Approval</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Rules</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contracts and instruments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall approve a new contract or other instrument unless the Commission finds that the new contract or other instrument would violate this chapter (including regulations).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Event contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In connection with the listing of agreements, contracts, transactions, or swaps in excluded commodities that are based upon the occurrence, extent of an occurrence, or contingency (other than a change in the price, rate, value, or levels of a commodity described in section 1a(2)(i)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7a-2_2_target" name="7a-2_2">2</a></sup> of this title), by a designated contract market or swap execution facility, the Commission may determine that such agreements, contracts, or transactions are contrary to the public interest if the agreements, contracts, or transactions involve&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Any such criteria, conditions, or rules shall consider&mdash;</p>
