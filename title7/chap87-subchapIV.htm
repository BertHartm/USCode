<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compensation or provision of funds</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary makes payments available to producers under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the amount of the payment shall be determined by the Secretary based on the Secretary's estimate of the loss suffered by producers of the commodity involved due to any decrease in the price of the commodity as a result of the suspension.</p>

If the Secretary determines that making the required amount of funds available in a partial fiscal year is impracticable, the Secretary may make all or part of the funds required to be made available in the following fiscal year (in addition to any funds otherwise required under a program to be made available in the following fiscal year).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Short supply embargoes</h4>
