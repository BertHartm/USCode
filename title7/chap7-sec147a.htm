<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

Upon failure to pay such fees when due, the Secretary of Agriculture shall assess a late payment penalty, and such overdue fees shall accrue interest, as required by section 3717 of title 31.

The Secretary of Agriculture shall, pursuant to regulations as prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, suspend performance of services to persons who have failed to pay such fees, late payment penalty and accrued interest.</p>
