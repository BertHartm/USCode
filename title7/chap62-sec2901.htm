<p class="statutory-body">(a) Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) beef and beef products are basic foods that are a valuable part of human diet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the production of beef and beef products plays a significant role in the Nation's economy, beef and beef products are produced by thousands of beef producers and processed by numerous processing entities, and beef and beef products are consumed by millions of people throughout the United States and foreign countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) beef and beef products should be readily available and marketed efficiently to ensure that the people of the United States receive adequate nourishment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets for beef and beef products are vital to the welfare of beef producers and those concerned with marketing, using, and producing beef products, as well as to the general economy of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there exist established State and national organizations conducting beef promotion, research, and consumer education programs that are invaluable to the efforts of promoting the consumption of beef and beef products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) beef and beef products move in interstate and foreign commerce, and beef and beef products that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce of beef and beef products.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It, therefore, is declared to be the policy of Congress that it is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided herein, of an orderly procedure for financing (through assessments on all cattle sold in the United States and on cattle, beef, and beef products imported into the United States) and carrying out a coordinated program of promotion and research designed to strengthen the beef industry's position in the marketplace and to maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for beef and beef products. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the right of individual producers to raise cattle.</p>
