<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans by Secretary of the Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make loans to the Secretary in such amounts in the aggregate for each fiscal year commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1948, as the Congress may from time to time determine to be necessary, either without interest or at such rate of interest per annum, not in excess of the rate provided for in sections 904 and 905 of this title, as the Secretary of the Treasury may determine, upon the security of the obligations of borrowers from the Secretary. Interest rates on the unpaid balance of any loans made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Secretary prior to July 1, 1947, shall be adjusted to the interest rate, if any, established for loans made after June 30, 1947, in accordance with the foregoing provision: <em>Pro<!-- PDFPage:403 -->vided,</em> That such obligations incurred for the purpose of financing the construction and operation of generating plants, electric transmission and distribution lines, or systems and for the purpose of financing the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of facilities to render telephone service shall be fully amortized over a period not to exceed thirty-five years, and that the maturity of such obligations incurred for the purpose of financing the wiring of premises and the acquisition and installation of electrical and plumbing appliances and equipment shall not exceed two-thirds of the assured life thereof and not more than five years. The Secretary is authorized to make all such endorsements, to execute all such instruments, and to do all such acts and things as shall be necessary to effect the valid transfer and assignment to the Secretary of the Treasury of all such obligations, and to execute such trust instruments as shall be agreed upon by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury providing for the holding in trust by the Secretary of all such obligations for the Secretary of the Treasury as security for loans to the Secretary heretofore made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or made or to be made by the Secretary of the Treasury. All rights, interest, obligations, and duties of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation arising out of loans made or authorized to be made to the Secretary are, as of the close of June 30, 1947, vested in the Secretary of the Treasury; the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is authorized and directed to transfer, as of the close of June 30, 1947, to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive all loans outstanding on that date, plus accrued unpaid interest, theretofore made to the Secretary under the provisions of this chapter, and all notes and other evidences thereof and all obligations constituting the security therefor. The Secretary of the Treasury shall cancel notes of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and sums due and unpaid upon or in connection with such notes at the time of such cancellation, in an amount equal to the unpaid principal of the loans so transferred, plus accrued unpaid interest through June 30, 1947. Subsequent to June 30, 1947, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation shall make no further loans or advances to the Secretary; and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed, in lieu of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, to lend or advance to the Secretary, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, any unobligated or unadvanced balances of the sums which the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has theretofore been authorized and directed to lend to the Secretary. For the purpose of making loans or advances pursuant to this section, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include such loans or advances to the Secretary. Repayments to the Secretary of the Treasury on such loans or advances shall be treated as a public-debt transaction of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Twenty-five per centum of the annual sums herein made available or appropriated for loans for rural electrification pursuant to sections 904 and 905 of this title shall be allotted yearly by the Secretary for loans in the several States in the proportion which the number of their farms not then receiving central station electric service bears to the total number of farms of the United States not then receiving such service: <em>Provided,</em> That if any part of such sums are not loaned or obligated during the first six months of the fiscal year for which they are made available, such part shall thereafter be available for loans by the Secretary without allotment: <em>Provided, however,</em> That not more than 25 per centum of said sums may be employed in any one State or in all of the Territories. The Secretary shall within ninety days after the beginning of each fiscal year determine for each State and for the United States the number of farms not then receiving such service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loans of unallotted funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The remaining 75 per centum of such annual sums shall be available for rural electrification loans in the several States and in the Territories, without allotment as hereinabove provided in such amounts for each State and Territory as, in the opinion of the Secretary, may be effectively employed for the purposes of this chapter, and to carryout the provisions of section 907 of this title: <em>Provided, however,</em> That not more than 25 per centum of said unallotted annual sums may be employed in any one State, or in all of the Territories.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Unexpended funds; limitation on use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any part of the annual sums made available for the purposes of this chapter are not loaned or obligated during the fiscal year for which they are made available, such unexpended or unobligated sums shall be available for loans by the Secretary in the following year or years without allotment: <em>Provided, however,</em> That not more than 25 per centum of said sums for rural electrification loans may be employed in any one State or in all of the Territories.</p>
