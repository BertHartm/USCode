<p class="note-body">The date of enactment of this section, referred to in subsec. (a), is the date of enactment of Pub. L. 110&ndash;246, which was approved June 18, 2008.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8605 of this title, referred to in subsec. (e), was in the original &ldquo;section 9008(d) of the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 (7 U.S.C. 8605)&rdquo;, and was translated as meaning section 306 of title III of Pub. L. 106&ndash;224, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because title III of Pub. L. 106&ndash;224, known as the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, does not contain a section 9008 and section 306 of the Act related to the establishment of the Biomass Research and Development Technical Advisory Committee, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 110&ndash;246, title IX, &sect;9001(b), June 18, 2008, 122 Stat. 2095.</p>
