<p class="statutory-body-block">for research and extension to facilitate or expand promising advances in the production and marketing of aquacultural food species and products and to enhance further the safety and wholesomeness of those species and products, including the development of reliable supplies of seed stock and therapeutic compounds. Except in the case of Federal laboratories, no grant may be made under this subsection unless the State in which the grant recipient is located makes a matching grant (of which amount an in-kind contribution may not exceed 50 percent) to such recipient equal to the amount of the grant to be made under this subsection, and unless the grant is in implementation of the na<!-- PDFPage:1260 -->tional aquaculture development plan, and revisions thereto, developed under the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 [16 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aquaculture development plans</h4>

Funds made available for the operation of such regional centers may be used for the rehabilitation of existing buildings or facilities to house such centers, but may not be used for the construction or acquisition of new buildings or facilities. To the extent practicable, the aquaculture research, development, and demonstration centers established under this subsection shall be geographically located so that they are representative of the regional aquaculture opportunities in the United States. To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall ensure that equitable efforts are made at these centers in addressing the research needs of those segments of the domestic aquaculture industry located within that region.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Listing of laws on aquaculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interagency aquaculture coordinating group established under section 6(a) of the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. 2805(a)) shall, in consultation with appropriate Federal and State agencies, compile a listing of Federal and State laws, rules, and regulations materially affecting the production, processing, marketing, and transportation of aquaculturally produced commodities and the products thereof.
