Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yields of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this chapter. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and for that purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Farmers Home Administration direct loan account; deposits; liabilities; obligations; expenditures; net expenditure basis of budgeting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The appropriations for loans made under the authority of subsection (a) of this section and funds obtained in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the unexpended balances of any funds made available for loans under the item &ldquo;Farmers Home Administration&rdquo; in the Department of Agriculture Appropriation Acts current on August 8, 1961, shall be merged into a single account known as the &ldquo;Farmers Home Administration direct loan account&rdquo;, hereafter in this section called the &ldquo;direct loan account&rdquo;. All claims, notes, mortgages, property, including those now held by the Secretary on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, and all collections therefrom, made or held under the direct loan provisions of (1) titles I, II, and IV of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended; (2) the Farmers Home Administration Act of 1946, as amended, except the assets of the rural rehabilitation corporations; (3) the Act of August 28, 1937 (50 Stat. 869), as amended; (4) the item &ldquo;Loans to Farmers&mdash;1948 Flood Damage&rdquo; in the Act of June 25, 1948 (62 Stat. 1038); (5) the item &ldquo;Loans to Farmers (Property Damage)&rdquo; in the Act of May 24, 1949 (63 Stat. 82); (6) the Act of September 6, 1950 (64 Stat. 769); (7) the Act of July 11, 1956 (70 Stat. 525); (8) section 8 of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, as amended [16 U.S.C. 1006a]; (9) section 32(e) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1011(e)]; and (10) under this chapter shall be held for and deposited in said account.</p>

Moneys in the direct loan account shall also be available for interest and principal repayments on notes issued by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury. Otherwise, the balances in said account shall remain available to the Secretary for direct loans under subchapters I or II of this chapter, section 8 of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, as amended [16 U.S.C. 1006a], and section 32(e) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1011(e)], and for advances in connection therewith, not to exceed any existing appropriation or authorization limitations and in such further amounts as the Congress from time to time determines in appropriation Acts. The amounts so authorized for loans and advances shall remain available until expended. Subject to the foregoing limitations, the use of collections deposited in the account may be authorized by the Congress in lieu or partially in lieu of authorizing the issuing of additional notes by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the account shall be budgeted on a net expenditure basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Sale of notes and mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may sell and assign any notes and mortgages in the direct loan account with the consent of the borrower or without such consent when the borrower has failed to comply with his agreement to refinance the indebtedness at the request of the Secretary. Such loans may be sold at the balance due thereon or on such other basis as the Secretary may determine from time to time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distribution of real estate loans among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At least 25 per centum of the sums authorized in any fiscal year for direct loans to individuals to be made by the Secretary under subchapter I of this chapter shall be allocated equitably among the several States and territories on the basis of farm population and the prevalence of tenancy, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The guaranteed portion of any loan made under this chapter may be sold by the lender, and by any subsequent holder, in accordance with regulations governing such sales as the Secretary shall establish, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) All fees due the Secretary with respect to a guaranteed loan are to be paid in full before any sale.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:993 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The loan is to have been fully disbursed to the borrower before the sale.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After a loan is sold in the secondary market, the lender shall remain obligated under its guarantee agreement with the Secretary, and shall continue to service the loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for determining the increase of farmers&rsquo; access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This subsection shall not be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made under this chapter, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may, directly or through a market maker approved by the Secretary, issue pool certificates representing ownership of part or all of the guaranteed portion of any loan guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter. Such certificates shall be based on and backed by a pool established or approved by the Secretary and composed solely of the entire guaranteed portion of such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, guarantee the timely payment of the principal and interest on pool certificates issued on behalf of the Secretary by approved market makers for purposes of this subsection. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans that compose the pool. If a loan in such pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or by reason of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the pool certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Secretary only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the pool certificate, the certificate may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts that may be required to be paid under any guarantee of such pool certificates issued by approved market makers under this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) pay the registered holder of the certificates an amount equal to the guaranteed portion of the loan represented by the certificate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) If the Secretary pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, the claim shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment, as may be provided by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Secretary of the Secretary's ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the pool against which the certificates are issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the adoption of final rules and regulations, the Secretary shall do the following:</p>

As used in this subparagraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term &ldquo;seller&rdquo; does not include (i) the person who made the loan or (ii) any person who sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Provide for adequate custody of any pooled guaranteed loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Take such actions as are necessary, in restructuring pools of the guaranteed portion of loans, to minimize the estimated costs of paying claims under guarantees issued under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Require each market maker&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to service all pools formed, and participations sold, by the market maker; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to provide the Secretary with information relating to the collection and disbursement of all periodic payments, prepayments, and default funds from lenders, to or from the reserve fund that the Secretary shall establish to enable the timely payment guarantee to be self-funding, and from all beneficial holders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Regulate market makers in pool certificates sold under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Not later than March 31 of each year, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives a report on the secondary market operations under this subsection during the preceding calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) an analysis of the information reported in clauses (i) through (vii) to assess farmers&rsquo; access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
