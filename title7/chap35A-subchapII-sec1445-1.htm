<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amount of producer contributions and purchaser assessments shall be determined in such a manner that producers and purchasers share equally, to the maximum extent practicable, in maintaining the Fund of an association. In making such determination with respect to the assessment of a purchaser, only 1985 and subsequent crops of Flue-cured and Burley quota tobacco shall be taken into account. The Secretary shall approve the amount of the contributions and assessments determined by an association from time to time under this paragraph only if the Secretary determines that such amount will result in accumulation of a Fund adequate to reimburse the Corporation for any net losses which the Corporation may sustain under its loan agreements with the association, based on reasonable estimates of the amounts which the Corporation will lend to the association under such agreements and the proceeds which will be realized from the sales of tobacco which are pledged to the Corporation by the association as security for loans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) require that any producer contribution or purchaser or importer assessment due under paragraph (1) shall be collected&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) require that loan agreements between the Corporation and the association provide that the Corporation shall retain the net gains from each of the 1982 and subsequent crops of tobacco pledged by the association as security for price support loans, and that such net gains will be used for the purpose of (A) offsetting any losses sustained by the Corporation under its loan agreements with the association for any of the 1982 and subsequent crops of loan tobacco, or (B) reducing the outstanding balance of any price support loan made by the Corporation to the association under such agreements for 1982 and subsequent crops of tobacco, or for both such purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) effective for the 1982 through 1985 crops of quota tobacco, provide, in loan agreements between the Corporation and an association, that if the Secretary determines that the amount in the Fund or the net gains referred to in paragraph (5) exceed the amounts necessary for the purposes specified in this section, such excess (A) in the case of an association making price support available to producers of quota tobacco other than Burley tobacco, will be released to the association by the Corporation and may be devoted to other purposes by the association, and (B) in the case of an association making price support available to producers of Burley quota tobacco, will be released to the association by the Corporation and may be distributed, as determined by the association, to the producer-members of the association as a capital distribution or net gain distribution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) effective for the 1986 and subsequent crops of quota tobacco, provide, in loan agreements between the Corporation and an association, that if the Secretary determines that the amount in the Fund or the net gains referred to in paragraph (5) exceeds the amounts necessary for the purposes specified in this section, the association, with the approval of the Secretary, may suspend the payment and collection of contributions and assessments under this section on terms and conditions established by the association, with the approval of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If any association which has entered into a loan agreement with the Corporation with respect to 1982 or subsequent crops of quota tobacco fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of this section, the regulations issued by the Secretary thereunder, or the terms of such agreement, the Secretary may terminate such agreement or provide that no additional loan funds may be made available thereunder to the association. In such event, the Secretary shall make price support available to producers of the kind or kinds of tobacco, the price of which had been supported through loans to such association, through such other means as are authorized by this Act or the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act [15 U.S.C. 714 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination of loan agreement; dissolution or merger of association; disposition of amounts in Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, under subsection (e) of this section, a loan agreement with an association is terminated, or if an association having a loan agreement with the Corporation is dissolved, merges with another association, or otherwise ceases to operate, the Fund or the net gains referred to in subsection (d)(5) of this section shall be applied or disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may approve or prescribe, except that they shall, to the extent necessary, first be applied or used for the purposes therefor prescribed in this section.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:698 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) Each importer who fails to pay to the association an assessment as required by subsection (d)(2) of this section at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, shall be liable, in addition to any amount due, for a marketing penalty at a rate equal to 75 percent of the average market price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for the respective kind of tobacco for the immediately preceding year on the quantity of tobacco as to which the failure occurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may reduce any such marketing penalty in such amount as the Secretary determines equitable in any case in which the Secretary determines that the failure was unintentional or without knowledge on the part of the person concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Any penalty provided for under this paragraph shall be assessed by the Secretary after notice and opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this subsection may obtain review of such penalty in an appropriate district court of the United States by filing a civil action in such court not later than 30 days after such penalty is imposed.</p>
