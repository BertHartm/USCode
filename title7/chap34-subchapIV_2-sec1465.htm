<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide for the establishment of a farm program payment yield for each farm for each program crop for each crop year in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Farm program payment yields based on 1990 crop year</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that farm program payment yields shall be established in accordance with this subsection, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the farm program payment yield for each of the 1991 through 1997 crop years shall be the farm program payment yield for the 1990 crop year for the farm.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional yield payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of each of the 1991 through 1997 crop years for a commodity, if the farm program payment yield for a farm is reduced more than 10 percent below the farm program payment yield for the 1985 crop year, the Secretary shall make available to producers established price payments for the commodity in such amount as the Secretary determines is necessary to provide the same total return to producers as if the farm program payment yield had not been reduced more than 10 percent below the farm program payment yield for the 1985 crop year. The payments shall be made available not later than the time final deficiency payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No crop or yield available</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no crop of the commodity was produced on the farm or no farm program payment yield was established for the farm for any of the 1981 through 1985 crop years (or, as appropriate, the 1986 through 1990 crop years), the farm program payment yield shall be established on the basis of the average farm program payment yield for the crop years for similar farms in the area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) National, State, or county yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines the action is necessary, the Secretary may establish national, State, or county program payment yields on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) historical yields, as adjusted by the Secretary to correct for abnormal factors affecting the yields in the historical period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary's estimate of actual yields for the crop year involved if historical yield data is not available.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Balancing yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If national, State, or county program payment yields are established, the farm program payment yields shall balance to the national, State, or county program payment yields.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of yields</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Actual yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the 1991 and subsequent crop years, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish the farm program payment yield as provided in subsection (a) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish a farm program payment yield for any program crop for any farm on the basis of the average of the yield per harvested acre for the crop for the farm for each of the 5 crop years immediately preceding the crop year, excluding the crop year with the highest yield per harvested acre, the crop year with the lowest yield per harvested acre, and any crop year in which such crop was not planted on the farm.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prior yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the farm program payment yield for the 1986 crop year and the actual yield per harvested acre with respect to the 1987 and subsequent crop years shall be used in determining farm program payment yields.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduction limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, for purposes of establishing a farm program payment yield for any program crop for any farm for the 1991 and subsequent crop years, the farm program payment yield for the 1986 crop year may not be reduced more than 10 percent below the farm program payment yield for the farm for the 1985 crop year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Adjustment of yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The county committee, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, may adjust any farm program payment yield for any program crop for any farm if the farm program payment yield for the crop on the farm does not accurately reflect the productive potential of the farm.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment of yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any farm for which the actual yield per harvested acre for any program crop referred to in subsection (c) of this section for any crop year is not available, the county committee may assign the farm a yield for the crop for the crop year on the basis of actual yields for the crop for the crop year on similar farms in the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Actual yield data</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, allow producers to provide to county committees data with respect to the actual yield for each farm for each program crop.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Maintenance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall maintain the data for at least 5 crop years after receipt in a manner that will permit the data to be used, if necessary, in the administration of the commodity programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:716 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide timely notification to producers of the provisions of this subsection.</p>
