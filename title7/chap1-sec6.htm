<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Restriction of futures trading to contract markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless exempted by the Commission pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to offer to enter into, to enter into, to execute, to confirm the execution of, or to conduct any office or business anywhere in the United States, its territories or possessions, for the purpose of soliciting or accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in, any transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery (other than a contract which is made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, exchange, or market located outside the United States, its territories or possessions) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade which has been designated by the Commission as a &ldquo;contract market&rdquo; for such commodity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such contract is executed or consummated by or through a member of such contract market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such contract is evidenced by a record in writing which shows the date, the parties to such contract and their addresses, the property covered and its price, and the terms of delivery: <em>Provided</em>, That each contract market member shall keep such record for a period of three years from the date thereof, or for a longer period if the Commission shall so direct, which record shall at all times be open to the inspection of any representative of the Commission or the Department of Justice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulation of foreign transactions by United States persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may adopt rules and regulations proscribing fraud and requiring minimum financial standards, the disclosure of risk, the filing of reports, the keeping of books and records, the safeguarding of customers&rsquo; funds, and registration with the Commission by any person located in the United States, its territories or possessions, who engages in the offer or sale of any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery that is made or to be made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, exchange, or market located outside the United States, its territories or possessions. Such rules <!-- PDFPage:16 -->and regulations may impose different requirements for such persons depending upon the particular foreign board of trade, exchange, or market involved. No rule or regulation may be adopted by the Commission under this subsection that (1) requires Commission approval of any contract, rule, regulation, or action of any foreign board of trade, exchange, or market, or clearinghouse for such board of trade, exchange, or market, or (2) governs in any way any rule or contract term or action of any foreign board of trade, exchange, or market, or clearinghouse for such board of trade, exchange, or market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Public interest exemption from contract market requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to promote responsible economic or financial innovation and fair competition, the Commission by rule, regulation, or order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may (on its own initiative or on application of any person, including any board of trade designated as a contract market for transactions for future delivery in any commodity under section 7 of this title) exempt any agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) that is otherwise subject to subsection (a) of this section (including any person or class of persons offering, entering into, rendering advice or rendering other services with respect to, the agreement, contract, or transaction), either unconditionally or on stated terms or conditions or for stated periods and either retroactively or prospectively, or both, from any of the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, or from any other provision of this chapter (except section 2a of this title), if the Commission determines that the exemption would be consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall not grant any exemption under paragraph (1) from any of the requirements of subsection (a) of this section unless the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the requirement should not be applied to the agreement, contract, or transaction for which the exemption is sought and that the exemption would be consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the agreement, contract, or transaction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will be entered into solely between appropriate persons; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Commission or any contract market to discharge its regulatory or self-regulatory duties under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) A corporation, partnership, proprietorship, organization, trust, or other business entity with a net worth exceeding $1,000,000 or total assets exceeding $5,000,000, or the obligations of which under the agreement, contract or transaction are guaranteed or otherwise supported by a letter of credit or keepwell, support, or other agreement by any such entity or by an entity referred to in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (H), (I), or (K) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) An employee benefit plan with assets exceeding $1,000,000, or whose investment decisions are made by a bank, trust company, insurance company, investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80b&ndash;1 et seq.], or a commodity trading advisor subject to regulation under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Any governmental entity (including the United States, any state,<sup><a href="#6_1_target" name="6_1">1</a></sup> or any foreign government) or political subdivision thereof, or any multinational or supranational entity or any instrumentality, agency, or department of any of the foregoing.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) During the pendency of an application for an order granting an exemption under paragraph (1), the Commission may limit the public availability of any information received from the applicant if the applicant submits a written request to limit disclosure contemporaneous with the application, and the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the information sought to be restricted constitutes a trade secret; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) public disclosure of the information would result in material competitive harm to the applicant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promptly following October 28, 1992, or upon application by any person, exercise the exemptive authority granted under paragraph (1) with respect to classes of hybrid instruments that are predominantly securities or depository instruments, to the extent that such instruments may be regarded as subject to the provisions of this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) promptly following October 28, 1992, or upon application by any person, exercise the exemptive authority granted under paragraph (1) effective as of October 23, 1974, with respect to classes of swap agreements (as defined in section 101 of title 11) that are not part of a fungible class of agreements that are standardized as to their material economic terms, to the extent that such agreements may be regarded as subject to the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any exemption pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the <!-- PDFPage:17 -->Commission shall determine to be appropriate pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of exemption on investigative authority of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The granting of an exemption under this section shall not affect the authority of the Commission under any other provision of this chapter to conduct investigations in order to determine compliance with the requirements or conditions of such exemption or to take enforcement action for any violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule, regulation or order thereunder caused by the failure to comply with or satisfy such conditions or requirements.</p>
