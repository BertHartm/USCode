<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such contract is evidenced by a record in writing which shows the date, the parties to such contract and their addresses, the property covered and its price, and the terms of delivery: <em>Provided</em>, That each contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility member shall keep such record for a period of three years from the date thereof, or for a longer period if the Commission shall so direct, which record shall at all times be open to the inspection of any representative of the Commission or the Department of Justice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulation of foreign transactions by United States persons</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign boards of trade</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Registration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may adopt rules and regulations requiring registration with the Commission for a foreign board of trade that provides the members of the foreign board of trade or other participants located in the United States with direct access to the electronic trading and order matching system of the foreign board of trade, including rules and regulations prescribing procedures and requirements applicable to the registration of such foreign boards of trade. For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;direct access&rdquo; refers to an explicit grant of authority by a foreign board of trade to an identified member or other participant located in the United States to enter trades directly into the trade matching system of the foreign board of trade. In adopting such rules and regulations, the commission&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6_1_target" name="6_1">1</a></sup> shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether any such foreign board of trade is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in the foreign board of trade's home country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any previous commission&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6_1_target" name="6_1">1</a></sup> findings that the foreign board of trade is subject to comparable comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate government authorities in the foreign board of trade's home country.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Linked contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may not permit a foreign board of trade to provide to the members of the foreign board of trade or other participants located in the United States direct access to the electronic trading and order-matching system of the foreign board of trade with respect to an agreement, contract, or transaction that settles against any price (including the daily or final settlement price) of 1 or more contracts listed for trading on a registered entity, unless the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:43 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the foreign board of trade makes public daily trading information regarding the agreement, contract, or transaction that is comparable to the daily trading information published by the registered entity for the 1 or more contracts against which the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade settles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foreign board of trade (or the foreign futures authority that oversees the foreign board of trade)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) adopts position limits (including related hedge exemption provisions) for the agreement, contract, or transaction that are comparable to the position limits (including related hedge exemption provisions) adopted by the registered entity for the 1 or more contracts against which the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade settles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) has the authority to require or direct market participants to limit, reduce, or liquidate any position the foreign board of trade (or the foreign futures authority that oversees the foreign board of trade) determines to be necessary to prevent or reduce the threat of price manipulation, excessive speculation as described in section 6a of this title, price distortion, or disruption of delivery or the cash settlement process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) agrees to promptly notify the Commission, with regard to the agreement, contract, or transaction that settles against any price (including the daily or final settlement price) of 1 or more contracts listed for trading on a registered entity, of any change regarding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) the information that the foreign board of trade will make publicly available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) the position limits that the foreign board of trade or foreign futures authority will adopt and enforce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(cc) the position reductions required to prevent manipulation, excessive speculation as described in section 6a of this title, price distortion, or disruption of delivery or the cash settlement process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(dd) any other area of interest expressed by the Commission to the foreign board of trade or foreign futures authority;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) provides information to the Commission regarding large trader positions in the agreement, contract, or transaction that is comparable to the large trader position information collected by the Commission for the 1 or more contracts against which the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade settles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) provides the Commission such information as is necessary to publish reports on aggregate trader positions for the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade that are comparable to such reports on aggregate trader positions for the 1 or more contracts against which the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade settles.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Existing foreign boards of trade</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not be effective with respect to any foreign board of trade to which, prior to July 21, 2010, the Commission granted direct access permission until the date that is 180 days after July 21, 2010.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Persons located in the United States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may adopt rules and regulations proscribing fraud and requiring minimum financial standards, the disclosure of risk, the filing of reports, the keeping of books and records, the safeguarding of customers&rsquo; funds, and registration with the Commission by any person located in the United States, its territories or possessions, who engages in the offer or sale of any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery that is made or to be made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, exchange, or market located outside the United States, its territories or possessions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Different requirements</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2), no rule or regulation may be adopted by the Commission under this subsection that&mdash;</p>
