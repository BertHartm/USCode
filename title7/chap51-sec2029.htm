<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall permit any political subdivision, in any State, that applies and submits a plan to the Secretary in compliance with guidelines promulgated by the Secretary to operate a workfare program pursuant to which every member of a household participating in the food stamp program who is not exempt by virtue of the provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall accept an offer from such subdivision to perform work on its behalf, or may seek an offer to perform work, in return for compensation consisting of the allotment to which the household is entitled under section 2017(a) of this title, with each hour of such work entitling that household to a portion of its allotment equal in value to 100 per centum of the higher of the applicable State minimum wage or the Federal minimum hourly rate under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall promulgate guidelines pursuant to paragraph (1) which, to the maximum extent practicable, enable a political subdivision to design and operate a workfare program under this section which is compatible and consistent with similar workfare programs operated by the subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A political subdivision may comply with the requirements of this section by operating any workfare program which the Secretary determines meets the provisions and protections provided under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exempt household members</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Valuation or duration of work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No operating agency shall require any participating member to work in any workfare position to the extent that such work exceeds in value the allotment to which the household is otherwise entitled or that such work, when added to any other hours worked during such week by such member for compensation (in cash or in kind) in any other capacity, exceeds thirty hours a week.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nature, conditions, and costs of work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The operating agency shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reimburse participants for actual costs of transportation and other actual costs all of which are reasonably necessary and directly related to participation in the program but not to exceed $25 in the aggregate per month.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) From 50 per centum of the funds saved from employment related to a workfare program operated under this section, the Secretary shall pay to each operating agency an amount not to exceed the administrative expenses described in paragraph (1) for which no reimbursement is provided under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;funds saved from employment related to a workfare program operated under this section&rdquo; means an amount equal to three times the dollar value of the decrease in allotments issued to households, to the extent that such decrease results from wages received by members of such households for the first month of employment beginning after the date such members commence such employment if such employment commences&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) while such members are participating for the first time in a workfare program operated under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the thirty-day period beginning on the date such first participation is terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may suspend or cancel some or all of these payments, or may withdraw approval from a political subdivision to operate a workfare program, upon a finding that the subdivision has failed to comply with the workfare requirements.</p>
