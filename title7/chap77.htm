<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4601. Findings and purposes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1417 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Honey is produced by many individual producers in every State in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Honey and honey products move in large part in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce, and honey which does not move in such channels directly burdens or affects interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In recent years, large quantities of low-cost, imported honey have been brought into the United States, replacing domestic honey in the normal trade channels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The maintenance and expansion of existing honey markets and the development of new or improved markets or uses are vital to the welfare of honey producers and those concerned with marketing, using, and processing honey, along with those engaged in general agricultural endeavors requiring bees for pollinating purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The honey production industry within the United States is comprised mainly of small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The development and implementation of coordinated programs of research, promotion, consumer education, and industry information necessary for the maintenance of markets and the development of new markets have been inadequate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Without cooperative action in providing for and financing such programs, honey producers, honey handlers, wholesalers, and retailers are unable to implement programs of research, promotion, consumer education, and industry information necessary to maintain and improve markets for these products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The ability to develop and maintain purity standards for honey and honey products is critical to maintaining the consumer confidence, safety, and trust that are essential components of any undertaking to maintain and develop markets for honey and honey products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Research directed at improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of beekeeping, as well as developing better means of dealing with pest and disease problems, is essential to keeping honey and honey product prices competitive and facilitating market growth as well as maintaining the financial well-being of the honey industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Research involving the quality, safety, and image of honey and honey products and how that quality, safety, and image may be affected during the extraction, processing, packaging, marketing, and other stages of the honey and honey product production and distribution process, is highly important to building and maintaining markets for honey and honey products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to authorize the establishment of an orderly procedure for the development and financing, through an adequate assessment, of an effective, continuous, and nationally coordinated program of promotion, research, consumer education, and industry information designed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) strengthen the position of the honey industry in the marketplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) maintain, develop, and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for honey and honey products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) maintain and improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the honey industry; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) sponsor research to develop better means of dealing with pest and disease problems;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to maintain and expand the markets for all honey and honey products in a manner that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is not designed to maintain or expand any individual producer's, importer's, or handler's share of the market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not compete with or replace individual advertising or promotion efforts designed to promote individual brand name or trade name honey or honey products; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to authorize and fund programs that result in government speech promoting government objectives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prohibits the sale of various grades of honey;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides for control of honey production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) limits the right of the individual honey producer to produce honey; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) creates a trade barrier to honey or honey products produced in a foreign country.</p>

The facts relating to any civil action authorized to be brought under this subsection shall be referred to the Attorney General for appropriate action. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the Secretary to refer to the Attorney General violations of this chapter whenever the Secretary believes that the administration and enforcement of any such order or regulation would be adequately served by administrative action under subsection (b) of this section or suitable written notice or warning to any person committing such violations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Civil penalties; notice and hearing; review; courts of appeals; cease and desist orders; failure to obey; Attorney General</h4>

Each violation shall be a separate of<!-- PDFPage:1429 -->fense. In addition to or in lieu of such civil penalty the Secretary may issue an order requiring such person to cease and desist from continuing such violations. No penalty shall be assessed or cease and desist order issued unless such person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary with respect to such violation, and the order of the Secretary assessing a penalty or imposing a cease and desist order shall be final and conclusive unless the affected person files an appeal from the Secretary's order with the appropriate United States court of appeals.</p>

The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found. The findings of the Secretary shall be set aside only if found to be unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person who fails to obey a cease and desist order after it has become final and unappealable, or after the appropriate court of appeals has entered a final judgment in favor of the Secretary, shall be subject to a civil penalty assessed by the Secretary, after opportunity for a hearing and for judicial review under the procedures specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of not more than $500 for each offense, and each day during which such failure continues shall be deemed a separate offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court of appeals has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General for recovery of the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States.
