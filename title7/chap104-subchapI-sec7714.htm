<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is the progeny of any plant, biological control organism, plant product, plant pest, or noxious weed that is moving into or through the United States or interstate, or has moved into the United States or interstate, in violation of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority to order an owner to treat or destroy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may order the owner of any plant, biological control organism, plant product, plant pest, noxious weed, article, or means of conveyance subject to action under subsection (a) of this section to treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the plant, biological control organism, plant product, plant pest, noxious weed, article, or means of conveyance, without cost to the Federal Government and in the manner the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the owner fails to comply with the Secretary's order under this subsection, the Secretary may take an action authorized by subsection (a) of this section and recover from the owner the costs of any care, handling, application of remedial measures, or disposal incurred by the Secretary in connection with actions taken under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Classification system</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Development required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To facilitate control of noxious weeds, the Secretary may develop a classification system to describe the status and action levels for noxious weeds.
