<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sugar estimates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the beginning of each of the fiscal years 1992 through 1998, the Secretary shall estimate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the quantity of sugar that will be consumed in the United States during the fiscal year (other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in refined form or in sugar containing products) and the quantity of sugar that would provide for reasonable carryover stocks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the quantity of sugar that will be available from carry-in stocks or from domestically-produced sugarcane and sugar beets for consumption in the United States during the year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the quantity of sugar that will be imported for consumption in the United States during the year (other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in a refined form or in sugar containing products), based on the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sum of the quantity of estimated consumption and reasonable carryover stocks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the quantity of sugar estimated to be available from domestically-produced sugarcane and sugar beets and from carry-in stocks.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Quarterly reestimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make quarterly reestimates of sugar consumption, stocks, production, and imports for a fiscal year no later than the beginning of each of the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sugar allotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year in which the Secretary estimates, under subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, that imports of sugar for consumption in the United States (other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in refined form or in sugar containing products) will be less than 1,250,000 short tons, raw value, the Secretary shall establish for that year appropriate allotments under section 1359cc of this title for the marketing by processors of sugar processed from domestically-produced sugarcane and sugar beets, at a level that the Secretary estimates will result in imports of sugar of not less than 1,250,000 short tons, raw value, for that year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may include sugar products, whose majority content is sucrose or crystalline fructose for human consumption, derived from sugarcane, sugar beets, molasses or sugar in the allotments under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines it to be appropriate for purposes of this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Crystalline fructose allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any fiscal year in which the Secretary establishes allotments for the marketing of sugar <!-- PDFPage:595 -->under section 1359cc of this title, the Secretary shall establish for that year appropriate allotments for the marketing by manufacturers of crystalline fructose manufactured from corn, at a total level not to exceed the equivalent of 200,000 tons of sugar, raw value, during the fiscal year, in a manner that is fair, efficient, and equitable to manufacturers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prohibitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During any fiscal year or portion thereof for which marketing allotments have been established, no processor of sugar beets or sugarcane shall market a quantity of sugar in excess of the allocation established for such processor, except to enable another processor to fulfill an allocation established for such other processor or to facilitate the exportation of such sugar.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Crystalline fructose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time crystalline fructose allotments are in effect for manufacturers under subsection (c) of this section, no manufacturer may market crystalline fructose in excess of the manufacturer's allotment. No restrictions or allotments shall be established on the marketings of any liquid fructose produced from corn.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any processor who knowingly violates paragraph (1) or manufacturer who knowingly violates paragraph (2) shall be liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty in an amount equal to 3 times the United States market value, at the time of the commission of the violation, of that quantity of sugar or crystalline fructose involved in the violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) &ldquo;Market&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subpart, the term &ldquo;market&rdquo; shall mean to sell or otherwise dispose of in commerce in the United States (including, with respect to any integrated processor and refiner, the movement of raw cane sugar into the refining process).</p>

<!-- PDFPage:596 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Overall allotment quantity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish the overall quantity of sugar to be allotted for the fiscal year (hereafter in this subpart referred to as the &ldquo;overall allotment quantity&rdquo;) by deducting from the sum of the estimated sugar consumption and reasonable carryover stocks (at the end of the fiscal year) for the fiscal year, as determined under section 1359bb(a) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 1,250,000 short tons, raw value; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Percentage factors</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish percentage factors for the overall beet sugar and cane sugar allotments applicable for a fiscal year. The Secretary shall establish the percentage factors in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings of sugar (considering for such purposes the marketings of sugar processed from sugarcane and sugar beets of any or all of the 1985 through 1989 crops), processing and refining capacity, and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall publish these percentage factors in the Federal Register, along with a description of the Secretary's reasons for establishing the factors, as provided in section 1359hh(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Marketing allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The marketing allotment for sugar derived from sugarcane and the marketing allotment for sugar derived from sugar beets for a fiscal year, in each case, shall be a quantity equal to the product of multiplying the overall allotment quantity for the fiscal year by the percentage factor established by the Secretary under subsection (d)(1) of this section for the allotment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State cane sugar allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The allotment for sugar derived from sugarcane shall be further allotted, among the 5 States in the United States in which sugarcane is produced, in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings of sugar (considering for such purposes the average of marketings of sugar processed from sugarcane in the 2 highest years of production from each State from the 1985 through 1989 crops), processing capacity, and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish marketing allotments for the fiscal year or any portion of such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) suspend the allotments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation to processors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any increase or decrease in an allotment, each allocation to a processor of the allotment under section 1359dd of this title, and each proportionate share established with respect to the allotment under section 1359ff(b) of this title, shall be increased or decreased by the same percentage that the allotment is increased or decreased.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a marketing allotment for a fiscal year is required to be reduced during the fiscal year under this subsection, if the quantity of sugar marketed, including sugar pledged as collateral for a price support loan under section 1446g&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1359cc_1_target" name="1359cc_1">1</a></sup> of this title, for the fiscal year at the time of the reduction by any individual processor covered by the allotment exceeds the processor's reduced allocation, the allocation of an allotment, if any, next established for the processor shall be reduced by the quantity of the excess sugar marketed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Filling cane sugar and beet sugar allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each marketing allotment for cane sugar established under this section may only be filled with sugar processed from domestically grown sugarcane, and each marketing allotment for beet sugar established under this section may only be filled with sugar processed from domestically grown sugar beets.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allocation to processors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever marketing allotments are established for a fiscal year under section 1359cc of this title, in order to afford all interested persons an equitable opportunity to market sugar under an allotment, the Secretary shall allocate each such allotment among the processors covered by the allotment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Hearing and notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Cane sugar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall make allocations for cane sugar after a hearing, if requested by interested parties, and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in such manner and in such quantities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of the allocations by taking into consideration processing capacity, past marketings of sugar, and the ability of each processor to market sugar covered by that portion of the allotment allocated. Each such allocation shall be subject to adjustment under section 1359cc(g) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Beet sugar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall make allocations for beet sugar after a hearing, if requested by interested parties, and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in such manner and in such quantities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of the allocations by taking into consideration processing capacity, past marketings of sugar (considering for the purposes the marketings of sugar processed from sugar beets of any or all of the 1985 through 1989 crops), and the ability of each processor to market sugar covered by that portion of the allotment allocated. Each such allocation shall be subject to adjustment under section 1359cc(g) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Filling cane sugar allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in section 1359ee of this title, a State cane sugar allotment established under section 1359cc(f) of this title for a fiscal year may be filled only with sugar processed from sugarcane grown in the State covered by the allotment.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Estimates of deficits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time allotments are in effect under this subpart, the Secretary, from time to time, shall determine whether (in view of then-current inventories of sugar, the estimated production of sugar and expected marketings, and other pertinent factors) any processor of sugarcane will be unable to market the sugar covered by <!-- PDFPage:598 -->the portion of the State cane sugar allotment allocated to the processor and whether any processor of sugar beets will be unable to market sugar covered by the portion of the beet sugar allotment allocated to the processor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reassignment of deficits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cane sugar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any sugarcane processor who has been allocated a share of a State cane sugar allotment will be unable to market the processor's allocation of the State's allotment for the fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary first shall reassign the estimated quantity of the deficit to the allocations for other processors within that State, depending on the capacity of each other processor to fill the portion of the deficit to be assigned to it and taking into account the interests of producers served by the processors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if after the reassignments the deficit cannot be completely eliminated, the Secretary shall reassign the estimated quantity of the deficit proportionately to the allotments for other cane sugar States, depending on the capacity of each other State to fill the portion of the deficit to be assigned to it, with the reassigned quantity to each State to be allocated among processors in that State in proportion to the allocations of the processors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if after the reassignments, the deficit cannot be completely eliminated, the Secretary shall reassign the remainder to imports.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1359ff. Provisions applicable to producers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Processor assurances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever allotments for a fiscal year are allocated to processors under section 1359dd of this title, the Secretary shall obtain from the processors such assurances as the Secretary considers adequate that the allocation will be shared among producers served by the processor in a fair and equitable manner that adequately reflects producers&rsquo; production histories. Any dispute between a processor and a producer, or group of producers, with respect to the sharing of the processor's allocation shall be resolved through arbitration by the Secretary on the request of either party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proportionate shares of certain allotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) States affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which a State allotment is established under section 1359cc(f) of this title and there are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in the State (other than Puerto Rico), the Secretary shall make a determination under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall determine, for each State allotment described in subparagraph (A), whether the production of sugarcane, in the absence of proportionate shares, will be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Establishment of proportionate shares</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that the quantity of sugarcane produced by producers in the area covered by a State allotment for a fiscal year will be in excess of the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment for the fiscal year and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar, the Secretary shall establish a proportionate share for each sugarcane-producing farm that limits the acreage of sugarcane that may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed during the fiscal year the allotment is in effect as provided in this subsection. Each such proportionate share shall be subject to adjustment under paragraph (7) and section 1359cc(g) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of determining</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining proportionate shares for any crop of sugarcane:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary shall establish the State's per-acre yield goal for a crop of sugarcane at a level (not less than the average per-acre yield in the State for the preceding 5 years, as determined by the Sec<!-- PDFPage:599 -->retary) that will ensure an adequate net return per pound to producers in the State, taking into consideration any available production research data that the Secretary considers relevant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Secretary shall adjust the per-acre yield goal by the average recovery rate of sugar produced from sugarcane by processors in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Secretary shall convert the State allotment for the fiscal year involved into a State acreage allotment for the crop by dividing the State allotment by the per-acre yield goal for the State, as established under subparagraph (A) and as further adjusted under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Secretary shall establish a uniform reduction percentage for the crop by dividing the State acreage allotment, as determined for the crop under subparagraph (C), by the sum of all adjusted acreage bases in the State, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The uniform reduction percentage for the crop, as determined under subparagraph (D), shall be applied to the acreage base for each sugarcane-producing farm in the State to determine the farm's proportionate share of sugarcane acreage that may be harvested for sugar or seed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Acreage base</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the acreage base for each sugarcane-producing farm shall be determined by the Secretary, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The acreage base for any farm shall be the number of acres that is equal to the average of the acreage planted and considered planted for harvest for sugar or seed on the farm in each of the 5 crop years preceding the fiscal year the proportionate share will be in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Acreage planted to sugarcane that producers on a farm were unable to harvest to sugarcane for sugar or seed because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers may be considered as harvested for the production of sugar or seed for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Violation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Whenever proportionate shares are in effect in a State for a crop of sugarcane, producers on a farm shall not knowingly harvest, or allow to be harvested, for sugar or seed an acreage of sugarcane in excess of the farm's proportionate share for the fiscal year, or otherwise violate proportionate share regulations issued by the Secretary under section 1359hh(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination of violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No producer shall be considered to have violated subparagraph (A) unless the processor of the sugarcane harvested by such producer from acreage in excess of the proportionate share of the farm markets an amount of sugar that exceeds the allocation of such processor for a fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any producer on a farm who violates subparagraph (A) by knowingly harvesting, or allowing to be harvested, an acreage of sugarcane in excess of the farm's proportionate share shall be liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty equal to one and one-half times the United States market value of the quantity of sugar that is marketed by the processor of such sugarcane in excess of the allocation of such processor for the fiscal year. The Secretary shall prorate penalties imposed under this subparagraph in a fair and equitable manner among all the producers of sugarcane harvested from excess acreage that is acquired by such processor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, the Secretary may authorize the county and State committees established under section 590h(b) of title 16 to waive or modify deadlines and other proportionate share requirements in cases in which lateness or failure to meet the other requirements does not affect adversely the operation of proportionate shares.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary determines that, because of a natural disaster or other condition beyond the control of producers that adversely affects a crop of sugarcane subject to proportionate shares, the amount of sugarcane produced by producers subject to the proportionate shares will not be sufficient to enable processors in the State to meet the State's cane sugar allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar, the Secretary may uniformly allow producers to harvest an amount of sugarcane in excess of their proportionate share, or suspend proportionate shares entirely, as necessary to enable processors to meet the State allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of establishing proportionate shares for sugarcane farms under section 1359ff of this title, the Secretary, on application of any producer, with the written consent of all owners of a farm, may transfer the acreage base history of the farm to any other parcels of land of the applicant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preservation of acreage base history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If for reasons beyond the control of a producer on a farm, the producer is unable to harvest an acreage of sugarcane for sugar or seed with respect to all or a portion of the proportionate share established for the farm under section 1359ff of this title, the Secretary, on the application of the producer and with the written consent of all owners of the farm, may preserve for a period of not more than 3 consecutive years the acreage base history of the farm to the extent of the proportionate share involved. The Secretary may permit the proportionate share to be redistributed to other farms, but no acreage base history for purposes of establishing acreage bases shall accrue to the other farms by virtue of the redistribution of the proportionate share.</p>
