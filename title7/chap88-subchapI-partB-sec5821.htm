<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to develop knowledge and information on integrated crop and livestock management systems and practices to assist agricultural producers in the adoption of these systems and practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to accumulate and analyze information on agricultural production practices researched or developed under programs established under this subchapter, chapter 86 of this title,<sup><a href="#5821_1_target" name="5821_1">1</a></sup> and other appropriate programs of the Department of Agriculture to further the development of integrated crop and livestock management systems;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) optimum use of available resources and improved production and financial efficiency for producers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) identifying and prioritizing the research and educational needs of the livestock industry relating to production and financial efficiency, competitiveness, environmental stability, and food safety; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1586 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) utilizing an interdisciplinary approach.</p>
