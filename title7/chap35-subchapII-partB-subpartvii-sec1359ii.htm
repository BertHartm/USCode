Unless a later date is specified by the Secretary as part of the Secretary's decision, the decision complained of shall be considered to be effective as of the date on which announcement of the decision is made. The Secretary shall deliver a copy of any notice of appeal to each person shown by the records of the Secretary to be adversely affected by reason of the decision appealed, and shall at all times thereafter permit any such person to inspect and make copies of appellant's reasons for the appeal and shall on application permit the person to intervene in the appeal.</p>

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall consider the appeal if the notice alleges that any processor that has a beet sugar allocation has failed to fill at least 82.5 percent of its allocation of the beet sugar allotment with sugar produced by it or received from the Commodity Credit Corporation in 2 out of the 3 crop years preceding the crop year in which the appeal is filed.
