<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the general welfare through the improved health and productivity of domestic livestock, poultry, aquatic animals, and other income-producing animals which are essential to the Nation's food supply and the welfare of producers and consumers of animal products; to improve the health of horses; to facilitate the effective treatment of, and, where possible, prevent, animal and poultry diseases in both domesticated and wild animals which, if not controlled, would be disastrous to the United States livestock and poultry industries and endanger the Nation's food supply; to minimize livestock and poultry losses due to transportation and handling; to protect human health through control of animal diseases transmissible to humans; to improve methods of controlling the births of predators and other animals; and otherwise to promote the general welfare through expanded programs of research and extension to improve animal health. It is recognized that the total animal health and disease research and extension efforts of the several State colleges and universities and of the Federal Government would be more effective if there were close coordination between such programs, and it is further recognized that colleges and universities having accredited schools or colleges of veterinary medicine and State agricultural experiment stations that conduct animal health and disease research are especially vital in training research workers in animal health.</p>
