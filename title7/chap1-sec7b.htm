<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">2008&mdash;Pub. L. 110&ndash;246, &sect;13203(<em>l</em>), inserted &ldquo;,&nbsp;or revocation of the right of an electronic trading facility to rely on the exemption set forth in section 2(h)(3) of this title with respect to a significant price discovery contract,&rdquo; after &ldquo;designation as a registered entity&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">2000&mdash;Pub. L. 106&ndash;554, &sect;1(a)(5) [title I, &sect;115], amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: &ldquo;The failure or refusal of any board of trade to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter, or any of the rules, regulations, or orders of the Commission or the commission thereunder, shall be cause for suspending for a period not to exceed six months or revoking the designation of such board of trade as a &lsquo;contract market&rsquo; in accordance with the procedure and subject to the judicial review provided in section 8(b) of this title.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">1992&mdash;Pub. L. 102&ndash;546 substituted reference to section 8(b) of this title for reference to section 8 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">1974&mdash;Pub. L. 93&ndash;463, &sect;103(a), provided for substitution of &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;Secretary of Agriculture&rdquo; except where such words would be stricken by section 103(b), which directed striking the words &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or&rdquo; where they appeared in the phrase &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commission&rdquo;. Because the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; was not capitalized in the text of this section, section 103(b) did not apply to this section and therefore section 103(a) was executed, resulting in the substitution of &ldquo;the Commission or the commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1968&mdash;Pub. L. 90&ndash;258 substituted &ldquo;rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture&rdquo;.</p>
