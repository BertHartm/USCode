<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">1992&mdash;Pub. L. 102&ndash;546 substituted reference to section 8(b) of this title for reference to section 8 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">1974&mdash;Pub. L. 93&ndash;463, &sect;103(a), provided for substitution of &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;Secretary of Agriculture&rdquo; except where such words would be stricken by section 103(b), which directed striking the words &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or&rdquo; where they appeared in the phrase &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commission&rdquo;. Because the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; was not capitalized in the text of this section, section 103(b) did not apply to this section and therefore section 103(a) was executed, resulting in the substitution of &ldquo;the Commission or the commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1968&mdash;Pub. L. 90&ndash;258 substituted &ldquo;rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture&rdquo;.</p>
