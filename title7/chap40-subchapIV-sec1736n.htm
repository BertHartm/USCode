<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1736n. Increased usage of protein byproducts derived from alcohol fuel production</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that the use of the protein byproduct resulting from the production of fuel al<!-- PDFPage:886 -->cohol from agricultural commodities may make it possible for the United States to make available significantly increased amounts of protein to meet the food needs of developing countries without any increase in handling, storage, and transportation facilities. It is the sense of Congress that serious consideration should be given to the potential of this protein byproduct and that, if found to be feasible, this protein byproduct should be included in the Department of Agriculture's commodity export and donation programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigative authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Accordingly, the Secretary of Agriculture shall continue to investigate the potential for using the protein byproduct resulting from the production of fuel alcohol from agricultural commodities in meeting the food needs of developing countries through food for peace programs carried out under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] and through the export credit sales program carried out under section 1707a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1736n_1_target" name="1736n_1">1</a></sup> of this title and section 714c(f) of title 15.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional investigative authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also continue to investigate the potential for using the protein byproduct resulting from the production of fuel alcohol from agricultural commodities in the distribution of food products under the commodity donation program carried out under clause (3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1736n_1_target" name="1736n_1">1</a></sup> of section 1431 of this title and under section 1859 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than twelve months after December 22, 1981, the Secretary shall include the results of the investigations referred to in subsections (b) and (c) of this section in an appropriate report to Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall thereafter provide to Congress each year a description of the efforts being made by the Department to make available, as part of the programs referred to in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the protein byproduct resulting from the production of fuel alcohol from agricultural commodities. The information for all such programs shall be included in the report submitted pursuant to section 407(g)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1736n_1_target" name="1736n_1">1</a></sup> of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1736a(g)], or in any other appropriate annual report to Congress.</p>
