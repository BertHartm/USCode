<p class="statutory-body">(1) Out of such sums each State shall be entitled to receive annually a sum of money equal to and subject to the same requirement as to use for marketing research projects as the sums received from Federal appropriations for State agricultural experiment stations for the fiscal year 1955, except that amounts heretofore made available from the fund known as the &ldquo;Regional research fund, Office of Experiment Stations&rdquo; shall continue to be available for the support of cooperative regional projects as defined in subsection (c)(3) of this section, and the said fund shall be designated &ldquo;Regional research fund, State agricultural experiment stations,&rdquo; and the Secretary of Agriculture shall be entitled to receive annually for the administration of sections 361a to 361i of this title, a sum not less than that available for this purpose for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955: <em>Provided,</em> That if the appropriations hereunder available for distribution in any fiscal year are less than those for the fiscal year 1955 the allotment to each State and the amounts for Federal administration and the regional research fund shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of such reduction.</p>
