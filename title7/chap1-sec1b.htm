<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Required considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether to exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of the term &ldquo;swap&rdquo;, the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether the required trading and clearing of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards would create systemic risk, lower transparency, or threaten the financial stability of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards are already subject to a regulatory scheme that is materially comparable to that established by this chapter for other classes of swaps;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which bank regulators of participants in the foreign exchange market provide adequate supervision, including capital and margin requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent of adequate payment and settlement systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the use of a potential exemption of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards to evade otherwise applicable regulatory requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary makes a determination to exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of the term &ldquo;swap&rdquo;, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a determination that contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an explanation regarding why foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards are qualitatively different from other classes of swaps in a way that would make the foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards ill-suited for regulation as swaps; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an identification of the objective differences of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards with respect to standard swaps that warrant an exempted status.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effect of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A determination by the Secretary under subsection (b) shall not exempt any foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility from any applicable antifraud and antimanipulation provision under this chapter.<sup><a href="#1b_1_target" name="1b_1">1</a></sup></p>
