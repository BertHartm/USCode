<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is to improve compliance with, and the integrity of, the Federal crop insurance program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Role of insurance providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall work actively with approved insurance providers to address program compliance and integrity issues as such issues develop.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification of compliance problems</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notification of errors, omissions, and failures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall notify in writing an approved insurance provider of any error, omission, or failure to follow Corporation regulations or procedures for which the approved insurance provider may be responsible and which may result in a debt owed the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time for notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notice under paragraph (1) shall be given within 3 years after the end of the insurance period during which the error, omission, or failure is alleged to have occurred, except that this time limitation shall not apply with respect to an error, omission, or procedural violation that is willful or intentional.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of failure to timely notify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the failure to timely provide the notice required under this subsection shall relieve the approved insurance provider from the debt owed the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reconciling producer information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop and implement a coordinated plan for the Corporation and the Farm Service Agency to reconcile all relevant information received by the Corporation or the Farm Service Agency from a producer who obtains crop insurance coverage under this subchapter. Beginning with the 2001 crop year, the Secretary shall require that the Corporation and the Farm Service Agency reconcile such producer-derived information on at least an annual basis in order to identify and address any discrepancies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Identification and elimination of fraud, waste, and abuse</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) FSA monitoring program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall develop and implement a coordinated plan for the Farm Service Agency to assist the Corporation in the ongoing monitoring of programs carried out under this subchapter, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at the request of the Corporation or, subject to paragraph (2), on its own initiative if the Farm Service Agency has reason to suspect the existence of program fraud, waste, or abuse, conducting fact finding relative to allegations of program fraud, waste, or abuse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reporting to the Corporation, in writing in a timely manner, the results of any fact finding conducted pursuant to subparagraph (A), any allegation of fraud, waste, or abuse, and any identified program vulnerabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) assisting the Corporation and approved insurance providers in auditing a statistically appropriate number of claims made under any policy or plan of insurance under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) FSA inquiry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, within five calendar days after receiving a report submitted under paragraph (1)(B), the Corporation does not provide a written response that describes the intended actions of the Corporation, the Farm Service Agency may conduct its own inquiry into the alleged program fraud, waste, or abuse on approval from the State director of the Farm Service Agency of the State in which the alleged fraud, waste, or abuse occurred. If as a result of the inquiry, the Farm Service Agency concludes further investigation is warranted, but the Corporation declines to proceed with the investigation, the Farm Service Agency may refer the matter to the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of field infrastructure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The plan required by paragraph (1) shall provide for the use of the field infrastructure of the Farm Service Agency. The Secretary shall ensure that relevant Farm Service Agency personnel are appropriately trained for any responsibilities assigned to the personnel under the plan. At a minimum, the personnel shall receive the same level of training and pass the <!-- PDFPage:793 -->same basic competency tests as required of loss adjusters of approved insurance providers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Maintenance of provider effort</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The activities of the Farm Service Agency under this subsection do not affect the responsibility of approved insurance providers to conduct any audits of claims or other program reviews required by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notification of providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation shall notify the appropriate approved insurance provider of a report from the Farm Service Agency regarding alleged program fraud, waste, or abuse, unless the provider is suspected to be included in, or a party to, the alleged fraud, waste, or abuse.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Response</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An approved insurance provider that receives a notice under subparagraph (B) shall submit a report to the Corporation, within an appropriate time period determined by the Secretary, describing the actions taken by the provider to investigate the allegations of program fraud, waste, or abuse contained in the notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Corporation response to provider reports</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Prompt response</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an approved insurance provider reports to the Corporation that the approved insurance provider suspects intentional misrepresentation, fraud, waste, or abuse, the Corporation shall make a determination and provide, within 90 calendar days after receiving the report, a written response that describes the intended actions of the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cooperative effort</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The approved insurance provider and the Corporation shall take coordinated action in any case where misrepresentation, fraud, waste, or abuse is alleged.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Failure to timely respond</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any person performing loss adjustment services relative to coverage offered under this subchapter where such loss adjustments performed by the person result in accepted or denied claims equal to or greater than 150 percent (or an appropriate percentage specified by the Corporation) of the mean for accepted or denied claims (as applicable) for all other persons performing loss adjustment services in the same area, as determined by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Review</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Review required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation shall conduct a review of any agent identified pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), and any person identified pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), to determine whether the higher loss claims associated with the agent or the higher number of accepted or denied claims (as applicable) associated with the person are the result of fraud, waste, or abuse.</p>
