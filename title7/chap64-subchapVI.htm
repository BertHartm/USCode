<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation and distribution of appropriated funds</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1277 --><p class="statutory-body-block">In computing the distribution of funds allocated under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the allotments to Tuskegee Institute and Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University shall be determined as if each institution were in a separate State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The State director of the cooperative extension service and the extension administrator at the eligible institution in each State where an eligible institution is located shall jointly develop, by mutual agreement, a comprehensive program of extension for such State to be submitted for approval by the Secretary within one year after September 29, 1977 and each five years thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of funds to eligible institutions</h4>

Before the funds herein provided shall become available to any eligible institution for any fiscal year, plans for the work to be carried out under this section shall be submitted, as part of the State plan of work, and approved by the Secretary. Such sums shall be paid in equal quarterly payments on or about October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1 of each year to the treasurer or other officer of the eligible institution duly authorized to receive such payments and such officer shall be required to report to the Secretary on or about the first day of December of each year a detailed statement of the amount so received during the previous fiscal year and its disbursement, on forms prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

No portion of such moneys shall be applied, directly or indirectly, to the purchase, erection, preservation, or repair of any building or buildings, or the purchase or rental of land, or in college course teaching, lectures in college, or any other purpose not specified in this section. It shall be the duty of such institution, annually, on or about the first day of January, to make to the Governor of the State in which it is located a full and detailed report of its operations in extension work, including a detailed statement of receipts and expenditures from all sources for this purpose, a copy of which report shall be sent to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Secretary's finding of non-entitlement to appropriated funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary finds that an eligible institution is not entitled to receive its share of the annual appropriation, the facts and reasons therefor shall be reported to the President, and the amount involved shall be kept separate in the Treasury until the expiration of the next Congress in order that the institution may, if it should so desire, appeal to Congress from the determination of the Secretary. If the next Congress does not direct such sum to be paid, it shall be carried to surplus.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mailing of correspondence, bulletins, and reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent that the official mail consists of correspondence, bulletins, and reports for furtherance of the purposes of this section, it shall be transmitted in the mails of the United States under penalty indicia: <em>Provided,</em> That each item shall bear such indicia as are prescribed by the Postmaster General and shall be mailed under such regulations as the Postmaster General may from time to time prescribe.
