(Sections 321, 322, 324, and 325a of title 40 shall not apply to any nursery, planting, cultivating or harvesting operations conducted pursuant to sections 171 to 173 of this title.)

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary may delegate any of the powers and duties conferred on him by sections 171 to 173 of this title to any agency or bureau of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary, with the consent of any board, commission, independent establishment, corporation, or executive department of the Government, including any field service thereof, may avail himself of the use of information, services, facilities, officers and employees thereof, in carrying out the provisions of sections 171 to 173 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary may allot to bureaus and offices of the Department of Agriculture, or may transfer to such other agencies of the State and Federal Governments as may be requested by him to assist in carrying out sections 171 to 173 of this title, any funds made available to him under said sections.</p>

<p class="note-body">The civil service laws, referred to in subsec. (a), are set forth in Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. See, particularly, section 3301 et seq. of Title 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 321, 322, 324, and 325a of title 40, referred to in subsec. (a), were repealed by Pub. L. 87&ndash;581, title II, &sect;203, Aug. 13, 1962, 76 Stat. 360. See sections 328, 330, and 332 of Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">In the second sentence of subsec. (a), the words &ldquo;and the compensation of the persons so appointed may be fixed without regard to the provisions of the Classification Act of 1923, as amended&rdquo; were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this subsection because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act of any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Act Sept. 6, 1966, Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;8(a), 80 Stat. 632 (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5, U.S.C., into law). Section 5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.</p>
