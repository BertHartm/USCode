<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Transfers of certificates; purchases by Commodity Credit Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Marketing certificates shall be transferable only in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Any unused certificates legally held by any person shall be purchased by Commodity Credit Corporation if tendered to the Corporation for purchase in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Processor and exporter acquisition of domestic and export certificates; international trade, expansion; refunds or credits for certificates; exemptions from requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During any marketing year for which a wheat marketing allocation program is in effect, (i) all persons engaged in the processing of wheat into food products shall, prior to marketing any such food product or removing such food product for sale or consumption, acquire domestic marketing certificates equivalent to the number of bushels of wheat contained in such product and (ii) all persons exporting wheat shall, prior to such export, acquire export marketing certificates equivalent to the number of bushels so exported. The cost of the export marketing certificates per bushel to the exporter shall be that amount determined by the Secretary on a daily basis which would make United States wheat and wheat flour generally competitive in the world market, avoid disruption of world market prices, and fulfill the international obligations of the United States. The Secretary may exempt from the requirements of this subsection wheat exported for donation abroad and other noncommercial exports of wheat, wheat processed for use on the farm where grown, wheat produced by a State or agency thereof and processed for use by the State or agency thereof, wheat processed for donation, and wheat processed for uses determined by the Secretary to be noncommercial. Such exemptions may be made applicable with respect to any wheat processed or exported beginning July 1, 1964. There shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection beverage distilled from wheat prior to July 1, 1964. A beverage distilled from wheat after July 1, 1964, shall be deemed to be removed for sale or consumption at the time it is placed in barrels for aging except that upon the giving of a bond as prescribed by the Secretary, the purchase of and payment for such marketing certificates as may be required may be deferred until such beverage is bottled for sale. Wheat shipped to a Canadian port for storage in bond, or storage under a similar arrangement, and subsequent exportation, shall be deemed to have been exported for purposes of this subsection when it is exported from the Canadian port. Marketing certificates shall be valid to cover only sales or removals for sale or consumption or exportations made during the marketing year with respect to which they are issued, and after being once used to cover a sale or removal for sale or consumption or export of a food product or an export of wheat shall be void and shall be disposed of in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, the Secretary may require marketing certificates issued for any marketing year to be acquired to cover sales, removals, or exportations made on or after the date during the calendar year in which wheat harvested in such calendar year begins to be marketed as determined by the Secretary even though such wheat is marketed prior to the beginning of the marketing year, and marketing certificates for such marketing year shall be valid to cover sales, removals, or exportations made on or after the date so determined by the Secretary. Whenever the face value per bushel of domestic marketing certificates for a marketing year is different from the face value of domestic marketing certificates for the preceding marketing year, the Secretary may require marketing certificates issued for the preceding marketing year to be acquired to cover all wheat processed into food products during such preceding marketing year even though the food product may be marketed or removed for sale or consumption after the end of the marketing year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:616 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Undertaking to secure marketing of commodity without certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the giving of a bond or other undertaking satisfactory to the Secretary to secure the purchase of and payment for such marketing certificates as may be required, and subject to such regulations as he may prescribe, any person required to have marketing certificates in order to market or export a commodity may be permitted to market any such commodity without having first acquired marketing certificates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Food products&rdquo; defined; exemption of flour second clears</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this part, the term &ldquo;food products&rdquo; means flour (excluding flour second clears not used for human consumption as determined by the Secretary), semolina, farina, bulgur, beverage, and any other product composed wholly or partly of wheat which the Secretary may determine to be a food product. The Secretary may at his election administer the exemption for wheat processed into flour second clears through refunds either to processors of such wheat or to the users of such clears. For the purpose of such refunds, the wheat equivalent of flour second clears may be determined on the basis of conversion factors authorized by section 1379f of this title, even though certificates had been surrendered on the basis of the weight of the wheat.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 88&ndash;297, &sect;202(16), in cl.
