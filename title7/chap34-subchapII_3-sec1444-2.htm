<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary shall, on presentation of warehouse receipts or other acceptable evidence of title, as determined by the Secretary, reflecting accrued storage charges of not more than 60 days, make available for the 1991 through 1997 crops of upland cotton to producers on a farm nonrecourse loans for upland cotton produced on the farm for a term of 10 months from the first day of the month in which the loan is made at such loan level, per pound, as will reflect for the base quality of upland cotton, as determined by the Secretary, at average location in the United States a level that is not less than the smaller of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 85 percent of the average price (weighted by market and month) of the base quality of cotton as quoted in the designated United States spot markets during 3 years of the 5-year period ending July 31 in the year in which the loan level is announced, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in the period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 90 percent of the average, for the 15-week period beginning July 1 of the year in which the loan level is announced, of the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-seconds inch cotton C.I.F. Northern Europe (adjusted downward by the average difference during the period April 15 through October 15 of the year in which the loan is announced between the average Northern European price quotation of such quality of cotton and the market quotations in the designated United States spot markets for the base quality of upland cotton), as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments to loan level</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limitation on decrease in loan level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The loan level for any crop determined under paragraph (1) may not be reduced by more than 5 percent from the level determined for the preceding crop, and may not be reduced below 50 cents per pound.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation on increase in loan level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for any crop the average Northern European price determined under paragraph (1)(B) is less than the average United States spot market price determined under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary may increase the loan level to such level as the Secretary may consider appropriate, not in excess of the average United States spot market price determined under paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Announcement of loan level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan level for any crop of upland cotton shall be determined and announced by the Secretary not later than November 1 of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which the loan is to be effective or, in the case of the 1991 crop, as soon as is practicable after November 28, 1990. The loan level shall not thereafter be changed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Extension of loan period</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), nonrecourse loans provided for in this section shall, on request of the producer during the 10th month of the loan period for the cotton, be made available for an additional term of 8 months.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A request to extend the loan period shall not be approved in any month in which the average price of the base quality of upland cotton, as determined by the Secretary, in the designated spot markets for the preceding month exceeded 130 percent of the average price of such base quality of cotton in the designated United States spot markets for the preceding 36-month period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Marketing loan provisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines that the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location) is below the loan level determined under the foregoing provisions of this subsection, in order to make United States upland cotton competitive in world markets, the Secretary shall permit a producer to repay a loan made for any crop at&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a level that is the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the loan level determined for the crop; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) the loan level determined for the crop multiplied by 70 percent; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:677 --><p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such other level (not in excess of the loan level determined for the crop nor less than 70 percent of such loan level) that the Secretary determines will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) minimize potential loan forfeitures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) minimize the accumulation of cotton stocks by the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing cotton; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) First handler marketing certificates</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">During the period beginning August 1, 1991, and ending July 31, 1998, if a program carried out under subparagraph (A) or subsection (b) of this section fails to make United States upland cotton fully competitive in world markets and the prevailing world market price of upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary, is below the current loan repayment rate for upland cotton determined under subparagraph (A), to make United States upland cotton competitive in world markets and to maintain and expand domestic consumption and exports of upland cotton produced in the United States, the Secretary shall provide for the issuance of marketing certificates or cash payments in accordance with this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commodity Credit Corporation, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, shall make payments, through the issuance of marketing certificates or cash payments, to first handlers of cotton (persons regularly engaged in buying or selling upland cotton) who have entered into an agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation to participate in the program established under this subparagraph. The payments shall be made in such monetary amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines will make upland cotton produced in the United States available at competitive prices, consistent with the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The value of each certificate or cash payment issued under clause (ii) shall be based on the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the loan repayment rate for upland cotton; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the prevailing world market price of upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Redemption, marketing, or exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commodity Credit Corporation, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, may assist any person receiving marketing certificates under this subparagraph in the redemption of certificates for cash, or marketing or exchange of the certificates for agricultural commodities or products owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation, at such times, in such manner, and at such price levels as the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the program established under this subparagraph. Any price restrictions that may otherwise apply to the disposition of agricultural commodities by the Commodity Credit Corporation shall not apply to the redemption of certificates under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Designation of commodities and products; charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Insofar as practicable, the Secretary shall permit owners of certificates to designate the commodities and the products thereof, including storage sites thereof, the owners would prefer to receive in exchange for certificates. If any certificate is not presented for redemption, marketing, or exchange within a reasonable number of days after the issuance of the certificate (as determined by the Secretary), reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges, as determined by the Secretary, shall be deducted from the value of the certificate for the period beginning after the reasonable number of days and ending with the date of the presentation of the certificate to the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Displacement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall take such measures as may be necessary to prevent the marketing or exchange of agricultural commodities and products for certificates under this subsection from adversely affecting the income of producers of the commodities or products.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, certificates issued to cotton handlers under this subparagraph may be transferred to other handlers and persons approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prevailing world market price</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a formula to define the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a mechanism by which the Secretary shall announce periodically the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location) established under <!-- PDFPage:678 -->this subparagraph shall be used under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (E).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">During the period beginning August 1, 1991, and ending July 31, 1998, the prevailing world market price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location) established under subparagraph (C) shall be further adjusted if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the adjusted prevailing world market price is less than 115 percent of the current crop year loan level for the base quality of upland cotton, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the Friday through Thursday average price quotation for the lowest-priced United States growth as quoted for Middling (M) one and three-thirty seconds inch cotton delivered C.I.F. Northern Europe is greater than the Friday through Thursday average price of the five lowest-priced growths of upland cotton, as quoted for Middling (M) one and three-thirty seconds inch cotton, delivered C.I.F. Northern Europe (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;Northern Europe price&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Further adjustment</h4>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) 1991 through 1993 crops</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of each of the 1991 through 1993 crops of upland cotton, if an acreage limitation program under subsection (e) of this section is in effect for any crop of upland cotton and if the Secretary determines that producers on a farm are prevented from planting the acreage intended for upland cotton to upland cotton because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers, the Secretary shall make available to such producers payments under this subparagraph without regard to the requirement imposed under clause (ii). To be eligible for payments under this clause, the producers must devote the acreage to conservation uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E)).
