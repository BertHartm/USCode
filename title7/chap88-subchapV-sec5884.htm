<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a research and education program to study the biology and behavior of chinch bugs. The purpose of this study shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to characterize the relationship between environmental and climatic factors and chinch bug outbreaks in an attempt to predict when these outbreaks occur;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to determine chinch bug dispersal habits, overwintering habitat preferences, and overwintering survival in native and introduced grasses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to describe the population dynamics of chinch bugs in small grain and noncrop grass hosts in the spring and assess yield losses in small grain crop hosts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to investigate various aspects of chinch bug behavior (including host habitat preferences, oviposition, and pheromones) that may result in the development of novel management strategies.</p>
