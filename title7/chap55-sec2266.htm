<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2266. Congressional reaffirmation of policy to foster and encourage family farms</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Congress reaffirms the historical policy of the United States to foster and encourage the family farm system of agriculture in this country. Congress believes that the maintenance of the family farm system of agriculture is essential to the social well-being of the Nation and the competitive production of adequate supplies of food and fiber. Congress further believes that any significant expansion of nonfamily owned large-scale corporate farming enterprises will be detrimental to the national welfare. It is neither the policy nor the intent of Congress that agricultural and agriculture-related programs be administered exclusively for family farm operations, but it is the policy and the express intent of Congress that no such program be administered in a manner that will place the family farm operation at an unfair economic disadvantage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Omitted</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 103 of Pub.

The Secretary <!-- PDFPage:1274 -->was authorized to collect such other information as necessary to determine the impact of such a statutory provision and to identify the number and characteristics of producers that would be affected by such a provision.</p>
