<p class="statutory-body">The importation or distribution in interstate commerce of noxious weeds, except under controlled conditions, allows the growth and spread of such weeds which interfere with the growth of useful plants, clog waterways and interfere with navigation, cause disease, or have other adverse effects upon man or his environment and therefore is detrimental to the agriculture and commerce of the United States and to the public health. The uncontrolled distribution within the United States of noxious weeds after their importation or interstate distribution has like detrimental effects and allowing such distribution encourages and facilitates the burdening and obstructing of interstate and foreign commerce, and is inimical to the public interest. Accordingly, the Congress hereby determines that the regulation of transactions in, and movement of, noxious weeds as provided in this chapter is necessary to prevent and eliminate burdens upon and obstructions to interstate and foreign commerce and to protect the public welfare.</p>
