<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1926. Water and waste facility loans and grants</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is also authorized to make or insure loans to associations, including corporations not operated for profit, Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other federally recognized Indian tribes, and public and quasi-public agencies to provide for the application or establishment of soil conservation practices, shifts in land use, the conservation, development, use, and control of water, and the installation or improvement of drainage or waste disposal facilities, recreational developments, and essential community facilities including necessary related equipment, all primarily serving farmers, ranchers, farm tenants, farm laborers, rural businesses, and other rural residents, and to furnish financial assistance or other aid in planning projects for such purposes. The Secretary may also make loans to any borrower to whom a loan has been made under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.), for the conservation, development, use, and control of water, and the installation of drainage or waste disposal facilities, primarily serving farmers, ranchers, farm tenants, farm laborers, rural businesses, and other rural residents. When any loan made for a purpose specified in this paragraph is sold out of the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund as an insured loan, the interest or other income thereon paid to an insured holder shall be included in gross income for purposes of chapter 1 of title 26. With respect to loans of less than $500,000 made or insured under this paragraph that are evidenced by notes and mortgages, as distinguished from bond issues, borrowers shall not be required to appoint bond counsel to review the legal validity of the loan whenever the Secretary has available legal counsel to perform such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to make grants aggregating not to exceed $590,000,000 in any fiscal year to such associations to finance specific projects for works for the development, storage, treatment, purification, or distribution of water or the collection, treatment, or disposal of waste in rural areas. The amount of any grant made under the authority of this paragraph shall not exceed 75 per centum of the development cost of the project to serve the area which the association determines can be feasibly served by the facility and to adequately serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area. The Secretary shall fix the grant rate for each project in conformity with regulations issued by the Secretary that shall provide for a graduated scale of grant rates establishing higher rates for projects in communities that have lower community population and income levels.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:915 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) No grant shall be made under paragraph (2) of this subsection in connection with any project unless the Secretary determines that the project (i) will serve a rural area which, if such project is carried out, is not likely to decline in population below that for which the project was designed, (ii) is designed and constructed so that adequate capacity will or can be made available to serve the present population of the area to the extent feasible and to serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area, and (iii) is necessary for an orderly community development consistent with a comprehensive community water, waste disposal, or other development plan of the rural area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The term &ldquo;development cost&rdquo; means the cost of construction of a facility and the land, easements, and rights-of-way, and water rights necessary to the construction and operation of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The term &ldquo;project&rdquo; shall include facilities providing central service or facilities serving individual properties, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Application requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not earlier than 60 days before a preliminary application is filed for a loan under paragraph (1) or a grant under paragraph (2) for a water or waste disposal purpose, a notice of the intent of the applicant to apply for the loan or grant shall be published in a general circulation newspaper. The selection of engineers for a project design shall be done by a request for proposals by the applicant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary may make grants aggregating not to exceed $30,000,000 in any fiscal year to public bodies or such other agencies as the Secretary may determine having authority to prepare comprehensive plans for the development of water or waste disposal systems in rural areas which do not have funds available for immediate undertaking of the preparation of such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Definition of rural and rural areas</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purpose of water and waste disposal grants and direct and guaranteed loans provided under paragraphs (1) and (2), the terms &ldquo;rural&rdquo; and &ldquo;rural area&rdquo; mean a city, town, or unincorporated area that has a population of no more than 10,000 inhabitants.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposits of funds; investments; purchase of notes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund or invested in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States.

Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current <!-- PDFPage:928 -->average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this subchapter. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary.

All net proceeds from such collections, including sales of notes or property, shall be deposited in and become a part of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit in fund of portion of charge on outstanding principal obligations; availability of remainder of charge, and merger with appropriations, for administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall deposit in the fund all or a portion, not to exceed one-half of 1 per centum of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, of any charge collected in connection with the insurance of loans; and any remainder of any such charge shall be available for administrative expenses of the Farmers Home Administration and the Rural Development Administration, in proportion to such charges collected in connection with the insurance of loans by such agency, to be transferred annually and become merged with any appropriation for administrative expenses for such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Utilization of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may utilize the fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay amounts to which the holder of the note is entitled on loans heretofore or hereafter insured accruing between the date of any payments made by the borrower and the date of transmittal of any such payments to the lender.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay to the holder of the notes any deferred or defaulted installment or, upon assignment of the note to the Secretary at the Secretary's request, the entire balance due on the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to purchase notes in accordance with agreements previously entered into;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to pay for contract services, taxes, insurance, prior liens, expenses necessary to make fiscal adjustments in connection with the application and transmittal of collections and other expenses and advances authorized in connection with insured loans, including the difference between interest payable by borrowers and interest to which insured lenders or insured holders are entitled under agreements with the Secretary included in contracts of insurance;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transfer of funds from Farmers Home Administration direct loan account and Emergency Credit Revolving Fund; abolition of such account and fund; payments from Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The assets and liabilities of, and authorizations applicable to, the Farmers Home Administration direct loan account created by section 1988(c) of this title (before the amendment made by section 749(a)(1) of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996) and the Emergency Credit Revolving Fund referred to in section 1966 of this title are hereby transferred to the fund, and such account and such revolving fund are hereby abolished. Such assets and their proceeds, including loans made out of the fund pursuant to this section, shall be subject to the provisions of this section, the last sentence of section 1926(a)(1), and the last sentence of section 1927 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) From time to time, and at least at the close of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay from the fund into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts interest on the value as determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Comptroller General, of the Government's equity transferred to the fund pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection plus the cumulative amount of appropriations made available after enactment of this provision as capital and for administration of the programs financed from the fund, less the average undisbursed cash balance in the fund during the year. The rate of such interest shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of loans made or insured from the fund, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. Interest payments may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, but any interest payments so deferred shall themselves bear interest. If at any time the Secretary determines that moneys in the fund exceed present and any reasonably prospective future requirements of the fund, such excess may be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maximum amount of loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not make a loan under this subchapter to a borrower who has suffered a loss in an amount that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:952 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) exceeds the actual loss caused by a disaster; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) would cause the total indebtedness of the borrower under this subchapter to exceed $500,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Interest rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans under this subchapter shall be at rates of interest as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) For loans or portions of loans up to the amount of the applicant's actual loss caused by the disaster, as limited under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the interest shall be at rates prescribed by the Secretary, but not in excess of 8 percent per annum; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For loans or portions of loans in excess of the amount of the applicant's actual loss caused by the disaster, as limited under subsection (a)(1) of this section, (A) the interest for insured loans shall be at rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans, as determined by the Secretary, and (B) the interest for guaranteed loans shall be at rates agreed on by the borrower and lender, but not in excess of such rates as may be determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For guaranteed loans under this subchapter, the Secretary may pay interest subsidies to the lenders for those portions of the loans up to the amount of the actual loss caused by the disaster, as limited under subsection (a)(1) of this section. Any such subsidy shall not exceed the difference between the interest rate being charged for loans up to the amount of the actual loss, as established under subsection (b)(1) of this section, and the maximum interest rate for guaranteed loans, as established under subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repayment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All loans under this subchapter shall be repayable at such times as the Secretary may determine, taking into account the purposes of the loan and the nature and effect of the disaster, but not later than as provided for loans for similar purposes under subchapters I and II of this chapter, and upon the full personal liability of the borrower and upon the best security available, as the Secretary may prescribe: <em>Provided</em>, That the security is adequate to assure repayment of the loans, except that if such security is not available because of the disaster, the Secretary shall (1) accept as security such collateral as is available, a portion or all of which may have depreciated in value due to the disaster and which in the opinion of the Secretary, together with the Secretary's confidence in the repayment ability of the applicant, is adequate security for the loan, and (2) make such loan repayable at such times as the Secretary may determine, not later than as provided under subchapters I and II of this chapter, as justified by the needs of the applicant: <em>Provided further</em>, That for any disaster occurring after January 1, 1975, the Secretary, if the loan is for a purpose described in subchapter II of the chapter, may make the loan repayable at the end of a period of more than seven years, but not more than twenty years, if the Secretary determines that the need of the loan applicant justifies such a longer repayment period: <em>Provided further</em>, That for any direct or insured loan (other than a guaranteed loan) approved under section 1961(b) of this title, three years after the loan is made or insured, and every two years thereafter for the term of the loan, the Secretary shall review the loan; and if, based on such review, the Secretary determines that the borrower is able to obtain a loan from non-Federal sources at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, the borrower shall on request by the Secretary, apply for and accept such non-Federal loan in sufficient amount to repay the Secretary. If farm assets (including land, livestock, and equipment) are used as collateral to secure a loan made under this subchapter, the Secretary shall establish the value of the assets as of the day before the occurrence of the natural disaster, major disaster, or emergency that is the basis for a request for assistance under this subchapter or the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No basis for denial of loan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall not deny a loan under this subchapter to a borrower by reason of the fact that the borrower lacks a particular amount of collateral for the loan if the Secretary is reasonably certain that the borrower will be able to repay the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Refusal to pledge available collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may deny or cancel a loan under this subchapter if a borrower refuses to pledge available collateral on request by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Grant eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any political subdivision of a State with a population of less than ten thousand inhabitants that, if such subdivision had a population of ten thousand or more inhabitants, would be eligible for a grant under the first title of the Community Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1977 shall be eligible for a grant under this chapter during any period in which the Community Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1977 is or has been in effect.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as the Congress may from time to time determine to be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this chapter and for the administration of assets transferred to the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sale by lender and any holder of guaranteed portion of loan pursuant to regulations governing such sales; limitations; issuance of pool certificates representing ownership of guaranteed portion of guaranteed loan; terms and conditions, etc.; reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The guaranteed portion of any loan made under this chapter may be sold by the lender, and by any subsequent holder, in accordance with regulations governing such sales as the Secretary shall establish, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) All fees due the Secretary with respect to a guaranteed loan are to be paid in full before any sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The loan is to have been fully disbursed to the borrower before the sale.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After a loan is sold in the secondary market, the lender shall remain obligated under its guarantee agreement with the Secretary, and shall continue to service the loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for determining the increase of farmers&rsquo; access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This subsection shall not be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made under this chapter, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may, directly or through a market maker approved by the Secretary, issue pool certificates representing ownership of part or all of the guaranteed portion of any loan guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter. Such certificates shall be based on and backed by a pool established or approved by the Secretary and composed solely of the entire guaranteed portion of such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, guarantee the timely payment of the principal and interest on pool certificates issued on behalf of the Secretary by approved market makers for purposes of this subsection. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans that compose the pool. If a loan in such pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or by reason of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the pool certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Secretary only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the pool certificate, the certificate may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts that may be required to be paid under any guarantee of such pool certificates issued by approved market makers under this subsection. The Secretary may expend amounts in the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund to make payments on such guarantees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall not collect any fee for any guarantee under this subsection. The preceding sentence shall not preclude the Secretary from collecting a fee for the functions described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Within 30 days after a borrower of a guaranteed loan is in default of any principal or interest payment due for 60 days or more, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) purchase the pool certificates representing ownership of the guaranteed portion of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) pay the registered holder of the certificates an amount equal to the guaranteed portion of the loan represented by the certificate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) If the Secretary pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, the claim shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment, as may be provided by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Secretary of the Secretary's ownership rights in the <!-- PDFPage:976 -->portions of loans constituting the pool against which the certificates are issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the adoption of final rules and regulations, the Secretary shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Provide for the central collection of registration information from all participating market makers for all loans and pool certificates sold under paragraphs (1) and (2). Such information shall include, with respect to each original sale and any subsequent sale, identification of the interest rate paid by the borrower to the lender, the lender's servicing fee, whether interest on the loan is at a fixed or variable rate, identification of each purchaser of a pool certificate, the interest rate paid on the certificate, and such other information as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before any sale, require the seller to disclose to each prospective purchaser of the portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to each prospective purchaser of a pool certificate issued under paragraph (2), information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this subparagraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term &ldquo;seller&rdquo; does not include (i) the person who made the loan or (ii) any person who sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Provide for adequate custody of any pooled guaranteed loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Take such actions as are necessary, in restructuring pools of the guaranteed portion of loans, to minimize the estimated costs of paying claims under guarantees issued under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Require each market maker&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to service all pools formed, and participations sold, by the market maker; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to provide the Secretary with information relating to the collection and disbursement of all periodic payments, prepayments, and default funds from lenders, to or from the reserve fund that the Secretary shall establish to enable the timely payment guarantee to be self-funding, and from all beneficial holders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Regulate market makers in pool certificates sold under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may contract for goods and services to be used for the purposes of this subsection without regard to the provisions of titles 5, 40, and 41, and any regulations issued thereunder.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2001. Debt restructuring and loan servicing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall modify delinquent farmer program loans made or insured under this chapter, or purchased from the lender or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 1929b of this title, to the maximum extent possible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to avoid losses to the Secretary on such loans, with priority consideration being placed on writing-down the loan principal and interest (subject to subsections (d) and (e) of this section), and debt set-aside (subject to sub<!-- PDFPage:990 -->section (e) of this section), whenever these procedures would facilitate keeping the borrower on the farm or ranch, or otherwise through the use of primary loan service programs as provided in this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure that borrowers are able to continue farming or ranching operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to obtain assistance under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the delinquency must be due to circumstances beyond the control of the borrower, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary, except that the regulations shall require that, if the value of the assets calculated under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section that may be realized through liquidation or other methods would produce enough income to make the delinquent loan current, the borrower shall not be eligible for assistance under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower must have acted in good faith with the Secretary in connection with the loan as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the borrower must present a preliminary plan to the Secretary that contains reasonable assumptions that demonstrate that the borrower will be able to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) meet the necessary family living and farm operating expenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) service all debts, including those of the loans restructured; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the loan, if restructured, must result in a net recovery to the Federal Government, during the term of the loan as restructured, that would be more than or equal to the net recovery to the Federal Government from an involuntary liquidation or foreclosure on the property securing the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restructuring determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of net recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the net recovery from the involuntary liquidation of a loan under this section, the Secretary shall calculate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan, in accordance with paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of the restructured loan, in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recovery value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of paragraph (1), the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the amount of the current appraised value of the interests of the borrower in the property securing the loan; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the value of the interests of the borrower in all other assets that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) not essential for necessary family living expenses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) not essential to the operation of the farm; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) not exempt from judgment creditors or in a bankruptcy action under Federal or State law; less</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the estimated administrative, legal, and other expenses associated with the liquidation and disposition of the loan and collateral, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the payment of prior liens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) taxes and assessments, depreciation, management costs, the yearly percentage decrease or increase in the value of the property, and lost interest income, each calculated for the average holding period for the type of property involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) resale expenses, such as repairs, commissions, and advertising; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) other administrative and attorney's costs; plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the value, as determined by the Secretary, of any property not included in subparagraph (A)(i) if the property is specified in any security agreement with respect to such loan and the Secretary determines that the value of such property should be included for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Value of the restructured loan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of paragraph (1), the value of the restructured loan shall be based on the present value of payments that the borrower would make to the Federal Government if the terms of such loan were modified under any combination of primary loan service programs to ensure that the borrower is able to meet such obligations and continue farming operations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Present value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of calculating the present value referred to in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall use a discount rate of not more than the current rate on 90-day Treasury bills.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Cash flow margin</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of assessing under subparagraph (A) the ability of a borrower to meet debt obligations and continue farming operations, the Secretary shall assume that the borrower needs up to 110 percent of the amount indicated for payment of farm operating expenses, debt service obligations, and family living expenses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 90 days after receipt of a written request for restructuring from the borrower, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make the calculations specified in paragraphs (2) and (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notify the borrower in writing of the results of such calculations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide documentation for the calculations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Restructuring of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the value of the restructured loan is greater than or equal to the recovery value, the Secretary shall, within 45 days after notifying the borrower of such calculations, offer to restructure the loan obligations of the borrower under this chapter through primary loan service programs that would enable the borrower to meet the obligations (as modified) under the loan and to continue the farming operations of the borrower. If the borrower accepts <!-- PDFPage:991 -->such offer, within 45 days after receipt of notice of acceptance, the Secretary shall restructure the loan accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Termination of loan obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The obligations of a borrower to the Secretary under a loan shall terminate if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the borrower satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of the restructured loan is less than the recovery value; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not later than 90 days after receipt of the notification described in paragraph (4)(B), the borrower pays (or obtains third-party financing to pay) the Secretary an amount equal to the current market value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Negotiation of appraisal</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a determination concerning restructuring under this subsection, the Secretary, at the request of the borrower, shall enter into negotiations concerning appraisals required under this subsection with the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Independent appraisal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the borrower, based on a separate current appraisal, objects to the decision of the Secretary regarding an appraisal, the borrower and the Secretary shall mutually agree, to the extent practicable, on an independent appraiser who shall conduct another appraisal of the borrower's property. The average of the two appraisals that are closest in value shall become the final appraisal under this paragraph. The borrower and the Secretary shall each pay one-half of the cost of the independent appraisal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Principal and interest write-down</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Priority consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In selecting the restructuring alternatives to be used in the case of a borrower who has requested restructuring under this section, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to the use of principal and interest write-down, except that this procedure shall not be given first priority in the case of a borrower unless other creditors of such borrower (other than those creditors who are fully collateralized) representing a substantial portion of the total debt of the borrower held by such creditors, agree to participate in the development of the restructuring plan or agree to participate in a State mediation program.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure of creditors to agree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Failure of creditors to agree to participate in the restructuring plan or mediation program shall not preclude the use of principal and interest write-down by the Secretary if the Secretary determines that this restructuring alternative results in the least cost to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Participation of creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before eliminating the option to use debt write-down in the case of a borrower, the Secretary shall make a reasonable effort to contact the creditors of such borrower, either directly or through the borrower, and encourage such creditors to participate with the Secretary in the development of a restructuring plan for the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Shared appreciation arrangements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As a condition of restructuring a loan in accordance with this section, the borrower of the loan may be required to enter into a shared appreciation arrangement that requires the repayment of amounts written off or set aside.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Shared appreciation agreements shall have a term not to exceed 10 years, and shall provide for recapture based on the difference between the appraised values of the real security property at the time of restructuring and at the time of recapture.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Percentage of recapture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the appreciation to be recaptured by the Secretary shall be 75 percent of the appreciation in the value of such real security property if the recapture occurs within 4 years of the restructuring, and 50 percent if the recapture occurs during the remainder of the term of the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Time of recapture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Recapture shall take place at the end of the term of the agreement, or sooner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the conveyance of the real security property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the repayment of the loans; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the borrower ceases farming operations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Transfer of title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Transfer of title to the spouse of a borrower on the death of such borrower shall not be treated as a conveyance for the purpose of paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notice of recapture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning with fiscal year 2000 not later than 12 months before the end of the term of a shared appreciation arrangement, the Secretary shall notify the borrower involved of the provisions of the arrangement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Financing of recapture payment</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Existing amortizations and loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The interest rate applicable to an amortization or loan made by the Secretary be<!-- PDFPage:992 -->fore October 28, 2000, to finance a recapture payment owed to the Secretary under this subsection may not exceed the rate applicable to a loan to reacquire homestead property less 100 basis points.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Determination to restructure</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No foreclosure or other similar actions shall be taken to liquidate any loan determined to be ineligible for restructuring by the Secretary under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) until the borrower has been given the opportunity to appeal such decision; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Certified lenders program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may establish a program under which the Secretary may guarantee a loan for any rural development program that is made by a lender certified by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may certify a lender if the lender meets such criteria as the Secretary may prescribe in regulations, including the ability of the lender to properly make, service, and liquidate the guaranteed loans of the lender.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Condition of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As a condition of certification, the Secretary may require the lender to undertake to service the guaranteed loan using standards that are not less stringent than generally accepted banking standards concerning loan servicing that are used by prudent commercial or cooperative lenders.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may guarantee not more than 80 percent of a loan made by a certified lender described in paragraph (1), if the borrower of the loan meets the eligibility requirements and such other criteria for the loan guarantee that are established by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Certifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to loans to be guaranteed, the Secretary may permit a certified lender to make appropriate certifications (as provided in regulations issued by the Secretary)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the borrower is in compliance with all requirements of law, including regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Relationship to other requirements</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Revocation of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The designation of a lender as a preferred certified lender shall be revoked if the Secretary determines that the lender is not adhering to the rules and regulations applicable to the program or if the loss experiences of the <!-- PDFPage:999 -->preferred certified lender are greater than other preferred certified lenders, except that the suspension or revocation shall not affect any outstanding guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Condition of certification</h4>
