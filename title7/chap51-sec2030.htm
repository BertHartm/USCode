<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon written application of the State of Washington (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;State&rdquo;) and after the approval of such application by the Secretary, the State may conduct a Family Independence Demonstration Project (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;) in all or in part of the State in accordance with this section to determine whether the Project, as an alternative to providing benefits under the food stamp program, would more effectively break the cycle of poverty and would provide families with opportunities for economic independence and strengthened family functioning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nature of Project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In an application submitted under subsection (a) of this section, the State shall provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Except as provided in this section, the provisions of chapter 434 of the 1987 Washington Laws, as enacted in May 1987, shall apply to the operation of the Project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All of the following terms and conditions shall be in effect under the Project:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), individuals with respect to whom benefits may be paid under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], and such other individuals as are included in the Project pursuant to chapter 434 of the 1987 Washington Laws, as enacted in May 1987, shall be eligible to participate in the Project in lieu of receiving benefits under the food stamp program and cash assistance under any other Federal program covered by the Project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Individuals who receive only child care or medical benefits under the Project shall not be eligible to receive food assistance under the Project. Such individuals may receive coupons under the food stamp program if eligible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Individuals who participate in the Project shall receive for each month an amount of cash assistance that is not less than the total value of the assistance such individuals would otherwise receive, in the aggregate, under the food stamp program and any cash-assistance Federal program covered by the Project for such month, including income and resource exclusions and deductions, and benefit levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) The State may provide a standard benefit for food assistance under the Project, except that individuals who participate in the Project shall receive as food assistance for a month an amount of cash that is not less than the value of the assistance such individuals would otherwise receive under the food stamp program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The State may provide a cash benefit for food assistance equal to the value of the thrifty food plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Each month participants in the Project shall be notified by the State of the amount of Project assistance that is provided as food assistance for such month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The State shall have a program to require participants to engage in employment and training activities carried out under chapter 434 of the 1987 Washington Laws, as enacted in May 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Food assistance shall be provided under the Project&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to any participant for the period that begins on the date such participant applies to participate in the Project, except that the amount of such assistance shall be reduced to reflect the pro rata value of any coupons received under the food stamp program for such period for the benefit of such participant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) until&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participant's cash assistance under the Project is terminated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such participant is informed of such termination and is advised of the <!-- PDFPage:1131 -->eligibility requirements for participation in the food stamp program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the State determines whether such participant will be eligible to receive coupons as a member of a household under the food stamp program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) coupons under the food stamp program are received by such participant if such participant will be eligible to receive coupons as a member of a household under the food stamp program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) An individual who applies to participate in the Project may be represented by another person in the review process if the other person has been clearly designated as the representative of such individual for that purpose, by such individual or the spouse of such individual, and, in the case of the review process, the representative is an adult who is sufficiently aware of relevant circumstances, except that the State may&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the portion of the administrative costs for which the State would have received reimbursement under&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">except that this paragraph shall not be construed to prevent the State from claiming payments for additional households that would qualify for benefits under the food stamp program in the absence of a cash out of such benefits as a result of changes in economic, demographic, and other conditions in the State or a subsequent change in the benefit levels approved by the State legislature.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) An assurance that the State will continue to carry out the food stamp program while the State carries out the Project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) from funds appropriated under this chapter, pay the State for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) applies to participate in the Project;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">may not be reduced or terminated because such individual applies to participate in the Project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For households eligible to participate in the food stamp program that contain some members who participate in the Project and other members who do not participate in the Project, those members who do not participate in the Project shall receive a separate benefit in food coupons under the food stamp program that is not less than the amount of food stamp benefits that such members would have received were the Project not implemented.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver</h4>
