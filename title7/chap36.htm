<p class="note-body">In subsec. (a), &ldquo;chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1949&rdquo; on authority of Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 631, the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions that authorized personnel paid by the hour, day, or month when actually employed, and county crop insurance committeemen to have their compensation fixed without regard to &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1923, as amended&rdquo; were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973 repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this subsection because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Act Sept. 6, 1966, Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;8(a), 80 Stat. 632 (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5, U.S.C., into law). Section 5102 of Title 5, now contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsec. (b), reference to &ldquo;subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;the Act entitled &lsquo;An Act to provide compensation for employees of the United States suffering injuries while in the performance of their duties, and for other purposes&rsquo;, approved September 7, 1916, as amended&rdquo; on authority of Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 631, the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation shall contract with a qualified person to review the quality loss adjustment procedures of the Corporation so that the procedures more accurately reflect local quality discounts that are applied to agricultural commodities insured under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if a producer who is eligible to receive benefits under catastrophic risk protection under subsection (b) of this section is also eligible to receive assistance for the same loss under any other program administered by the Secretary, the producer shall be required to elect whether to receive benefits under this chapter or under the other program, but not both. A producer who purchases additional coverage under subsection (c) of this section may also receive assistance for the same loss under other programs administered by the Secretary, except that the amount received for the loss under the additional coverage together with the amount received under the other programs may not exceed the amount of the actual loss of the producer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B), the producer shall be responsible for a premium for the first crop that is commensurate with the indemnity paid under paragraph (1)(B)(ii).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of double cropping described in subsection (d) of this section, if a producer make an election under paragraph (1)(B) for a crop year, the Corporation shall assign the producer a recorded yield for that crop year for the first crop equal to 60 percent of the producer's actual production history for the agricultural commodity involved, for purposes of determining the producer's actual production history for subsequent crop years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Area conditions required for payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall limit prevented planting payments for producers to those situations <!-- PDFPage:761 -->in which other producers, in the area where a first crop is prevented from being planted is located, are also generally affected by the conditions that prevented the first crop from being planted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Planting date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a producer plants the second crop before the latest planting date established by the Corporation for the first crop, the Corporation shall not make a prevented planting payment with regard to the first crop.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for established double cropping practices</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The producer has a history of planting two or more crops for harvest in the same crop year or the applicable acreage has historically had two or more crops planted for harvest in the same crop year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The second or more crops are customarily planted after the first crop for harvest on the same acreage in the same year in the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Subsequent crops</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in the case of double cropping described in subsection (d) of this section, if a producer elects to plant a crop (other than a replanted crop) subsequent to a second crop on the same acreage as the first crop and second crop for harvest in the same crop year, the producer shall not be eligible for insurance under this chapter, or noninsured crop assistance under section 7333 of this title, for the subsequent crop.</p>
