<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If sufficient actuarial data are available (as determined by the Corporation), the Corporation may insure, or provide reinsurance for insurers of, producers of agricultural commodities grown in the United States under 1 or more plans of insurance determined by the Corporation to be adapted to the agricultural commodity concerned.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the cases of tobacco and potatoes, insurance shall not extend beyond the period during which the insured commodity is in the field.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the neglect or malfeasance of the producer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the failure of the producer to reseed to the same crop in such areas and under such circumstances as it is customary to reseed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure of the producer to follow good farming practices (as determined by the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Expansion to other areas or single producers</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Producer expansion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In an area in the United States or specified in subparagraph (A) where crop insurance is not available for a particular agricultural commodity, the Corporation may offer to enter into a written agreement with an individual producer operating in the area for insurance coverage under this chapter if the producer has actuarially sound data relating to the production by the producer of the commodity and the data is acceptable to the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Dissemination of crop insurance information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall make available to producers through local offices of the Department&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) current and complete information on all aspects of Federal crop insurance; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Catastrophic risk protection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall offer a catastrophic risk protection plan to indemnify producers for crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if provided by the Corporation, when the producer is unable, because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as determined by the Secretary), to plant other crops for harvest on the acreage for the crop year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of coverage</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reduction in actual payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount paid to a producer on a claim under catastrophic risk protection may reflect a reduction that is proportional to the out-of-pocket expenses that are not incurred by the producer as a result of not planting, growing, or harvesting the crop for which the claim is made, as determined by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Yield and loss basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer shall have the option of basing the catastrophic coverage of the producer on an individual yield and loss basis or on an area yield and loss basis, if both options are offered by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sale of catastrophic risk coverage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Catastrophic risk coverage may be offered by&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Actual production history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall determine yield coverage using the actual production history of the producer over a period of not less than the 4 previous consecutive crop years and not more than 10 consecutive crop years. Subject to paragraph (3), the yield for the year in which noninsured crop disaster assistance is sought shall be equal to the average of the actual production history of the producer during the period considered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assignment of yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a producer does not submit adequate documentation of production history to determine a crop yield under paragraph (2), the Corporation shall assign to the producer a yield equal to not less than 65 percent of the transitional yield of the producer (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Corporation for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Corporation based on production history requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prohibition on assigned yields in certain counties</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If sufficient data are available to demonstrate that the acreage of a crop in a county for the crop year has increased by more than 100 percent over any year in the preceding 7 crop years or, if data are not available, if the acreage of the crop in the county has increased significantly from the previous crop years, a producer must provide such detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and yield for the crop year for which benefits are being claimed as is required by the Corporation. If the Corporation determines that the documentation provided is not sufficient, the Corporation may require documenting proof that the crop, had the crop been harvested, could have been marketed at a reasonable price.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a producer who produces a crop on a farm located in a county described in clause (i) may not obtain an assigned yield.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A crop or a producer shall not be subject to this subsection if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the Deputy Administrator approves the recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on receipt of subsequent assigned yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer who receives an assigned yield for the current year of a natural disaster because required production records were not submitted to the local office of the Department shall not be eligible for an assigned yield for the year of the next natural disaster unless the required production records of the previous 1 or more years (as applicable) are provided to the local office.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Yield variations due to different farming practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall ensure that noninsured crop disaster assistance accurately reflects significant yield variations due to different farming practices, such as between irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Contract payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A producer who has received a guaranteed payment for production, as opposed to delivery, of a crop pursuant to a contract shall have the production of the producer adjusted upward by the amount of the production equal to the amount of the contract payment received.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment of losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments for noninsured crop disaster assistance losses under this section shall be made from the insurance fund established under section 1516 of this title.
