<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If sufficient actuarial data are available (as determined by the Corporation), the Corporation may insure, or provide reinsurance for insurers of, producers of agricultural commodities grown in the United States under 1 or more plans of insurance determined by the Corporation to be adapted to the agricultural commodity concerned. To qualify for coverage under a plan of insurance, the losses of the insured commodity must be due to drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as determined by the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the cases of tobacco and potatoes, insurance shall not extend beyond the period during which the insured commodity is in the field.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the failure of the producer to reseed to the same crop in such areas and under such circumstances as it is customary to reseed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure of the producer to follow good farming practices (as determined by the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Expansion to other areas or single producers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Area expansion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation may offer plans of insurance or reinsurance for production of agricultural commodities in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau in the same manner as provided in this section for production of agricultural commodities in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Producer expansion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In an area in the United States or specified in subparagraph (A) where crop insurance is not available for a particular agricultural commodity, the Corporation may offer to enter into a written agreement with an individual producer operating in the area for insurance coverage under this chapter if the producer has actuarially sound data relating to the production by the producer of the commodity and the data is acceptable to the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Dissemination of crop insurance information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall make available to producers through local offices of the Department&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) current and complete information on all aspects of Federal crop insurance; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Catastrophic risk protection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall offer a catastrophic risk protection plan to indemnify producers for crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if provided by the Corporation, when the producer is unable, because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as determined by the Secretary), to plant other crops for harvest on the acreage for the crop year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of each of the 1999 and subsequent crop years, catastrophic risk protection shall offer a producer coverage for a 50 percent loss in yield, on an individual yield or area yield basis, indemnified at 55 percent of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage (as determined by the Corporation).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reduction in actual payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount paid to a producer on a claim under catastrophic risk protection may reflect a reduction that is proportional to the out-of-pocket expenses that are not incurred by the producer as a result of not planting, growing, or harvesting the crop for which the claim is made, as determined by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Yield and loss basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer shall have the option of basing the catastrophic coverage of the producer on an individual yield and loss basis or on an area yield and loss basis, if both options are offered by the Corporation.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of fees</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Fees up to $100</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) Fees collected by USDA offices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Not more than $100 of the administrative fees paid by a producer for catastrophic risk coverage that are collected by an office of the Department shall be credited to the appropriations account providing funds for the payment of operating and administrative expenses incurred for the delivery of catastrophic risk protection under this section.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Transitional coverage for 1995 crops</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Effective only for a 1995 crop planted or for which insurance attached prior to January 1, 1995, the Corporation shall allow producers of the crops until not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 [Oct. 13, 1994] to obtain catastrophic risk protection for the crop. On enactment of such Act, a producer who made timely purchases of a crop insurance policy before the date of enactment of such Act, under the provisions of this chapter then in effect, shall be eligible for the same benefits to which a producer would be entitled under comparable additional coverage under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To be eligible for additional coverage, a producer must apply to an approved insurance provider for purchase of additional coverage if the coverage is available from an approved insurance provider. If additional coverage is unavailable privately, the Corporation may offer additional coverage plans of insurance directly to producers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfer of relevant information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a producer has already applied for catastrophic risk protection at the local office of the Department and elects to purchase additional coverage, the relevant information for the crop of the producer shall be transferred to the approved insurance provider servicing the additional coverage crop policy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Yield and loss basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer shall have the option of purchasing additional coverage based on an individual yield and loss basis or on an area yield and loss basis, if both options are offered by the Corporation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Price elections</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), insurance coverage shall be made available to a pro<!-- PDFPage:794 -->ducer on the basis of any price election that equals or is less than the price election established by the Corporation. The coverage shall be quoted in terms of dollars per acre.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimum price elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation may establish minimum price elections below which levels of insurance shall not be offered.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Wheat classes and malting barley</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation shall, as the Corporation determines practicable, offer producers different price elections for classes of wheat and malting barley (including contract prices in the case of malting barley), in addition to the standard price election, that reflect different market prices, as determined by the Corporation. The Corporation shall, as the Corporation determines practicable, offer additional coverage for each class determined under this subparagraph and charge a premium for each class that is actuarially sound.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Fire and hail coverage</h4>

On written notice of the election to the company issuing the policy providing additional coverage and submission of evidence of substitute coverage on the commodity insured, the premium of the producer shall be reduced by an amount determined by the Corporation to be actuarially appropriate, taking into account the actuarial value of the remaining coverage provided by the Corporation. In no event shall the producer be given credit for an amount of premium determined to be greater than the actuarial value of the protection against losses caused by fire and hail that is included in the additional coverage for the crop.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) State premium subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation may enter into an agreement with any State or agency of a State under which the State or agency may pay to the approved insurance provider an additional premium subsidy to further reduce the portion of the premium paid by producers in the State.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Administrative fee</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Fee required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, if a producer elects to purchase additional coverage for a crop at a level that is less than 65 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at 100 percent of the expected market price, or an equivalent coverage, the producer shall pay an administrative fee for the additional coverage. Subsection (b)(5) of this section shall apply in determining the amount and use of the administrative fee or in determining whether to waive the administrative fee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a producer elects to purchase additional coverage for a crop equal to 65 percent or more of the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at 100 percent of the expected market price, or an equivalent coverage, the producer shall not be subject to the administrative fee required by this paragraph or subsection (b)(5) of this section. If the producer has already paid the administrative fee for a lower level of coverage for the crop, the administrative fee shall be refunded to the producer unless the refund would reduce to less than $200 the total amount of the administrative fees paid by the producer for 2 or more crops in the same county for which a lower level of coverage is obtained.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Additional fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a producer elects to purchase additional coverage for a crop equal to or exceeding 65 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield and 100 percent of the expected market price or an equivalent coverage, the producer shall pay an administrative fee of $10 for the coverage. If a producer has already paid an administrative fee for lesser coverage for the crop, the fee for lesser coverage shall be refunded to the producer unless the producer has paid the maximum fee for lesser coverage and refund of the fee will not reduce the amount to be paid below the maximum amount.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Deposit of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the authority granted to the Secretary under the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation account provisions of the Agricultural, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995, administrative fees collected under subparagraph (B) in excess of $100 per producer per county and under subparagraph (C) shall be deposited in the insurance fund established under section 1516(c) of this title to be available for the programs and activities of the Corporation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Premium reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an approved insurance provider determines that the provider may provide insurance more efficiently than the expense reimbursement amount established by the Corporation, the approved insurance provider may reduce, subject to the approval of the Corporation, the premium charged the insured by an amount corresponding to the efficiency. The approved insurance provider shall apply to the Corporation for authority to reduce the premium before making such a reduction, and the reduction shall be subject to the rules, limitations, and procedures established by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Individual and area crop insurance coverage</h4>

Subject to the goal of ensuring actuarial soundness for the crop insurance program, the sales closing date shall be established by the Corporation to maximize convenience to producers in obtaining benefits under price and production adjustment programs of the Department. Beginning with the 1995 crop year, the Corporation shall establish, for an insurance policy for each insurable crop that is planted in the spring, a sales closing date that is 30 days earlier than the corresponding sales closing date that was established for the 1994 crop year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Records and reporting</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Actual production history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), the yield for a crop shall be based on the actual production history for the crop, if the crop was produced on the farm without penalty during each of the 4 crop years immediately preceding the crop year for which actual production history is being established, building up to a production data base for each of the 10 consecutive crop years preceding the crop year for which actual production history is being established.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Assigned yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the producer does not provide satisfactory evidence of the yield of a commodity under subparagraph (A), the producer shall be assigned a yield that is not less than 65 percent of the transitional yield of the producer (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Corporation for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Corporation based on production history requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Area yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Corporation may offer a crop insurance plan based on an area yield that allows an insured producer to qualify for an indemnity if a loss has occurred in an area (as specified by the Corporation) in which the farm of the producer is located.
