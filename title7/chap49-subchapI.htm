<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection, the interest rates on loans under this subchapter shall be as determined by the Secretary, but not in excess of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, plus not to exceed 1 per centum, as determined by the Secretary, and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution or laws of any State limiting the rate or amount of interest that may be charged, taken, received, or reserved, except as provided in paragraph (6), the interest rates on loans (other than guaranteed loans), to public bodies or nonprofit associations (including Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other federally recognized Indian tribal groups) for water and waste disposal facilities and essential community facilities shall be set by the Secretary at rates not to exceed the current market yield for outstanding municipal obligations with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturity for such loans, and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum; and not in excess of 5 per centum per annum for any such loans which are for the upgrading of existing facilities or construction of new facilities as required to meet applicable health or sanitary standards in areas where the median household income of the persons to be served by such facility is below the higher of 80 per centum of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income or the poverty line established by the Office of Management and Budget, as revised under section 9902(2) of title 42 and in other areas as the Secretary may designate where a significant percentage of the persons to be served by such facilities are of low income, as determined by the Secretary; and not in excess of 7 per centum per annum on loans for such facilities that do not qualify for the 5 per centum per annum interest rate but are located in areas where the median household income of the persons to be served by the facility does not exceed 100 per centum of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as provided in paragraph (6), the interest rate on loans (other than guaranteed loans) under section 1934 of this title shall not be&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the interest rate on any loan made under this subchapter as a guaranteed loan shall be such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the lender, but not in excess of a rate as may be determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a loan made under section 1932 of this title as a guaranteed loan, subparagraph (A) shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution or laws of any State limiting the rate or amount of interest that may be charged, taken, received, or reserved.</p>

Wherever practicable, construction by a State, municipality, or other political subdivision of local government that is supported by loans described in the preceding sentence shall be placed on land that is not prime farmland, in order to preserve the maximum practicable amount of prime farmlands for production of food and fiber. Where other options exist for the siting of such construction and where the governmental authority still desires to carry out such construction on prime farmland, the 2 per centum interest rate increase provided by this clause shall apply, but such increased interest rate shall not apply where such other options do not exist.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The authorities referred to in subparagraph (A) are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) clauses (2) and (3) of section 1923(a) of this title,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of charges; prepayment of taxes and insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The borrower shall pay such fees and other charges as the Secretary may require, and borrowers under this chapter shall prepay to the Secretary such taxes and insurance as the Secretary may require, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mortgages, liens, and other security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall take as security for the obligations entered into in connection with loans, mortgages on farms with respect to which such loans are made or such other security as the Secretary may require, and for obligations in connection with loans to associations under section 1926 of this title, shall take liens on the facility or such other security as he may determine to be necessary. Such security instruments may constitute liens running to the United States notwithstanding the fact that the notes may be held by lenders other than the United States. A borrower may use the same collateral to secure two or more loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this subchapter, except that the outstanding amount of such loans may not exceed the total value of the collateral so used.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mineral rights as collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a farm ownership loan made after December 23, 1985, unless appraised values of the rights to oil, gas, or other minerals are specifically included as part of the appraised value of collateral securing the loan, the rights to oil, gas, or other minerals located under the property shall not be considered part of the collateral securing the loan. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the inclusion of, as part of the collateral securing the loan, any payment or other compensation the borrower may receive for damages to the surface of the collateral real estate resulting from the exploration for or recovery of minerals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Additional collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require any borrower to provide additional collateral to secure a farmer program loan made or insured under this chapter, if the borrower is current in the payment of principal and interest on the loan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) bring any action to foreclose, or otherwise liquidate, any such loan as a result of the failure of a borrower to provide additional collateral to secure a loan, if the borrower was current in the payment of principal and interest on the loan at the time the additional collateral was requested.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Revolving fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The fund established pursuant to section 11(a) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended, shall hereafter be called the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund and is hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;. The fund shall remain available as a revolving fund for the discharge of the obligations of the Secretary under agreements insuring loans under this subchapter and loans and mortgages insured under prior authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposits of funds; investments; purchase of notes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund or invested in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States. The Secretary may purchase with money in the fund any notes issued by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining money for the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notes; form and denominations; maturities; terms and conditions; interest rate; purchase by Treasury; public debt transaction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to make and issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations under this section and for authorized expenditures out of the fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this subchapter. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notes and security as part of fund; collection or sale of notes; deposit of net proceeds in fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notes and security acquired by the Secretary in connection with loans insured under this subchapter and under prior authority shall become a part of the fund. Notes may be held in the fund and collected in accordance with their terms or may be sold by the Secretary with or without agreements for insurance thereof at the balance due thereon, or on such other basis as the Secretary may determine from time to time. All net proceeds from such collections, including sales of notes or property, shall be deposited in and become a part of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit in fund of portion of charge on outstanding principal obligations; availability of remainder of charge, and merger with appropriations, for administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall deposit in the fund all or a portion, not to exceed one-half of 1 per centum of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, of any charge collected in connection with the insurance of loans; and any remainder of any such charge shall be available for administrative expenses of the Farmers Home Administration and the Rural Development Administration, in proportion to such charges collected in connection with the insurance of loans by such agency, to be transferred annually and become merged with any appropriation for administrative expenses for such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Utilization of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may utilize the fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to make loans which could be insured under this subchapter whenever the Secretary has reasonable assurance that they can be sold without undue delay, and may sell and insure such loans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay amounts to which the holder of the note is entitled on loans heretofore or hereafter insured accruing between the date of any payments made by the borrower and the date of transmittal of any such payments to the lender. In the discretion of the Secretary, payments other than final payments need not be remitted to the holder until due or until the next agreed annual or semiannual remittance date;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:945 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to pay to the holder of the notes any deferred or defaulted installment or, upon assignment of the note to the Secretary at the Secretary's request, the entire balance due on the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to purchase notes in accordance with agreements previously entered into;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to pay for contract services, taxes, insurance, prior liens, expenses necessary to make fiscal adjustments in connection with the application and transmittal of collections and other expenses and advances authorized in connection with insured loans, including the difference between interest payable by borrowers and interest to which insured lenders or insured holders are entitled under agreements with the Secretary included in contracts of insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to pay the Secretary's costs of administration necessary to insure, make grants, service, and otherwise carry out the programs under this chapter not specifically covered by the Rural Development Insurance Fund of section 1929a of this title, including costs of the Secretary incidental to guaranteeing loans under this chapter, either directly from the Fund or by transfers from the Fund to, and merger with, any appropriations for administrative expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transfer of funds from Farmers Home Administration direct loan account and Emergency Credit Revolving Fund; abolition of such account and fund; payments from Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The assets and liabilities of, and authorizations applicable to, the Farmers Home Administration direct loan account created by section 1988(c) of this title and the Emergency Credit Revolving Fund referred to in section 1966 of this title are hereby transferred to the fund, and such account and such revolving fund are hereby abolished. Such assets and their proceeds, including loans made out of the fund pursuant to this section, shall be subject to the provisions of this section, section 1928, the last sentence of section 1926(a)(1), and the last sentence of section 1927 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) From time to time, and at least at the close of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay from the fund into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts interest on the value as determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Comptroller General, of the Government's equity transferred to the fund pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection plus the cumulative amount of appropriations made available after enactment of this provision as capital and for administration of the programs financed from the fund, less the average undisbursed cash balance in the fund during the year. The rate of such interest shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of loans made or insured from the fund, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. Interest payments may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, but any interest payments so deferred shall themselves bear interest. If at any time the Secretary determines that moneys in the fund exceed present and any reasonably prospective future requirements of the fund, such excess may be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Guaranteed loans; interest rate for loans sold into secondary market; loan fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may provide financial assistance to borrowers for purposes provided in this chapter by guaranteeing loans made by any Federal or State chartered bank, savings and loan association, cooperative lending agency, or other legally organized lending agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The interest rate payable by a borrower on the portion of a guaranteed loan that is sold by a lender to the secondary market under this chapter may be lower than the interest rate charged on the portion retained by the lender, but shall not exceed the average interest rate charged by the lender on loans made to farm and ranch borrowers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With regard to any loan guarantee on a loan made by a commercial or cooperative lender related to a loan made by the Secretary under section 1935 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary shall not charge a fee to any person (including a lender); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a lender may charge a loan origination and servicing fee in an amount not to exceed 1 percent of the amount of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Coordination of assistance for qualified beginning farmers and ranchers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 60 days after any State expresses to the Secretary, in writing, a desire to coordinate the provision of financial assistance to qualified beginning farmers and ranchers in the State, the Secretary and the State shall conclude a joint memorandum of understanding that shall govern the coordination of the provision of the financial assistance by the State and the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The memorandum of understanding shall provide that if a State beginning farmer program makes a commitment to provide a qualified beginning farmer or rancher with financing to establish or maintain a viable farming or ranching operation, the Secretary shall, subject to applicable law, normal loan approval criteria, and the availability of funds provide the farmer or rancher with a down payment loan under section 1935 of this title or a guarantee of the financing provided by the State program, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall not charge any person (including a lender) any fee with respect to the provision of any guarantee under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall notify each State of the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;State beginning farmer program&rdquo; means any program that is&mdash;</p>
