Because the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; was not capitalized in that phrase in the first sentence, section 103(b) did not apply to that phrase and therefore section 103(a) was executed, resulting in the substitution of &ldquo;the Commission or the commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo;.</p>
