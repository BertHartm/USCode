<p class="statutory-body">All public and private educational institutions, other public and private research institu<!-- PDFPage:1445 -->tions and organizations, Federal agencies, and individuals shall be eligible to receive a grant from, or enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with, the Corporation for a research, development, or demonstration project, as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Competitive basis for awards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Grants made, and contracts and cooperative agreements entered into, under this section shall be selected on a competitive basis on the recommendation of a peer review system to be established by the Corporation.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Selection criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporate Board may select a research, development, or demonstration project to receive a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under this section based on the likelihood that the project will result in creating or improving economically viable commercial nonfood, nonfeed products, applications, processes, or technologies that involve the use of raw or processed agricultural commodities. The criteria to be considered may include the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the potential market size of the new nonfood, nonfeed product, the likely time period needed to bring the product into the stream of commerce for general use, and the likely availability of the agricultural commodity used to produce the product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the potential for job creation in an economically distressed rural area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the anticipated State or local participation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the anticipated financial participation of private entities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the likely impact on reducing Federal crop subsidies and other Federal agricultural assistance program costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the unavailability of adequate funding from other sources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the likely positive impact on resource conservation and the environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the likely positive effect of helping family-sized farmers and rural communities near the affected agricultural and forested areas.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not less than two-thirds of the funds obligated each fiscal year for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under this section shall be awarded only for research, development, and demonstration projects for which the applicant&mdash;</p>
