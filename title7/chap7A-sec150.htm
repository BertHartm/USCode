<p class="statutory-body">To protect potato and tomato production in the United States from the destructive pest known as the golden nematode which subsists on the roots of potatoes and tomatoes, causes marked reduction in yield, persists in the soil for many years in an inactive state in the absence of preferred hosts, and becomes active and destructive when potatoes or tomatoes are again planted, it is the policy of the Government of the United States, independently or in cooperation with State and local governmental agencies, and other public and private organizations, associations, and individuals, to eradicate, suppress, control, and prevent the spread of, this pest.</p>
