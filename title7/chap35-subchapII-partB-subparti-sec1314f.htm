If marketing quotas are in effect in an area for more than one kind of quota tobacco, nonquota tobacco produced in the area shall be subject to the quota for the kind of quota tobacco produced in the area having the highest price support under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.].</p>
