<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) When the governing board thereof provides for the making and filing by the board or any member thereof, as the Commission may direct, of reports in accordance with the rules and regulations, and in such manner and form and at such times as may be prescribed by the Commission, showing the details and terms of all transactions entered into by the board, or the members thereof, either in cash transactions or transactions for future delivery consummated on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, and when such governing board provides, in accordance with such rules and regulations, for the keeping of a record by the board or the members of the board of trade, as the Commission may direct, showing the details and terms of all cash and future transactions entered into by them, consummated on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, such record to be in permanent form, showing the parties to all such transactions, including the persons for whom made, any assignments or transfers thereof, with the parties thereto, and the manner in which said transactions are fulfilled, discharged, or terminated.
