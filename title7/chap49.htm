The Secretary may also make loans to any borrower to whom a loan has been made under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.), for the conservation, development, use, and control of water, and the installation of drainage or waste disposal facilities, primarily serving farmers, ranchers, farm tenants, farm laborers, rural businesses, and other rural residents. When any loan made for a purpose specified in this paragraph is sold out of the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund as an insured loan, the interest or other income thereon paid to an insured holder shall be included in gross income for purposes of chapter 1 of title 26. With respect to loans of less than $500,000 made or insured under this paragraph that are evidenced by notes and mortgages, as distinguished from bond issues, borrowers shall not be required to appoint bond counsel to review the legal validity of the loan whenever the Secretary has available legal counsel to perform such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to make grants aggregating not to exceed $500,000,000 in any fiscal year to such associations to finance specific projects for works for the development, storage, treatment, purification, or distribution of water or the collection, treatment, or disposal of waste in rural areas. The amount of any grant made under the authority of this paragraph shall not exceed 75 per centum of the development cost of the project to serve the area which the association determines can be feasibly served by the facility and to adequately serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area. The Secretary shall fix the grant rate for each project in conformity with regulations issued by the Secretary that shall provide for a graduated scale of grant rates establishing higher rates for projects in communities that have lower community population and income levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No grant shall be made under paragraph (2) of this subsection in connection with any project unless the Secretary determines that the project (i) will serve a rural area which, if such project is carried out, is not likely to decline in population below that for which the project was designed, (ii) is designed and constructed so that adequate capacity will or can be made available to serve the present population of the area to the extent feasible and to serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area, and (iii) is necessary for an orderly community development consistent with a comprehensive community water, waste disposal, or other development plan of the rural area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(9) No Federal funds shall be authorized for use unless it be certified by the appropriate State water pollution control agency that the water supply system authorized will not result in pollution of waters of the State in excess of standards established by that agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) In the case of sewers and waste disposal systems, no Federal funds shall be advanced hereunder unless the appropriate State water pollution control agency shall certify that the effluent therefrom shall conform with appropriate State and Federal water pollution control standards when and where established.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Loans made under this section shall be for the same repayment period as insured loans made by the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration to such borrowers under title III of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 930 et seq.) and interest rates on loans made under this section shall not exceed 5 percent.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest rate reduction authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to facilitate the obtaining of private sector capital, the Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, reduce the interest rate on loans provided under this section when such reduction is appropriate and will enable the borrower to obtain such private capital.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection, the interest rates on loans under this subchapter shall be as determined by the Secretary, but not in excess of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, plus not to exceed 1 per centum, as determined by the Secretary, and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution or laws of any State limiting the rate or amount of interest that may be charged, taken, received, or reserved, except as provided in paragraph (6), the interest rates on loans (other than guaranteed loans), to public bodies or nonprofit associations (including Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other federally recognized Indian tribal groups) for water and waste disposal facilities and essential community facilities shall be set by the Secretary at rates not to exceed the current market yield for outstanding municipal obligations with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturity for such loans, and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum; and not in excess of 5 per centum per annum for any such loans which are for the upgrading of existing facilities or construction of new facilities as required to meet applicable health or sanitary standards in areas where the median household income of the persons to be served by such facility is below the higher of 80 per centum of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income or the poverty line established by the Office of Management and Budget, as revised under section 9902(2) of title 42 and in other areas as the Secretary may designate where a significant percentage of the persons to be served by such facilities are of low income, as determined by the Secretary; and not in excess of 7 per centum per annum on loans for such facilities that do not qualify for the 5 per centum per annum interest rate but are located in areas where the median household income of the persons to be served by the facility does not exceed 100 per centum of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income.</p>

Wherever practicable, construction by a State, municipality, or other political subdivision of local government that is supported by loans described in the preceding sentence shall be placed on land that is not prime farmland, in order to preserve the maximum practicable amount of prime farmlands for production of food and fiber. Where other options exist for the siting of such construction and where the governmental authority still desires to carry out such construction on prime farmland, the 2 per centum interest rate increase provided by this clause shall apply, but such increased interest rate shall not apply where such other options do not exist.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The authorities referred to in subparagraph (A) are&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mortgages, liens, and other security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall take as security for the obligations entered into in connection with loans, mortgages on farms with respect to which such loans are made or such other security as the Secretary may require, and for obligations in connection with loans to associations under section 1926 of this title, shall take liens on the facility or such other security as he may determine to be necessary. Such security instruments may constitute liens running to the United States notwithstanding the fact that the notes may be held by lenders other than the United States. A borrower may use the same collateral to secure two or more loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this subchapter, except that the outstanding amount of such loans may not exceed the total value of the collateral so used.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mineral rights as collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a farm ownership loan made after December 23, 1985, unless appraised values of the rights to oil, gas, or other minerals are specifically included as part of the appraised value of collateral securing the loan, the rights to oil, gas, or other minerals located under the property shall not be considered part of the collateral securing the loan. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the inclusion of, as part of the collateral securing the loan, any payment or other compensation the borrower may receive for damages to the surface of the collateral real estate resulting from the exploration for or recovery of minerals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Additional collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require any borrower to provide additional collateral to secure a farmer program loan made or insured under this chapter, if the borrower is current in the payment of principal and interest on the loan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) bring any action to foreclose, or otherwise liquidate, any such loan as a result of the failure of a borrower to provide additional collateral to secure a loan, if the borrower was current in the payment of principal and interest on the loan at the time the additional collateral was requested.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Revolving fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The fund established pursuant to section 11(a) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended, shall hereafter be called the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund and is hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;. The fund shall remain available as a revolving fund for the discharge of the obligations of the Secretary under agreements insuring loans under this subchapter and loans and mortgages insured under prior authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposits of funds; investments; purchase of notes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund or invested in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States. The Secretary may purchase with money in the fund any notes issued by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining money for the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notes; form and denominations; maturities; terms and conditions; interest rate; purchase by Treasury; public debt transaction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to make and issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations under this section and for authorized expenditures out of the fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this subchapter. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notes and security as part of fund; collection or sale of notes; deposit of net proceeds in fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notes and security acquired by the Secretary in connection with loans insured under this subchapter and under prior authority shall become a part of the fund.

All net proceeds from such collections, including sales of notes or property, shall be deposited in and become a part of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit in fund of portion of charge on outstanding principal obligations; availability of remainder of charge, and merger with appropriations, for administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall deposit in the fund all or a portion, not to exceed one-half of 1 per centum of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, of any charge collected in connection with the insurance of loans; and any remainder of any such charge shall be available for administrative expenses of the Farmers Home Administration and the Rural Development Administration, in proportion to such charges collected in connection with the insurance of loans by such agency, to be transferred annually and become merged with any appropriation for administrative expenses for such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Utilization of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may utilize the fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to make loans which could be insured under this subchapter whenever the Secretary has reasonable assurance that they can be sold without undue delay, and may sell and insure such loans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay amounts to which the holder of the note is entitled on loans heretofore or hereafter insured accruing between the date of any payments made by the borrower and the date of transmittal of any such payments to the lender. In the discretion of the Secretary, payments other than final payments need not be remitted to the holder until due or until the next agreed annual or semiannual remittance date;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:945 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to pay to the holder of the notes any deferred or defaulted installment or, upon assignment of the note to the Secretary at the Secretary's request, the entire balance due on the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to purchase notes in accordance with agreements previously entered into;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to pay for contract services, taxes, insurance, prior liens, expenses necessary to make fiscal adjustments in connection with the application and transmittal of collections and other expenses and advances authorized in connection with insured loans, including the difference between interest payable by borrowers and interest to which insured lenders or insured holders are entitled under agreements with the Secretary included in contracts of insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to pay the Secretary's costs of administration necessary to insure, make grants, service, and otherwise carry out the programs under this chapter not specifically covered by the Rural Development Insurance Fund of section 1929a of this title, including costs of the Secretary incidental to guaranteeing loans under this chapter, either directly from the Fund or by transfers from the Fund to, and merger with, any appropriations for administrative expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transfer of funds from Farmers Home Administration direct loan account and Emergency Credit Revolving Fund; abolition of such account and fund; payments from Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The assets and liabilities of, and authorizations applicable to, the Farmers Home Administration direct loan account created by section 1988(c) of this title and the Emergency Credit Revolving Fund referred to in section 1966 of this title are hereby transferred to the fund, and such account and such revolving fund are hereby abolished. Such assets and their proceeds, including loans made out of the fund pursuant to this section, shall be subject to the provisions of this section, section 1928, the last sentence of section 1926(a)(1), and the last sentence of section 1927 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) From time to time, and at least at the close of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay from the fund into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts interest on the value as determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Comptroller General, of the Government's equity transferred to the fund pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection plus the cumulative amount of appropriations made available after enactment of this provision as capital and for administration of the programs financed from the fund, less the average undisbursed cash balance in the fund during the year. The rate of such interest shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of loans made or insured from the fund, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. Interest payments may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, but any interest payments so deferred shall themselves bear interest. If at any time the Secretary determines that moneys in the fund exceed present and any reasonably prospective future requirements of the fund, such excess may be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Guaranteed loans; interest rate for loans sold into secondary market; loan fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may provide financial assistance to borrowers for purposes provided in this chapter by guaranteeing loans made by any Federal or State chartered bank, savings and loan association, cooperative lending agency, or other legally organized lending agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The interest rate payable by a borrower on the portion of a guaranteed loan that is sold by a lender to the secondary market under this chapter may be lower than the interest rate charged on the portion retained by the lender, but shall not exceed the average interest rate charged by the lender on loans made to farm and ranch borrowers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With regard to any loan guarantee on a loan made by a commercial or cooperative lender related to a loan made by the Secretary under section 1935 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary shall not charge a fee to any person (including a lender); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a lender may charge a loan origination and servicing fee in an amount not to exceed 1 percent of the amount of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Coordination of assistance for qualified beginning farmers and ranchers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 60 days after any State expresses to the Secretary, in writing, a desire to coordinate the provision of financial assistance to qualified beginning farmers and ranchers in the State, the Secretary and the State shall conclude a joint memorandum of understanding that shall govern the coordination of the provision of the financial assistance by the State and the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The memorandum of understanding shall provide that if a State beginning farmer program makes a commitment to provide a qualified beginning farmer or rancher with financing to establish or maintain a viable farming or ranching operation, the Secretary shall, subject to applicable law, normal loan approval criteria, and the availability of funds provide the farmer or rancher with a down payment loan under section 1935 of this title or a guarantee of the financing provided by the State program, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall not charge any person (including a lender) any fee with respect to the provision of any guarantee under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall notify each State of the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;State beginning farmer program&rdquo; means any program that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) carried out by, or under contract with, a State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) designed to assist persons in obtaining the financial assistance necessary to enter agriculture and establish viable farming or ranching operations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No financial or other assistance shall be extended under any provision of this section and sections 1924(b) and 1942(b) of this title, except for cases in which such assistance does not exceed $1,000,000 or for cases in which direct employment will not be increased by more than fifty employees, that is calculated to or is likely to result in the transfer from one area to another of any employment or business activity provided by operations of the applicant, but this limitation shall not be construed to prohibit assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary of such entity if the establishment of such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary will not result in an increase in unemployment in the area of original location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations unless there is reason to believe that such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity in the area of its original location or in any other area where it conducts such operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No financial or other assistance shall be extended under any provision of this section and sections 1924(b) and 1942(b) of this title, except for cases in which such assistance does not exceed $1,000,000 or for cases in which direct employment will not be increased by more than fifty employees, which is calculated to or likely to result in an increase in the production of goods, materials, or commodities, or the availability of services or facilities in the area, when there is not sufficient demand for such goods, materials, commodities, services or facilities, to employ the efficient capacity of existing competitive commercial or industrial enterprises, unless such financial or other assistance will not have an adverse effect upon existing competitive enterprises in the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No financial or other assistance shall be extended under any provision of this section and sections 1924(b) and 1942(b) of this title, except for cases in which such assistance does not exceed $1,000,000 or for cases in which direct employment will not be increased by more than fifty employees, if the Secretary of Labor certifies within 30 days after the matter has been submitted to him by the Secretary of Agriculture that the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection have not been complied with. The Secretary of Labor shall, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, develop a system of certification which will insure the expeditious processing of requests for assistance under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) No provision of law shall prohibit issuance by the Secretary of certificates evidencing beneficial ownership in a block of notes insured or guaranteed under this chapter or Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.]; any sale by the Secretary of such certificates shall be treated as a sale of assets for the purposes of chapter 11 of title 31.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines that the ownership and operation of such subterminal facilities will result in the efficient and competitive movement of bulk agricultural commodities and will return increased benefits to the local producers served by such facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary determines that the rail carrier designated to provide service to any such facility will be able to provide adequate service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary shall make all loans under this subchapter upon the full personal liability of the borrower and upon such security as the Secretary may prescribe. The interest rates on such loans, except for guaranteed loans and loans provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), shall be as determined by the Secretary, but not in excess of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, plus an additional charge not to exceed 1 per centum as determined by the Secretary, which charge shall be deposited in the Rural Development Insurance Fund or the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund, as appropriate, and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. The interest rate on any guaranteed loan made under this subchapter shall be such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and lender, but not in excess of a rate as may be determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The interest rate on any loan (other than a guaranteed loan) to a low income, limited resource borrower under this subchapter shall not be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) greater than the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) an amount that does not exceed one-half of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with maturities of 5 years; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The interest rate on any loan (other than a guaranteed loan) made or insured under clause (5) of section 1942(a) of this title for activities that involve the use of prime farmland as defined in section 1927(a)(6)(C) of this title shall be the interest rate otherwise applicable under this section increased by 2 per centum per annum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Loans made under this subchapter shall be payable in not to exceed seven years. The Secretary may consolidate or reschedule outstanding loans for payment over a period not to exceed seven years (or, in the case of loans for farm operating purposes, fifteen years) from the date of such consolidation or rescheduling, and the amount of unpaid principal and interest of the prior loans so consolidated or rescheduled shall not create a new charge against any loan levels authorized by law. A new loan may be included in a consolidation. Such new loan shall be charged against any loan level authorized by law. Except as otherwise provided for farm loans under section 1981b of this title, the interest rate on such consolidated or rescheduled loans, other than guaranteed loans, may be changed by the Secretary to a rate not to exceed the rate being charged for loans made under this subchapter at the time of the consolidation or rescheduling. The interest rate on any guaranteed loan under this subchapter that may be consolidated or rescheduled for payment shall be such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the lender, but not in excess of a rate as may be determined by the Secretary.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Limitation on loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No loan made or insured under this subchapter may exceed the amount of the actual loss caused by the disaster or $500,000, whichever is less, for each disaster.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Interest rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans under this subchapter shall be at rates of interest as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) For loans or portions of loans up to the amount of the applicant's actual loss caused by the disaster, as limited under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the interest shall be at rates prescribed by the Secretary, but not in excess of 8 percent per annum; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For loans or portions of loans in excess of the amount of the applicant's actual loss caused by the disaster, as limited under subsection (a)(1) of this section, (A) the interest for insured loans shall be at rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans, as determined by the Secretary, and (B) the interest for guaranteed loans shall be at rates agreed on by the borrower and lender, but not in excess of such rates as may be determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For guaranteed loans under this subchapter, the Secretary may pay interest subsidies to the lenders for those portions of the loans up to the amount of the actual loss caused by the disaster, as limited under subsection (a)(1) of this section. Any such subsidy shall not exceed the difference between the interest rate being charged for loans up to the amount of the actual loss, as established under subsection (b)(1) of this section, and the maximum interest rate for guaranteed loans, as established under subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repayment; security; repayment period extension; review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All loans under this subchapter shall be repayable at such times as the Secretary may determine, taking into account the purposes of the loan and the nature and effect of the disaster, but not later than as provided for loans for similar purposes under subchapters I and II of this chapter, and upon the full personal liability of the borrower and upon the best security available, as the Secretary may prescribe: <em>Provided, </em>That the security is adequate to assure repayment of the loans, except that if such security is not available because of the disaster, the Secretary shall (1) accept as security such collateral as is available, a portion or all of which may have depreciated in value due to the disaster and which in the opinion of the Secretary, together with the Secretary's confidence in the repayment ability of the applicant, is adequate security for the loan, and (2) make such loan repayable at such times as the Secretary may determine, not later than as provided under subchapters I and II of this chapter, as justified by the needs of the applicant: <em>Provided further</em>, That for any disaster occurring after January 1, 1975, the Secretary, if the loan is for a purpose described in subchapter II of the chapter, may make the loan repayable at the end of a period of more than seven years, but not more than twenty years, if the Secretary determines that the need of the loan applicant justifies such a longer repayment period: <em>Provided further</em>, That for any direct or insured loan (other than a guaranteed loan) approved under section 1961(b) of this title, three years after the loan is made or insured, and every two years thereafter for the term of the loan, the Secretary shall review the loan; and if, based on such review, the Secretary determines that the borrower is able to <!-- PDFPage:971 -->obtain a loan from non-Federal sources at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, the borrower shall on request by the Secretary, apply for and accept such non-Federal loan in sufficient amount to repay the Secretary. If farm assets (including land, livestock, and equipment) are used as collateral to secure a loan made under this subchapter, the Secretary shall value the assets based on the higher of (A) the value of the assets on the day before the date the governor of the State in which the farm is located requests assistance under this subchapter or the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.] for any portion of such State affected by the disaster with respect to which the application for the loan is made, or (B) the value of the assets one year before such day.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Grant eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any political subdivision of a State with a population of less than ten thousand inhabitants that, if such subdivision had a population of ten thousand or more inhabitants, would be eligible for a grant under the first title of the Community Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1977 shall be eligible for a grant under this chapter during any period in which the Community Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1977 is or has been in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In addition to any other authority that the Secretary may have to defer principal and interest and forego foreclosure, the Secretary may permit, at the request of the borrower, the deferral of principal and interest on any outstanding loan made, insured, or held by the Secretary under this chapter, or under the provisions of any other law administered by the Farmers Home Administration or by the Rural Development Administration, and may forego foreclosure of any such loan, for such period as the Secretary deems necessary upon a showing by the borrower that due to circumstances beyond the borrower's control, the borrower is temporarily unable to continue making payments of such principal and interest when due without unduly impairing the standard of living of the borrower. The Secretary may permit interest that accrues during the deferral period on any loan deferred under this section to bear no interest during or after such period: <em>Provided</em>, That if the security instrument securing such loan is foreclosed such interest as is included in the purchase price at such foreclosure shall become part of the principal and draw interest from the date of foreclosure at the rate prescribed by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;seasoned direct loan borrower&rdquo; means a borrower receiving a direct loan under this chapter who has been classified as &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; or &ldquo;standard&rdquo; under subpart W of part 2006 of the Instruction Manual (as in effect on January 1, 1991).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, or a contracting third party, shall annually review under section 2006b of this title the loans of each seasoned loan borrower. If, based on the review, it is determined that a borrower would be able to obtain a loan, guaranteed by the Secretary, from a commercial or cooperative lender at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, the Secretary shall assist the borrower in applying for the commercial or cooperative loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In accordance with section 2006d of this title, the Secretary shall prepare a prospectus on each seasoned direct loan borrower determined eligible to obtain a guaranteed loan.

<p class="statutory-body">(4) With the approval of the borrower, the Secretary shall provide the prospectus of the seasoned direct loan borrower to each approved lender whose lending area includes the location of the seasoned direct loan borrower. If the Secretary receives an offer from an approved lender to extend credit to the seasoned direct loan borrower under terms and conditions contained in the prospectus, the seasoned direct loan borrower shall not be eligible for an insured loan from the Secretary under subchapter I or II of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Secretary is unable to provide loan guarantees and, if necessary, interest assistance to the seasoned direct loan borrower under this subsection in amounts sufficient to enable the seasoned direct loan borrower to borrow from commercial sources the amount required to carry out a financially viable farming plan, or if the Secretary does not receive an offer from an approved lender to extend credit to a seasoned direct loan borrower under the terms and conditions contained in the prospectus, the Secretary shall make an insured loan to the seasoned direct loan borrower under subchapter I or II of this chapter, whichever is applicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that&mdash;</p>

The County Committee shall classify or reclassify real property (including real property administered by the Secretary on January 6, 1988) that is farmland, as being suitable for farming operation for such disposition unless the property, including property subdivided in accordance with subsection (e)(5) of this section, cannot be used to meet any of the purposes of section 1923 of this title (including being used as a start-up or add-on parcel of farmland). Any property which the Secretary determines to be suitable for such purposes shall, whenever practicable, be sold by the Secretary as expeditiously as possible to such eligible persons in a manner consistent with such provisions. Real property which is not determined suitable for sale to such eligible persons or which has not been purchased by such persons within a period of 12 months from the date first published under paragraph (2)(D), shall be (A) sold by the Secretary after public notice at public sale and, if no acceptable bid is received then by negotiated sale, at the best price obtainable for cash or on <!-- PDFPage:984 -->secured credit without regard to the laws governing the disposition of excess or surplus property of the United States or (B) leased to persons eligible for assistance under the provisions of any law administered by the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration under an annual lease or a lease with an option to purchase, with a preference for sale.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as the Congress may from <!-- PDFPage:992 -->time to time determine to be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this chapter and for the administration of assets transferred to the Farmers Home Administration or the Rural Development Administration.</p>

Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yields of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this chapter. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and for that purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Farmers Home Administration direct loan account; deposits; liabilities; obligations; expenditures; net expenditure basis of budgeting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The appropriations for loans made under the authority of subsection (a) of this section and funds obtained in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the unexpended balances of any funds made available for loans under the item &ldquo;Farmers Home Administration&rdquo; in the Department of Agriculture Appropriation Acts current on August 8, 1961, shall be merged into a single account known as the &ldquo;Farmers Home Administration direct loan account&rdquo;, hereafter in this section called the &ldquo;direct loan account&rdquo;. All claims, notes, mortgages, property, including those now held by the Secretary on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, and all collections therefrom, made or held under the direct loan provisions of (1) titles I, II, and IV of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended; (2) the Farmers Home Administration Act of 1946, as amended, except the assets of the rural rehabilitation corporations; (3) the Act of August 28, 1937 (50 Stat. 869), as amended; (4) the item &ldquo;Loans to Farmers&mdash;1948 Flood Damage&rdquo; in the Act of June 25, 1948 (62 Stat. 1038); (5) the item &ldquo;Loans to Farmers (Property Damage)&rdquo; in the Act of May 24, 1949 (63 Stat. 82); (6) the Act of September 6, 1950 (64 Stat. 769); (7) the Act of July 11, 1956 (70 Stat. 525); (8) section 8 of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, as amended [16 U.S.C. 1006a]; (9) section 32(e) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1011(e)]; and (10) under this chapter shall be held for and deposited in said account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The notes of the Secretary issued to the Secretary of the Treasury under said Acts or under this chapter and all other liabilities against the appropriations or assets in the direct loan account shall be liabilities of said account, and all other obligations against such appropriations or assets shall be obligations of said account. Moneys in the direct loan account shall also be available for interest and principal repayments on notes issued by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury. Otherwise, the balances in said account shall remain available to the Secretary for direct loans under subchapters I or II of this chapter, section 8 of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, as amended [16 U.S.C. 1006a], and section 32(e) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1011(e)], and for advances in connection therewith, not to exceed any existing appropriation or authorization limitations and in such further amounts as the Congress from time to time determines in appropriation Acts. The amounts so authorized for loans and advances shall remain available until expended. Subject to the foregoing limitations, the use of collections deposited in the account may be authorized by the Congress in lieu or partially in lieu of authorizing the issuing of additional notes by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the account shall be budgeted on a net expenditure basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Sale of notes and mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may sell and assign any notes and mortgages in the direct loan account with the consent of the borrower or without such consent when the borrower has failed to comply with his agreement to refinance the indebtedness at the request of the Secretary. Such loans may be sold at the balance due thereon or on such other basis as the Secretary may determine from time to time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distribution of real estate loans among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At least 25 per centum of the sums authorized in any fiscal year for direct loans to individuals to be made by the Secretary under subchapter I of this chapter shall be allocated equitably among the several States and territories on the basis of farm population and the prevalence of tenancy, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Sale by lender and any holder of guaranteed portion of loan pursuant to regulations governing such sales; limitations; issuance of pool certificates representing ownership of guaranteed portion of guaranteed loan; terms and conditions, etc.; reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The guaranteed portion of any loan made under this chapter may be sold by the lender, and by any subsequent holder, in accordance with regulations governing such sales as the Secretary shall establish, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) All fees due the Secretary with respect to a guaranteed loan are to be paid in full before any sale.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:993 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The loan is to have been fully disbursed to the borrower before the sale.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After a loan is sold in the secondary market, the lender shall remain obligated under its guarantee agreement with the Secretary, and shall continue to service the loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for determining the increase of farmers&rsquo; access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This subsection shall not be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made under this chapter, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may, directly or through a market maker approved by the Secretary, issue pool certificates representing ownership of part or all of the guaranteed portion of any loan guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter. Such certificates shall be based on and backed by a pool established or approved by the Secretary and composed solely of the entire guaranteed portion of such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, guarantee the timely payment of the principal and interest on pool certificates issued on behalf of the Secretary by approved market makers for purposes of this subsection. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans that compose the pool. If a loan in such pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or by reason of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the pool certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Secretary only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the pool certificate, the certificate may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts that may be required to be paid under any guarantee of such pool certificates issued by approved market makers under this subsection. The Secretary may expend amounts in the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund to make payments on such guarantees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall not collect any fee for any guarantee under this subsection. The preceding sentence shall not preclude the Secretary from collecting a fee for the functions described in paragraph (3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) pay the registered holder of the certificates an amount equal to the guaranteed portion of the loan represented by the certificate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) If the Secretary pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, the claim shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment, as may be provided by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Secretary of the Secretary's ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the pool against which the certificates are issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the adoption of final rules and regulations, the Secretary shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Provide for the central collection of registration information from all participating market makers for all loans and pool certificates sold under paragraphs (1) and (2). Such information shall include, with respect to each original sale and any subsequent sale, identification of the interest rate paid by the borrower to the lender, the lender's servicing fee, whether interest on the loan is at a fixed or variable rate, identification of each purchaser of a pool certificate, the interest rate paid on the certificate, and such other information as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before any sale, require the seller to disclose to each prospective purchaser of the portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to each prospective purchaser of a pool certificate issued under paragraph (2), information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this subparagraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term &ldquo;seller&rdquo; does not include (i) the person who made the loan or (ii) any person who sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Provide for adequate custody of any pooled guaranteed loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Take such actions as are necessary, in restructuring pools of the guaranteed portion of loans, to minimize the estimated costs of paying claims under guarantees issued under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Require each market maker&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to service all pools formed, and participations sold, by the market maker; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to provide the Secretary with information relating to the collection and disbursement of all periodic payments, prepayments, and default funds from lenders, to or from the reserve fund that the Secretary shall establish to enable the timely payment guarantee to be self-funding, and from all beneficial holders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall modify delinquent farmer program loans made or insured under this chapter, or purchased from the lender or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 1929b of this title, to the maximum extent possible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to avoid losses to the Secretary on such loans, with priority consideration being placed on writing-down the loan principal and interest (subject to subsections (d) and (e) of this section), and debt set-aside (subject to subsection (e) of this section), whenever these procedures would facilitate keeping the borrower on the farm or ranch, or otherwise through the use of primary loan service programs as provided in this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure that borrowers are able to continue farming or ranching operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to obtain assistance under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the delinquency must be due to circumstances beyond the control of the borrower, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary, except that the regulations shall require that, if the value of the assets calculated under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) of this section that may be realized through liquidation or other methods would produce enough income to make the delinquent loan current, the borrower shall not be eligible for assistance under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower must have acted in good faith with the Secretary in connection with the loan as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the borrower must present a preliminary plan to the Secretary that contains reasonable assumptions that demonstrate that the borrower will be able to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the loan, if restructured, must result in a net recovery to the Federal Government, during the term of the loan as restructured, that would be more than or equal to the net recovery to the Federal Government from an involuntary liquidation or foreclosure on the property securing the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restructuring determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of net recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the net recovery from the involuntary liquidation of a loan under this section, the Secretary shall calculate&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of the restructured loan, in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recovery value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of paragraph (1), the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan shall be based on&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the value of the interests of the borrower in all other assets that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) not essential for necessary family living expenses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) not essential to the operation of the farm; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) not exempt from judgment creditors or in a bankruptcy action under Federal or State law; less</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1008 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the estimated administrative, legal, and other expenses associated with the liquidation and disposition of the loan and collateral, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the payment of prior liens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) taxes and assessments, depreciation, management costs, the yearly percentage decrease or increase in the value of the property, and lost interest income, each calculated for the average holding period for the type of property involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) resale expenses, such as repairs, commissions, and advertising; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund for the use of the Board in carrying out the provisions of sections 2007a to 2007e of this title, that shall be known as the &ldquo;Rural Business Investment Fund&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Rural Business Investment Fund shall be available to the Board to provide lines of credit for revolving funds to be operated by approved eligible entities to serve local businesses in rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Lines of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts in the Rural Business Investment Fund shall be used by the Board to provide lines of credit in amounts determined appropriate by the Board, but in no event shall any such line of credit exceed $750,000 annually (up to a total amount of $2,250,000) to an approved eligible entity. Each line of credit shall be made available over a period of time established by the Board for each such entity, but in no event shall any such period of time extend beyond the date on which the Investment Board is terminated under section 2007d(n) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the approved eligible entity is the agency of any State that is primarily responsible for the rural economic development programs within such State, the Board may provide a line of credit to such agency in an amount that shall not exceed $1,250,000 annually (up to a total amount of $3,750,000) in the manner described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amounts drawn from line</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts drawn from each line of credit by each approved eligible entity shall be used solely as provided under sections 2007a to 2007e of this title and shall be drawn only as needed to provide loans, investments, or to carry out a guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applications of eligible entities for lines of credit</h4>
