<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A producer of Valencia peanuts may enter Valencia peanuts that are produced in Texas into the pools of New Mexico in a quantity not greater than the average annual quantity of the peanuts that the producer entered into the New Mexico pools for the 1990 through 1995 crops.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Types of peanuts</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Transfers from additional loan pools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The proceeds due any producer from any pool shall be reduced by the amount of any loss that is incurred with respect to peanuts transferred from an additional loan pool to a quota loan pool by the producer under section 1358&ndash;1(b)(8) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Producers in same pool</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Further losses in an area quota pool shall be offset by reducing the gain of any producer in the pool by the amount of pool gains attributed to the same producer from the sale of additional peanuts for domestic and edible export use.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Offset within area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Further losses in an area quota pool shall be offset by any gains or profits from additional peanuts (other than separate type pools established under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico) owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation in that area and sold for domestic edible use, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary. This paragraph shall not apply to profits or gains from a farm with 1 acre or less of peanut production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) First use of marketing assessments</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Cross compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Further losses in area quota pools, other than losses incurred as a result of transfers from additional loan pools to quota loan pools under section 1358&ndash;1(b)(8) of this title, shall be offset by any gains or profits from quota pools in other production areas (other than separate type pools established under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico) in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Offset generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If losses in an area quota pool have not been entirely offset under the preceding paragraphs, further losses shall be offset by any gains or profits from additional peanuts (other than separate type pools established under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico) owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation and sold for domestic edible use, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary. This paragraph shall not apply to profits or gains from a farm with 1 acre or less of peanut production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Second use of marketing assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall use funds collected under subsection (g) of this section and attributable to handlers to offset further losses in area quota pools. The Secretary shall transfer to the Treasury those funds collected under subsection (g) of this section and available for use under this paragraph that the Secretary determines are not required to cover losses in area quota pools.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Increased assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If use of the authorities provided in the preceding paragraphs is not sufficient to cover losses in an area quota pool, the Secretary shall increase the marketing assessment for producers established under subsection (g) of this section by such an amount as the Secretary considers necessary to cover the losses. The increased assessment shall apply only to quota peanuts in the production area covered by the pool. Amounts collected under subsection (g) of this section as a result of the increased assessment shall be retained by the Secretary to cover losses in that pool.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disapproval of quotas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no loan for quota peanuts may be made available by the Secretary for any crop of peanuts with respect to which poundage quotas have been disapproved by producers, as provided for in section 1358&ndash;1(d) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Quality improvement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) continue to endeavor to operate the peanut program so as to improve the quality of domestic peanuts and ensure the coordination of activities under the Peanut Administrative Committee established under Marketing Agreement No. 146, regulating the quality of domestically produced peanuts (under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that any changes made in the peanut program as a result of this subsection requiring additional production or handling at the farm level shall be reflected as an upward adjustment in the Department loan schedule.</p>
