<p class="note-body">H.R. 1827, referred to in subsec. (c)(2), which would have granted consent to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, the Southern Dairy Compact, the Pacific Northwest Dairy Compact, and the Intermountain Dairy Compact, was not enacted into law during the 107th Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">S. 1157, referred to in subsec. (c)(2), which would have granted consent to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, the Southern Dairy Compact, the Pacific Northwest Dairy Compact, and the Intermountain Dairy Compact, was not enacted into law during the 107th Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 7981 of this title, referred to in subsec. (c)(5), was in the original &ldquo;section 1401&rdquo;, and was translated as reading &ldquo;section 1501&rdquo;, meaning section 1501 of Pub. L. 107&ndash;171 to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 1501 of Pub. L. 107&ndash;171 relates to Federal milk price support program. Section 1401 of Pub. L. 107&ndash;171 amended sections 7272 and 7283 of this title.</p>
