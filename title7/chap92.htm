<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6301. Findings and declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) soybeans are an important source of nutritious foods that are a valuable part of the human diet and are an important feedstuff for the livestock industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the production of soybeans plays a significant role in the economy of the United States in that soybeans are produced by thousands of soybean producers, processed by numerous processing entities, and soybeans and soybean products produced in the United States are consumed by people and livestock throughout the United States and foreign countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) soybeans and soybean products should be readily available and marketed efficiently to ensure that consumers have an adequate supply of soybean products at a reasonable price;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and development of new markets for soybeans and soybean products are vital to the welfare of soybean producers and processors and those concerned with marketing soybeans and soybean products, as well as to the general economy of the United States, and are necessary to ensure the ready availability and efficient marketing of soybeans and soybean products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there exist established State and national organizations conducting soybean promotion, research, and consumer education programs that are valuable to the efforts of promoting the consumption of soybeans and soybean products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the cooperative development, financing, and implementation of a coordinated national program of soybean promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information are necessary to maintain and expand existing markets and develop new markets for soybeans and soybean products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) soybeans and soybean products move in interstate and foreign commerce, and soybeans and soybean products that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce in soybeans and soybean products.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1467 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress declares that it is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided in this chapter, of an orderly procedure for developing, financing through assessments on domestically-produced soybeans, and implementing a program of promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information designed to strengthen the soybean industry's position in the marketplace, to maintain and expand existing domestic and foreign markets and uses for soybeans and soybean products, and to develop new markets and uses for soybeans and soybean products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter may be construed to provide for the control of production or otherwise limit the right of individual producers to produce soybeans.</p>

To the extent practicable, each combined unit shall have an average annual production of soybeans of at least 3,000,000 bushels.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (F), the Secretary shall determine average annual soybean production applicable to a crop year by using the average of the 5 previous crops of soybeans, excluding the crop in which production was the highest and the crop in which production was the lowest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">At the end of each 3 year period beginning with the 3 year period starting on the effective date of the order, the Secretary, if necessary, shall adjust any unit to conform with subparagraphs (A) and (B). If the Secretary makes such an adjustment, the Secretary shall reapportion the seats on the Board to conform with subparagraph (C) and any modifications made under subparagraph (F). If payment of refunds following the initial referendum conducted under section 6305(a) of this title is authorized by producers, in making such adjustments, the Secretary shall exclude, from each State's annual soybean production, those bushels of soybeans on which such refunds are paid.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Adjustment of levels of production</h4>

The Secretary may amend the order to make such changes in levels of production used to determine per-unit representation. Any such amendment to the order shall not be subject to a referendum of producers. A unit may not, as a result of any modification under this subparagraph, lose Board seats to which it is entitled at the time the order is initially issued unless its average annual production, as determined under subparagraph (D), declines below the levels required for representation, as specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C).</p>

Each such temporary member shall be appointed for a single term not to exceed 3 years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Representation of certain States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall make temporary appointments to the initially-established Board to ensure, to the extent practicable, that each State with a State soybean board that, prior to November 28, 1990, was contributing State soybean promotion and research assessment funds to national soybean promotion and research efforts has representation on the initially-established Board that reflects the relative contributions of such State to the national soybean promotion and research effort.</p>
