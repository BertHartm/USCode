<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Agricultural credit programs assigned before October 13, 1994, by law to the Farmers Home Administration (including farm ownership and operating, emergency, and disaster loan programs) and other lending programs for agricultural producers and others engaged in the production of agricultural commodities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Subchapter B of chapter 1 of subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831&ndash;3836).</p>

Such rules shall ensure that technical criteria established by the Natural Resources Conservation Service shall be used by the Consolidated Farm Service Agency as the basis for any decisions regarding technical determinations. If no review is requested, the technical determination of the Natural Resources Conservation Service shall be the technical basis for any decision rendered by a county or area committee established under section 590h(b)(5) of title 16. If the committee requests a review by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of a wetlands determination of the Service, the Consolidated Farm Service Agency shall consult with other Federal agencies whenever required by law or under a memorandum of agreement in existence on October 13, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Economic hardship</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reinstatement of program benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Rules issued to carry out this subsection shall provide for the prompt reinstatement of benefits to a producer who is determined in an administrative appeal to meet the requirements of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 [16 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.] applicable to the producer.</p>
