<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this chapter (but not in any wise limiting the definition of interstate commerce in section 2 of this title) a transaction in respect to any article shall be considered to be in interstate commerce if such article is part of that current of commerce usual in the commodity trade whereby commodities and commodity products and by-products thereof are sent from one State, with the expectation that they will end their transit, after purchase, in another, including in addition to cases within the above general description, all cases where purchase or sale is either for shipment to another State, or for manufacture within the State and the shipment outside the State of the products resulting from such manufacture. Articles normally in such current of commerce shall not be considered out of such commerce through resort being had to any means or device intended to remove transactions in respect thereto from the provisions of this chapter. For the purpose of this section the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes Territory, the District of Columbia, possession of the United States, and foreign nation.</p>
